BNC processor.
By default, the BNC 2554 folder must be next to the bnc_processor.py script (so that the relative path to the BNC 'Texts' folder is '2554/2554/download/Texts). You can download the corpus from here: http://ota.ox.ac.uk/text/2554.zip
The Stanford parser jar file locations need to be by default at he same level as bnc_processor.py. That is, folder 'stanford-parser-full-2017-06-09' (https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-parser-full-2017-06-09.zip), 'stanford-postagger-2017-06-09' (https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-postagger-2017-06-09.zip) and 'stanford-ner-2017-06-09' (https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-ner-2017-06-09.zip). You can run the bnc_processor.py script directly for an example usage, though most likely you'll want to stop it or else it will keep printing utterance data until the end.
