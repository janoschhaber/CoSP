B: and I 've had , now I have twenty-three thousand miles on it .
A: Oh , that 's great --
B: Yeah .
A: -- that 's great .
A: That 's always nice to get , uh , reliability in a product . Especially when you 're spending , you know , anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars for , for a single item .
B: Right .
A: You know ,
A: you just do n't want any hassles --
B: No .
A: -- with it .
A: You just , you expect it to do its , its job ,
A: and I think a lot of , a lot of car manufacturers do n't really keep that into consider- , do n't take that into consideration --
B: Yeah .
A: -- you know .
B: Yeah ,
B: that 's true .
A: They just expect you to buy their product ,
A: but that 's always been something that 's been a key factor in me , is how reliable is this car going to be --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- you know .
A: Price is , is an issue ,
A: but it 's not the most important issue .
B: No ,
B: it really is n't , because now you can get like five year financing on them
B: and --
A: Right .
B: -- so , um ,
B: but I , I , I would go with the General Motors any time .

B: Yeah ,
B: well sure .
A: You know , it 's American made too --
B: Right .

A: ever since I guess I , I was growing up , my dad 's always had Fords ,
A: and , uh , well , I grew up in South Dakota .
A: So everybody has a truck --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- and my Ford trucks have just ,
A: I 've , I 've just never had problems with them .
B: Uh-huh .
A: I honestly think I would die before my truck would ,
A: keel over on me .

B: yeah ,
B: those are good products also .
B: Um , let 's see ,
