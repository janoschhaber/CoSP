Do yo- , are you on a reg , regular exercise program right now ? Yes , and I hate it .  How about you ? Oh , well , I 'm kind of off and on . 

Off and on well , I guess I 've been kind of off and on I 've , uh , Right now I 'm kind of off . Had some health problems that have led me to , uh , I 'd say more on than off . Okay , what type of exercise do you do ? Uh , I do walking on the treadmill , and then I do low impact aerobics . Okay . 

I guess you do n't enjoy that very much . Not , not really . Do you find that , uh , to be boring ? Yeah , and time consuming , 

I mean it 's not just the exercise that 's boring and time consuming , it 's , uh , you know , afterwards , you know , then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up , you know . Yeah .  Well , I 'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring . Oh , yeah . But I , 

Do you go through this , is this something that you go through every year . Yeah , I have n't decided whether , whether I want to play yet or not I just bought myself a solo flex machine , I do n't know if you 've seen those advertised on T V . Uh-huh . It 's one of those , uh , universal type machines , exercise machines . But I have n't really sat down and used it match yet , so it 's collecting dust right now . Yeah , a lot of things do that . 

I had an , I used to jog somewhat . I had an exercise bike 

I use to have one , and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it , but I do use my treadmill . Uh-huh , well , that 's good . Yeah , my parents have a treadmill it 's , when I go visit them , uh , I get on that thing every now and then . Yeah , it 's nice because when the weather 's bad you ca n't , you do n't have any excuse . Uh-huh , I just got the bicycle out today , and it was real nice outside , 

had to get out to do something . Yeah , I ca n't ride a bike so . I 've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold so thought I , Oh . better , better get outside and do something and not waist the day . Yeah , it 's too nice , it 's been too nice all weekend . 

But , uh , yeah , I need to start jog something again . I 've always of that to be , uh , really one of the best forms of exercise , but it 's terribly boring , and so I really do n't ever keep a program up consistently . 

Have you ever had any injuries from jogging ? No , I never have . Well , I do n't job enough I think to develop any injuries I usually only go about a mile or two . I guess it worries me about jogging it 's that I hear that it 's very hard on your body and , and that , you know , you can end up getting hurt , Yeah , worse . it 's , it 's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete , Uh-huh . 

or on asphalt . Suppose to be much better if you find grass , uh , or , or dirt to jog on . Yeah , that 's not quite so , You have to have the right , so easy . type of shoes too , that 's , Yeah . very important . Yeah . 

I found that , But , true especially from walking on toe and fronts . Yeah , I do n't have to buy jogging shoes all to often my do n't get very much use . Well , I guess my breakdown about , they say about every six months . Uh-huh . 

I usually enjoy the exercise I do but , uh , like I said I 'm just not very consistent about maintaining a , a program . So I 'll , I 'll bicycle I get into that for , for a little while and maybe go out , uh , on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile , but then I 'll get tired of doing that ,  and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week . MUMBLEx . But , uh , that gets old too in a very short order , Yeah . I 'm , I 'm hoping that this , uh , solo flex will , uh , uh , change things a little bit , I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis . Yeah , well , do n't let it collect dust . At least exercise while dusting it off . Yeah . well . 

Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can , uh , start some type of , uh , regular program . Yeah , that , that 'll be good . I 've always found that , uh , when you write things down and set goals it 's a lot easier to keep , uh , keep something going . Uh-huh . Uh , when I was in high school we had a choice of , uh , taking , uh , physical education courses on exercise , an , uh , one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine , lifting weights and , Oh . uh , working out like that . And that was very helpful we kept charts of our progress , Uh-huh . and , uh , consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks . I found that to be , uh , very helpful . 

Are you going to do that ? Uh , I need to ,  I have n't started yet but , uh , it 's a thought . Well , that sounds like something good to do then . Sounds like something I should do . Yeah , 

nice way to start off this spring .  Get back in shape . How often do you , uh , uh , go out each week on your walking ? Well , I do , I switch every other day one day I walk and one day I do the aerobics . Okay , how far , about how far do you go walking ? Well , I 'm trying to get my tolerance now I just had surgery , um , less then two months ago , and right now I 'm just a little over about a mile and a half , Okay . but I 'm trying to workup to three miles . Well , that 's good . Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging . Yeah , It , it takes , it 's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect . Sure . Yeah , but . Well , if you keep up with a consistent pace just to , uh , keep the heart rating going , uh , My walkman broke , Yeah . so I 'm upset ,  and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud . Yeah .  But it 's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is . Yeah , it is and this does n't , you know , my treadmill has an incline 

and , you know , you can get a really good workout on it . Um , do you go to an aerobics class or do you watch , No , I , on T V ? I just do it on T V , Okay . I have a cassette . Which , uh , shows do you watch on T V ? Um , it 's a , it 's a tap- , I use tapes . 

Oh , okay , okay , like a Cathy Smith workout , Or , or Richard Simmons , 

or Jane Fonda .  Okay . Sweating to the oldies . Right . I , ev- , every now and then I 'll watch E S P N , I get cable on T V , Uh-huh . and they have , uh , a couple of shows called basic training , and , uh , what is the other one called . There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N , I do n't know if he 's still on any more or not , I don- , I do n't know if I get E S P N or not . Uh-huh . But , uh , one , you know , I use to watch one , watch one on the air , but that was back , BODIES IN MOTION that 's , that 's the name of the one I was thinking of . That 's was , yeah . With Gill . Yeah . MUMBLEx . Yeah , I watched that cause he was cute . Yeah , he- , he- , he 's not bad his assistants usually are n't either .   But , uh , They 're always in , in Hawaii some place . Yeah , yeah . On , on the beach . 

But then that was back when , uh , you know , the high impact and , Yeah , well , they , they do low I pact stuff now , Do they . Are the- , yeah they 're still , they 're still , he 's still doing it then , uh . Yeah , 

every morning . I 'll have to tune in . It 's on E S P N , uh , at what time , I ca n't remember what time . It 's , uh , you know , I ca n't remember offhand what time . I 'll have to check it , check , Yeah MUMBLEx . check , check it back up , 

and , but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show , at least on MUMBLEx . Yeah , every now and then . Not everybody has a picture perfect body . Uh-huh , 

well , I found that they , they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V . I have n't watch any other ones on T V . They 're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day . Just on some of the tapes . Monday through Friday incase you 're interested in that . Okay , thanks . but , Now , that 's a thought . 

uh , I have n't done so much as , uh , watch the tape that I made .  So I 'm kind of bad about that myself . Well , that 's thought , 

I have n't thought about that , well they 're going to beep us pretty soon . Okay , well , I sure enjoyed , Nice talking to you too . to you about exercise and fitness . Okay , thanks . So , all right . Talk to you later . Good night . Bye . Bye .
