Well , Hal , what 's , uh , what 's crime like in Dallas ? Well , it depends where in Dallas you are . Uh-huh . There are certainly parts of town I would not want to live in . Yeah . Because it 's the situation it is very location dependent -- Uh-huh . -- and there are parts of town here where , when they talk about the nightly gunfire . Oh , yeah . Yeah , in Baltimore we have similar . Uh , I live on the outskirts of Baltimore and , uh , we live right outside the city and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people , though I 'm in graduate school , uh , I live here because it 's close to the university . Uh-huh . But , you know , we have , uh , it , it 's really funny , the only crime we really see is , uh , just the kids being malicious . Uh-huh . You know , and I think most of that is because their parents are n't around . That make sense ? Yeah . Yeah . That , uh , the , what they call the latchkey children . Yeah , something like that . No one 's , you know , or , or fathers are just missing , you know , so there 's no , uh , no consistency there in the home or whatever . 

There 's no one to tell them what 's right and what 's wrong , you know . Yeah . The sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class so -- Uh-huh . -- I think our , uh , not that we do n't have a certain amount of local problems -- Uh-huh . -- but on the other hand , uh , we get the , uh , affect of the , uh , the city and , uh , the main crimes within the suburb here are the , the theft crimes . Uh-huh . A small number of assaults , uh , well , if we have one murder a year -- Yeah . -- that 's probably as many , but then , you know , you go into Dallas and they are , unfortunately -- Uh-huh . -- uh , having murders -- Yeah . -- at a rate greater than one a day . Yeah , 

I think that 's , we 're about the same in Baltimore . Though , uh , Washington , I think is , uh , close by and , you know , they experience a lot more . Uh-huh . I think they definitely have more problems that , uh , in , in the area . What , what do you think can prevent crime ? 

Well , the thing is , I do n't , it 's one of those things where , if you 're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on -- Uh-huh . -- Unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like , uh , wherever there are more , uh , criminals , there are more policemen -- Yeah . -- but that 's which came first . Yeah . But , on the other side of it is it 's , it 's basically the , the problem is within the , in the society -- Uh-huh . -- and the society 's views and , well , uh , since now I 'm in my mid-forties , when I was in grad school or when I was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area -- Uh-huh . -- I thought , you know , crime was , was reasonably unknown -- Yeah . -- and just the situation that 's developed with the , the drug -- Yeah , -- aspect of , uh -- Uh-huh . -- uh , the pushers , the dealers and the addicts , uh , Yeah , 

I , I , I think , I agree with you there . Because it just was not , uh , something back in the sixties that -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I even had to worry about . But I think , you know , that there is a lot in the society where things have changed , uh , so it 's effected all of us . Uh-huh . Yeah , 

I think they , the drug culture definitely has , uh , is one of the main problems . Yeah , Uh-huh . Because it would eliminate the , uh , the violence and the , uh , the under- , the , the market , I guess , the , the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it . Uh-huh . That make sense ? He 's one of the big proponents of that . He gets on national television and , and says that , you know . So it 's , uh , and he was a d- , d- , a District Attorney before , and a prosecutor before becoming , becoming mayor . So that 's a really stran , you know , it 's a different viewpoint . I , uh , You know , in a sense I do n't , I 'm n- , I have real mixed feelings on that -- Yeah . -- because it comes a bit from the angle that the , uh , uh , it would certainly be an interesting test -- Uh-huh . -- but the other side of it , to me , What happens if we lose worse . Uh , y- , well , the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side , and I think if I look back fifty or a hundred years I 'd say , you know , back then there were the opium dens -- Right . -- but the thing is , if somebody ruined their life , uh , society did n't try to then save themselves from it , they let this person who had ruined it -- Uh-huh . -- uh , become , well , die or whatever . I mean -- Right , yeah . -- they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short , 

but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise , we need to take care of people even if they have , you know , physically ruined themselves . Yeah , they have induced it themselves . Yeah -- Yeah , that 's true . -- and so , to me that 's , I , uh , I would certainly like to see a real test of , of making drugs real cheap -- Uh-huh . -- to see if when you make them available people then do n't use them . Uh-huh . Well I think -- -- you know , they did that in Alaska . That , that actually , Alaska just recently legalized marijuana . Uh-huh . But I never , I never heard results or anything like that , so I never , you know , plus , that 's such a , that 's not a true , uh , you know , it really could n't be a good test because Alaska 's so different than every other part of the country . Uh-huh . You know , so that , but that was interesting , you know , I , I do n't , crime is one of those things that 's , uh , I , I do n't know , you know , the drug culture , the , uh , the , uh , you know , I , I see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things , not thinking anything wrong with it . Yeah , 

well , th- , some of that , and , of course , I 'm a baby of the old school -- Yeah . -- but , it , it bothers me from the fifties on , not that I 'd remember that much -- Uh-huh . -- from the fifties but , but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality . Yeah , that 's true . That 's true . We worked hard for everything . That 's very true . And so they -- Uh-huh . -- in the , there were the sixty-four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties , 

but nowadays , there 's so much on TV where , where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing . Of course -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I work for lawyers a lot and I see , unfortunately , we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and , you know , there 's a million dollars you can have -- Uh-huh . -- uh , for mental duress or whatever . Yeah . But , you know , the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the , uh , in Europe , they seem to have mentality , and drunk driving is a good one , is that people are well indoctrinated in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable . Right . And , yeah , if you 're going to drink , and you may drink , you better have your designated driver . Uh-huh . Yeah . And we mean it . Yeah . That , I think that , uh , the drunk driving has just actually , just caught on . Uh , Uh-huh . 

A- , and I , I , I really , uh , my father was hit by a drunk driver when I was in high school -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , that was a very , uh , that , that was an awful three years afterwards . You know , of recovery -- Uh-huh . -- and the difficulties and , uh , everything we did and , you know , the guy went free because this was twelve years ago -- Uh-huh . -- thirteen years ago , there was no , his father was even , the , uh , police chief of the town . Uh-huh . So there was no repercussion at all . You know , other than insurance , but he was uninsured . Yeah . So , uh , our insurance paid for everything , but it was a very difficult time and , and then later , this was actually funny , my brother and I were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a , a new car and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it -- Uh-huh . -- and broke all his windows and his lights and his , dented it everywhere , and they came and questioned us . Yeah . You know , and , 

But , that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking -- Right . -- and driving was , uh , misplaced -- Uh-huh . -- for years -- -- that , you know , it was an acceptable social behavior . Uh-huh . Yeah , very much so . Yeah , that , those are some important points . Yeah , I , that 's , those are , What are , what does your city have for gun control if anything ? Well , see Maryland is one of the most , we just voted in , uh , gun control , strong gun control here in the state of Maryland . I , I think ,
