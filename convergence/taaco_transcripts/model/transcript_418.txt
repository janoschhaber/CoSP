So , how is the weather out there ? Uh , it 's really cold and it 's supposedly for this time of the year it 's unseasonably cold and they 've gotten more snow than they 've ever had . Oh , really ? You have , breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff . How about you guys ? Um . Uh , it 's just , it 's a , it 's about same . The usual , I think . Oh . 

So , nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff . It 's good . Yeah , well the weather , let 's see , well , the snow here is different from Utah 's , because I have lived in Utah for like ten years . Oh , really ? What part ? And , uh , Provo . I was going to B Y U . Oh , really ? Okay . Yeah . And , uh , the snow is like , really cold . I mean , it 's , like , really humid so it seems wetter or something like that . It 's , It 's more humid in Utah than there ? Uh-huh . Or there ? It 's more humid in Iowa -- Okay . 

-- than Utah . Right . Yeah . Okay . And it seems like when the winds blow , it 's really , it goes right through you . It 's really different from Utah 's weather . I thought Utah was cold , but I think Iowa is a lot colder . Yeah , see , that 's how it is in Texas , too because when it 's cold , it 's really cold . So , Yeah , I do n't think there is any mountains to stop the wind . What 's that ? I do n't think there is any mountains to stop the wind . Right . Yeah . So the humidity is I think what does it . Yeah , I think that 's true . Because I , I noticed when I got here , too , because like I 'd , when it would snow in Texas -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I would just , I mean we 'd be f- , really cold 

and we 'd have to get really warm , and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it 's snowing and you do n't -- Yeah , yeah , 

that 's true . -- you do n't feel super cold . It was weird . Yeah . But , so how long ago did you graduate ? Or did you , or , 

Uh , I graduated in nineteen eighty-seven . Oh , really ? Yeah , my husband got his doctorate at B Y U , so that 's , and so he just graduated this past year . Oh . 

So you just barely moved away ? Uh-huh . Yeah , Do you like it out there ? Well , we really miss Utah . We miss -- You do ? 

-- the mountains . Yeah . Because it 's , like , really flat here . Well , not flat , but hilly . But no big mountains or anything . Uh-huh . 

So you just moved away a year ago ? Uh , in August . Wow , really recent . Yeah . But , uh , see , see what else can I say about the weather . Uh , , well , today was warmer . It was like forty-five . Oh , warm . So , what 's the temperature up today over there ? Oh , man , 

it 's got to be like , it 's probably fifty , fifty-five , maybe . Oh , really ? Maybe not that warm . Probably about , uh , yeah . It 's not , it 's not that cold , really . And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah , I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill . Yeah . But they talk about wind chill here all the time . Yeah , that 's a big deal in Texas , too . 

They said it could be , like , six degrees out and , like , negative forty-one wind chill . Um . So , that 's what we 're not used to . Yeah , that 's true . That makes a big difference . Huh . So , oh , I , 

So , did you used to ski when you were out here ? What 's that ? Did you used to ski when you were in Utah ? Oh , I 've only , I 've only skied in Utah once . Oh , really ? I only skied once my whole life . But , do you do a lot of skiing there ? Uh , not tons , but I like to when I get a chance . Uh-huh . I 've only been once so far , but had the opportunity a couple times since then . Just saving my money for Christmas things -- Yeah . -- and that . So is this your first year in Utah ? Uh , no , this is actually my third year . And you 're going to school there ? Uh-huh . Oh . Yep . At U of U , or , No , at B Y U . Oh , really ? Yeah . Oh . 

So , but , I 'll be here a long time , at this rate . What 's your major ? Uh , it was nursing , 

but I 'm in the process of changing it right now . Uh-huh , oh . Because it 's really , really competitive at B Y U . Yeah . You have to have like a three seven to get in so , That 's true . It 's really , I 'm going to look into some other fields . I 'd like , all the science classes and that , I 'm just not really enjoying too much so -- Uh-huh . -- I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school so , Yeah , that 's , that 's a good idea . Did you graduate in a certain field or , Uh , education . I got a double major . In , Uh , elementary and special ed . Really ? Uh-huh . 

That what my sister did . Oh , really ? Yeah , you might know her . Here name is Lori , Bird . Maybe not . I think she graduated around then , too , though , eighty-seven probably , but , she got her doc- , Yeah , well , I ca n't , there are so many girls in all my classes , 

I ca n't remember -- Yeah , yeah . -- how many people . Because they , since , uh , stopped that program . I mean , where you can -- 

Oh , have they ? -- where you can get it double pretty easily . Oh . I mean , it 's , it 's really ,
