Okay , um . How has it been this week for you ? Weather-wise , or otherwise ? Weather-wise . Weather-wise . Damp , cold , warm . Oh , no , damp . 

We have , we have gone through , what might be called the four seasons , uh , in the last week . Uh-huh . We have had highs of seventy-two , lows in the twenties . My goodness . 

Well , I do n't even want to tell you what ours has been like then . It was ninety-six yesterday , I heard about that . and we set a record yesterday . And , uh , very windy , but then today the wind has dropped off , and also , the temperature , so , very cool , uh , I think right now it 's like sixty-nine , Um . and that 's cool for u- , or it feels cool compared to yesterday , but very pleasant , no rain in the last month , I do n't think . The ground 's very dry and our yard work , everything is in bloom , so our yard work is pretty tough , the ground being dry , but I guess it also , uh , brings about allergies , we 're having a lot of allergies down here right now . Uh-huh . 

Everything blooming , and , and the weather . Uh-huh . And , uh , I think a lot of people have contracted , uh , spring fever too , so . Had a lot of people out at work , you know , for fishing , and , and uh , and golfing , reasons and things like that . The blue flu , Yeah . yeah , 

the blue flu , or the white collar flu , depending on where you work , I guess . Yes . Oh , we have had , uh , as I 've said , we have had variable weather . Uh , Um . It has been untypically wet for this time of year , Um . and , also , we have a lot of green , you know , the grass has been growing and if you look outside , you would like to go out and mow your lawn , Uh . if you could go out and buy a new spark plug , or something along those lines , but fortunately it rains and you , uh , do not have to go out and buy the spark plug , Yeah . you know . But , we 've had an unusually , uh , uh , warm spring , and , well I guess we 're still in winter , and , uh , Uh-huh . we have had no snow . No snow ? To speak of , to speak of . Um . We usually average , oh , anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter and this year , as well as last year , we have had less than four inches total accumulation . Um . So , it 's been inordinately warm , uh , here , for , uh , for this time of year . Um . So , uh , in that regard , it 's fine , but , uh , Uh-huh . I envy you your ninety-four degrees . I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday . Yes , yes it is . Down in the more southern and western areas . And , of course we are , um , about two hours from the northern border , straight south , Yeah . and , and , uh , very windy . 

It 's amazing to me because I have only lived in Dallas for three years , and I can not believe that the wind blows all the time . It does , I , I very seldom , if any , I ca n't remember , you know , a day that I walked out and the wind was n't blowing . Uh-huh Well , I spent six years in graduate school at , in Indiana . In the flatlands , and it was that way every day . Um . Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour . Um . 

Summer and winter , so , that , uh , you , you became accustomed to it , I guess . Uh-huh . But , uh , otherwise w- , as I said , we have had , uh , a relatively mild winter , Uh-huh . speaking for this area of the country . Oh , rea- , where did you go to school in Indiana ? Purdue . Purdue . I have a brother that lives in , uh , uh , South Bend , Indiana . 

Oh , yes . And , I had to always , I 've lived there for eight years myself . I 'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame . But , I did n't . Uh . 

Well , you are not from that area originally , I can tell . No , originally I 'm from New Mexico . Oh , okay . I was born in New Mexico and we lived in , uh , South Bend for eighty , eight years , and , uh , then moved to , uh , Tennessee actually . Uh-huh . And , uh , 

Well , I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere . Very much , very much , cause I , I spent thirteen years there . Uh-huh . And , uh , then moved to Dallas about three years ago . So , Gee , you 've moved almost , moved around as much as I have . 

Yeah , uh , my father was in the Air Force , so , Oh , I see . Uh-huh . Well , I worked for the government , 

so I , I moved , uh , much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years , Uh-huh . but , uh , I guess the , uh , this is my first conversation in this , uh , uh , series . Oh , uh-huh . I , I received a call last night because of the , uh , I had not received my , uh , personal identification number . Right . So , I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was , because I , I had to abort the call last evening because I could n't get on the line . Yeah . 

So , uh , is there any , I 'm not sure how long we 're supposed to talk . It 's , um , it 's just as long as you want to . Oh . O- , I mean it 's just , uh , as long as you want to , and just , you know , a reasonable lengthy conversation . Uh , do you work for Texas Instruments ? No , I do not . I work for G T E . Oh , okay . 

And , I , uh , of course , was , I was sent a , uh , an application from , uh , from Jack . Uh-huh . I 've known Jack for some time . I 'm in the speech processing business , Oh , okay . and have been for a number of years , so I was very much interested , Yeah . in , in being a speaker for this . Well , actually , I , I work for Texas Instruments , and , uh , I 'm an a , I 'm an environmental engineer , 

Oh , I see . and , uh , they just published this internally , you know , getting people involved . Uh-huh . So , that , that 's really strange . I , I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though . I was saying , God , do we have a TI in Maryland or , I 'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area . Uh-huh . If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative , 

and , um , but I have , uh , I have been a speaker in other , uh , similar type of activities . Uh-huh . And , I know the reason why this is , why the , uh , this is being gathered and the program and so forth , so , I was interested as I said , I was interested in being a speaker . Uh-huh . We have n't talked much about the weather . Oh , well . I know that 's what we 're supposed to do . Yeah , yeah . Well , really it , uh , the letter just says , um , let 's see , I ca n't , I was looking at it , I was trying to find out speedy short cuts , and I always thought it 's not necessary to measure your time , just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation , and , and , end it when needed . So . Uh-huh . 

In environmental engineering , uh , Uh-huh . is that with regard to work place engineering , or just , you know , environm- , the work place environment or , Uh , well , it 's actually , um , waste water . Oh , I see . Taking , taking care of uh , 

I 'm actually in the air division , and we monitor , um , anything that comes out of a stack , or out of a building , or , um , we do have customers that , um , their concerns are in the work place and we take care of that , but MUMBLEx , Uh-huh . within our department . We take care of everything . Waste water , uh , solid waste , and recycling , and , and air and , Well , I had 

my , the , the call last evening was supposed to be about , uh , concerning recycling , Oh , uh-huh . in the community . The call I received , and so , I had , uh , I had thought a little bit about it , um , Uh-huh . before hand . Oh , uh-huh . So , I , but that , that 's interesting . I have a , uh , uh , friend who is a planner . Oh , uh-huh . Uh , a city planner . And , one of his , and he models , uh , city districts , and so forth , Uh-huh . uh , does computer modeling . Yeah . And , one of the , uh , he has inputs , or gets inputs from , uh , an environmental engineer . MUMBLEx . Uh-huh . Yeah , we actually , our division is corporate wide , and we take care of just the Dallas area . Uh-huh . Of course we have several plants here , but , um , we do air modeling also . 

Oh , I see . And , and , yeah , I take care of all the air modeling , specifically for the Dallas area . What we do , we have a weather station , that we get all of this information , you know , temperature , wind speed , wind direction , and , uh , we have a huge chemical data base . Well , that 's interesting . And , uh , our , our chemical data base , so that we know every chemical on site and , and , um , its concentration , and if , if anything ever happened , God forbid , you know , a building explosion or something tha , we 'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station .
