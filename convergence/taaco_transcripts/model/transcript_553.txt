Hi . So , do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have ? Uh , actually no , because , because I 'm in school . I , I kind of miss out on most of the current events . I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it . 

Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then ? Uh , I do n't watch a lot of it , but that 's the on , basically that 's my only major source of information . Um . What about , what about you ? Well , I read , uh , 

I get a bunch of different things . I get a newspaper every day and I try to at , at least have a few minutes to look through that and I look through , uh , I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I , I pretty much read that cover to cover and I , as far as , you know , that satisfies most of the short term news I get . Uh , do n't watch much T V , do n't have enough time and , uh , do n't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that , you know , they might give you a little blurbs like -- Yeah . -- this happened or that happened and that 's about all I ever hear of it . Uh , but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK and for the longer term I , I read , uh , like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and , and , uh , READERS ' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which , they , the news is n't , like , immediate what you 'd generally think of as news , but it 's recent material . And it 's more in depth . Yeah , 

it is , it is more in depth , less broad . Well , actually , it 's , probably is n't less broad , but it 's just more in depth and , uh , it is , it is more sig , it is more just significant information , you know . It is the big events , not the little events . Yeah . Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main , you know . I know , where they 're just trying to fill in . Yes , or they 're making , making time because they to fill in an hour 's worth of news . Yeah . Uh , I get kind of bored watching T V actually , when I watch the news on T V because -- I know , I do , I do , too . 

-- it goes so slow and , then there 's nothing that , you know , really is like oh , so exciting . Yeah , you may find one little , uh , news item interesting so you have to wait twenty minutes to , to hear about it . Yeah , that , that 's about what it ends up being . Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something . Yeah , 

actually , y- , you mention NEWSWEEK , I , I , I do like , uh , U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT . I do n't get to read it as much as I like , but that 's , I think that 's a good magazine . Yeah , I think they 're about the same . 

I , you know , they , they certainly have a very similar , uh , charter at least in my mind . And , uh , uh , what , what kind of , uh , what kind of news normally interests you , I mean what do you , what , what do you find interesting -- Well -- -- versus what do you find boring ? -- right now trying to keep abreast of , uh , what 's going on in Europe , you know , with all the , U S S R 's satellites breaking off , trying to become independent and , you know , European community coming together . Uh-huh . That 's going to affect our , uh , economy quite a bit . I think it will , uh , they , they keep claiming it 's going to have a big influence , but we 've yet to see it and th- , it 's real short term yet , though , I mean , it 's only been , three months or something like that -- Oh , yeah . 

-- since that happened so , Yeah . But they like to tell us that it 's going to be important . I 'm , I 'm pretty sure it is , because , uh -- 

I think it is , too . -- once , once Europe becomes unified and , uh , their economy becomes one big economy we 're going to be , uh , kind of hurting . Yeah , I , I think that 's a possibility , uh , it , we might also be helped , though , because it , it will be easier to do business over there , too . Yeah , definitely . For the companies that already have a presence over there and , uh , I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it -- 

Oh , yeah -- -- came time . -- so they have a toe hold , I good toe hold . Yep . Because once you 're in there , then you can easily expand . But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult . Yeah , because , when they first start off , they 're going to be highly protectionist so , Yes . Yeah . 

And there 's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist , even amongst themselves , they 're being somewhat protectionist , you know . Yeah . Like , England does n't want to do one thing and , and Sweden does n't want to do other thing and they 're , they 've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet . Uh-huh . And some of it , I mean , is , I 'm sure within those people 's minds , it 's quite justified . Yeah , 

I , I can understand their viewpoint , they 're just , they 're starting off , their economy 's a little bit weak , so you want to -- Uh-huh . -- get established before they -- Before they -- -- com- , -- open up their borders to everyone . Yeah , totally . Uh , what is the , uh , do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that ? 

Actually I 'm not really into sports . My roommates are , so , unfortunately , I forced to watch quite a bit of sports . Against your will . Yeah , we have to , fight over the remote control . Yeah , at least you guys have a remote control . It 's sometimes better to not have one of those . Course , you can always mislocate it . Or misplace it , I mean , not mislocate it , but misplace it and ,
