I guess we 're be , recorded . Okay . What , do you have any hobbies that you like to do ? Oh , yes . Cycling , computers , uh , backpacking , just about everything . Oh . Oh , I generically have , you know , millions of hobbies . All right , that 's an interesting assortment . My husband is into cycling . In fact , he 's out there right now -- Uh-huh . -- before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the , the time . I 'm not quite that bad . I 'm just a weekend cyclist . Uh , do you have any , do you do any handicraft type things , I think was the question . Handicraft type things . Yeah , whittling or , Yeah , just whittle away my life . Uh , no , no , I c , Nothing like that . Uh , uh , I , I do some things . I 've gotten into , uh , oh , I , I like to decorate things and I do sweatshirts and T-shirts and I 've gotten to where I start , have started selling them at craft shows and things . Oh , that 's pretty good . Uh , and I have , have done fairly well at them . I 've had a , a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed , but most , of them have worked out pretty good . Yeah , they , 

my only craft work is kind of like computers and , you know , go off to the little computer club meetings , and , it 's kind of nice because I 've made money at it , too . Considering I , I work for it a living , but I , you know , I , I 've got a couple of articles published . Oh ! It 's kind of , kind of neat . Yeah , what , what does a computer club do . 

I did n't know there were such things . Oh , yeah , just all over the place . They just get around and , and talk techy or , or else , uh , uh , you know , like half the members are really expert and the other half are like really not . Uh-huh . And , uh , we kind of help out the people who are really not . 

You do n't , uh , you 're not in- , into hacking or whatever . Oh , I , I think I 'm , I think I 'm a hacker , but I 'm not , not kind , not the , uh , the , you know , dial around randomly trying to break into computers type -- Uh-huh . 

-- hackers , no , that 's one of those sports I do n't go for . Well , that 's kind of interesting hobby . What else , did you , you said you did cycling ? Yeah . What was the other thing ? Backpacking . Backpacking . We , Yeah , I belong to a , a Boy Scout troop . It beats paying United Way . I just , you know -- Uh-huh . -- donate a whole bunch of my time to the Boy Scouts and have fun . Well , that 's , we have done that . Uh , our two older boys were in Boy Scouts and my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about a year ago -- Uh-huh . -- so we 've , uh , done a fair amount of that in our spare time , also . But , it , I , that 's a great thing to do , you know , really . Have you been backpacking anyplace exciting ? Uh , well , just last weekend went to Davy Crockett forest -- Oh . -- which is kind of out in east Texas . Uh-huh . And we go to , uh , places out in , uh , uh , let 's see what 's that , what 's that state north of us , 

that state -- Oh , that one . -- yeah . Yeah , that one . That one . Okay . Yeah , yeah . And , To the , uh , oh , by Fort Sill there ? 

Uh , no , to another f- , a , uh , old Indian fort that 's out there . Trying to think of the name of it . Durn . Well , yeah , no , sorry , no memory . Uh-huh . 

Have you gone , like to Fillmont with the Boy Scouts ? No , I missed out this last year . I was n't able to get the time off , but maybe next year . It 's a good possibility . I 've always thought that would be a real fun thing to do . Oh , yeah , yeah . When I was a kid , uh , we 'd do the equivalent thing in the High Sierras . That was loads of fun . Uh-huh . Does , does your whole family like to do it , like you , you know , for a vacation you 'd go backpacking ? Uh , no , not quite because I 'm not a whole family . I 'm just me . Oh , okay . You just , oh , and , and you volunteer for the Boy Scouts , huh ? Oh , yeah , I rent my kids . Uh-huh . Well , s- , sometimes , uh , 

It 's better than , you know , owning on them and making payments on them , and , you know , things like that . Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea . Have , uh , you said you did it in the High Sierras . Uh , do you ever , you know , just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack ? Oh , yeah , yeah . 

Uh , not recently because , you know , like the Boy Scouts makes it so that I go like once a month , you know . Uh-huh . Someplace . But , uh , there 's , uh , some , some stuff that I want to do with like Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or something like that . So , you know , they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and -- Uh-huh . -- off you go . Which seems kind of reasonable because that means you do n't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you , which seems a , a , just a tad more relaxing . Well , I , probably , probably . That 's , uh , well , my , my other things that I like to do in my spare time , I 'm , I like swimming . Uh-huh . Which is in now . I 've done that and I , I also , when I like something , I usually try to figure out how to make money off of it .
