Okay , what do you think are some current trends in , uh , the way families spend time together , based on what you 've seen . Um , I , I think that it 's getting to where they 're not spending time together . Yeah . Um , I think , uh , like in my situation , today , on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together , my husband 's been off doing his thing all day today , and I 've been off doing my thing all day and I have n't seen him since eight o'clock this morning . Really . So , uh . Are you newly married , or , Um , two years . Yeah . Same , same situation here , I 've been married about ten months , so . Yeah , I can , I can , I know what you mean . 

It 's , it 's really hard , hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and , uh , you both have hobbies that are different . Yeah . you know , if you have hobbies that are the same , then , you know , you can enjoy your hobby together , but my husband and I have different hobbies . Is he a hunter and a fisher and all that . No , no , he 's a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector . . That 's we , that 's wild . Um , so he was off today , uh , looking at , at records . Uh-huh . So , uh , and I was off , you know , doing , you know , hou- , household type things . Yeah . You know , laundry and , um , did some shopping and stuff . 

Um , from the people I 've talked to , I do n't know if I should bring this into it , but , um , a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more , um , where they could manage their own schedule and , Uh-huh . uh , they could spend more time with their kids because they look back and , you know , they 're all like , um , kind of regretful , I think . Yeah , 

I , I think , I think that would be the ideal situation , I think that would be the ideal situation . I think that a lot of people , like in my case I , I do shift work . Uh-huh . I do n't , I do n't have that choice . Yeah , same here . Um , I have to be at work at , at X hour , you know , at just , at , at a certain hour and I ca n't , it 's not flexible . Yeah . Um , it , it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours and , and maybe after we decide to have kids I , I might find a job that has flexible hours . I woul- , I hope so anyway . Um , but I would , I do n't know . At T I , is that where you work ? Uh-huh . It 's really kind of sad , 

some of the people that I work with they , like when I worked on second shift , um , their paren- , their kids go to school during the day and then they would n't see them at night , Uh-huh . because they would be in , you know , at work and the kids are all ready in bed . And so it was kind of like , they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses . This relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends , or something , you know . Yeah . So it was really sad , jus- , you know that a lot of families , um , have to , well , you know , have to have dual income . A lot of people choose to , which is fine . Yeah . But , uh , you know , then the kids kind of suffer . Yeah , 

I , ideally , it wo , it would be nice to be able to just have , like , back in the old days , Uh-huh , huh . you know , back like whe , when I grew up , Yeah . you know , the , the mom stayed home , you know , and raised the kids . My mom did n't go back to work until I was in junior high school . Yeah . Um , so she was there pretty much all my , you know , formative years . Yeah . And that was nice and I liked that and I would hope that I would be able to give that to my kids . Uh . But I think with the way the future is , um , economy wise , I do n't think it 's going to be realistic . I know . Unfortunately , that 's probably true . Um , do you think s- , the , the parents spend quality time with their kids are do you think it 's more like watching T V and stuff like that , not really , uh ... I , yeah , I , I think that , I think very few spend quality time . I think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff , stuff like that . Yeah . I think that , um , uh , most , most kids that I see do n't really , they do n't really value quality time . Yeah it 's always that way unti- , until it 's too late . Until , until they 're older and then they look back . Yeah , it 's true , um . What 's , what are some other questions they have , MUMBLEx , I 'm not sure . I know my parents are growing up , I guess they never spent much time watching T V . In fact , I 've never seen my mom turn on the T V , we did n't really have one MUMBLEx . Oh really . Yeah , 

and , and they spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff , but , you know , my dad had his own business and it was easier for them to do that , but , I , I do n't know , it was , I guess I did n't realize what a luxury it was at the time . 

I , I think kids now a days are raised on T V . I mean that 's , that 's almost like a surog , Yeah . T V -s a surrogate parent . Yeah , that 's a good way to put it . And not a , and not a very good one at that . Yeah , that 's a pretty good way to put it . 

If I had kids , well if you had kids , what kind of things do you hope to do ? . Um , I , I hope to , of course , be able to teach them right from wrong . I hope , I hope to be able to spend , um , their growing up years , being in the home , you know , not having to work . Yeah . Um , and being able to do , I , I , I know a lot of people wh , who , um , um , I work part-time also , and I a lot of people that I work for are , mothers that stay home . Uh-huh . Um , and they , they do a lot of volunteer work and they 're real active in the community and , um , they do a lot of things with their kids that they would n't ordinarily be able to do if they were working . Uh-huh . And I 'd , I 'd like to be able to do that . I 'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids . 

Do volunteer work and , Yeah . be in clubs and stuff , yeah , I agree . I hope that happens , in my case . Yeah , but , I think that 's for the , the few and far between . I think that , uh , probably ninety percent of the , Yeah . of the , um parents out there are , are probably working parents . Yeah . Huh . And I , I do n't , I do n't really see that , that trend changing much , if anything , I think , I know . there 's going to be fewer and fewer , uh , single income families . Yeah , and what 's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids . Yeah . 

That may not necessarily be consistent with yours . Exactly . See I , I never , I do n't even know what day care is really all about because I , I never went to a day care center , Yeah . I never , I never had that kind of experience . Huh . I , well I do n't even think we had , 

I do n't even remember them being around when we were little . Yeah , I , I see , it seems like that 's , that 's a big trend , you know , in the last ten years . Day cares have , have , have popped up and become a lot more , um , a lot bigger part of , of the kids ' lives . Yeah . It 's like a home away from home for a lot of them . Sure , is , um , , well , . I guess we could ring this off since we , we 've exhausted all of our ideas , we seem to agree . Yeah , I , I think , yeah I think this is a good closing point . Yeah , so , Well it was really nice talking to you . Yeah , you too , I wish you the best . Thanks you too . Okay thanks . Uh , bye , bye-bye . Bye-bye .
