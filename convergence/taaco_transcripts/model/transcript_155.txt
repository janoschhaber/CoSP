Okay . All set . Do you want to start ? I can go ahead and start , 

Sure , go ahead . uh , in Dallas there 's definitely a crime problem , I know it 's , you know , worse in the larger cities . Um , it 's kind of a concern for me , in fact , at the moment I 'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment and , uh , it 's , I am single and female , you definitely are going to worry about the location , and , uh , you know , accessibility of people to be able to break in . I live on a third floor now , but , I , you know , I 'm real concerned that I , I do n't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that , and , the , um , 

Do they have many buildings that have security there ? Some buildings do , it depends on the location . The area I live in right now , is , is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we do n't have anything at all , no burglar alarms , no guards . Yeah , yeah , well I , I went to Dallas , uh , when I worked for T I in Abilene and , uh , I 'm a little familiar with the city area , Forest Lane and , you know , through that , off , off the freeway . Uh-huh . And , uh , it did n't seem like it was that congested in that , that part . You know because to me where we live out here in the north east , it , it 's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other , Uh-huh . and the cities are very populated with tenement housing , Uh-huh . where there are more than one family in a house . Um . And with the , uh , people that are coming into the country from other countries , not knowing the language and , uh , they- , they 're going to the big cities . It makes it very difficult . Uh-huh . It really does , and , and I 've seen the same thing that you 're talking about , uh , much more crime than ever before . Uh-huh . Drugs of course , uh , a big part of it I think . Uh-huh . And , uh , I do n't know , a lot of younger people , you know , into more violent crimes . Oh , yeah , yeah . Tha- , that , that 's really sad , you know , you got young boys or girls , that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and , no remorse , what so ever . Uh-huh . There 's a lot of that going on in Dallas , too . Yeah . Yeah , it 's really sad . It is and , and I do n't know if it 's , uh , the family , you know , thing where they 're not bonding anymore , where mothers are working all the time and , Uh-huh , the kids are n't getting the attention that they need , or the television . Uh-huh . And I , I really think that we 're , we 're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people . Oh , I agree . I think that people are getting off too easy . They 're getting , they 're getting paroled too easily . 

Uh , uh . They 're just getting , uh , put on probation or something , because the prisons do n't have enough room so they get , they get lighter sentences , Yeah , exactly . and some of those people , they do n't deserve to be let loose . And , uh , you know , they had , uh , in fact on the news last night we were watching this , uh , man who lost his ten year old daughter . He ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone . Sh- , now ten years old , she 's old enough to be alone for a few minutes , you know . 

Oh , yeah . And while he was gone , he had looked , went looking for a job and stopped at the store , that 's what it was . And , uh , someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets , these two men , went in , raped the girl , murdered her , Oh my gosh . and the whole bit . And one of the men got , uh , I think it was seventeen years and the other one was in for , uh , life imprisonment . Uh-huh . The one that was in for the seventeen years , actually served seven , and he 's out . Uh , that 's terrible . And the man said , that , you know , if it were n't for the fact that he would go to jail , that he would eliminate this person himself . Uh-huh . And then go to McDonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing , think a thing about it . And I mean , I think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands . Yeah . And that innocent people , I , I should n't say innocent , because I mean , ac- , actually if they commit a crime that they 're in the same circumstances but , Uh-huh . the reasons that they 're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it , you know , it 's like two different things . Yeah . Sometimes when you lose someone that you really love , you do some crazy things yo- , I do n't know , Right , it 's a little more understandable under the circumstances , I guess . I , I like the idea that , uh , if someone is from a foreign country , Uh-huh . and they come to this country and uh , commit , a crime , I think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything , they should be immediately deported . Uh-huh . Especially if they 're found guilty of the crime . Uh-huh . You know , once they , they have been arrested and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt , these people are guilty . Uh-huh . That 's it , we do n't take care of them , we do n't support them , Uh-huh . nothing , I mean they go right back where they came from . Right , we have enough , enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is . So let , let their country take care of it . Exactly and , We do n't have , I guess too much trouble in Dallas with , well , I guess , I guess we do have a lot of people come in from Mexico , that cause problems , but , uh . But that 's , uh , the- , they 're , so close , I , I do n't consider Mexican people in the same category with , uh , Yeah . especially like , uh , people who come from cultures that do n't have the same , uh , kind of moral upbringing that we have . Uh-huh . Like you take Asian countries , or , uh , the Eastern countries where women are like in the foreground , Uh-huh . uh , in the background and the men are in the foreground , and it 's like , you know , Uh-huh . um , they live back in whe , where we came from two hundred years ago . Uh-huh . You know , whe- , we 've advanced beyond that , and I think that their , uh , mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing , you know what I mean . Uh-huh . It was amazing I went to the Far East , uh , back in October to do some training for T I and I , Uh-huh . uh , some of those countries were so safe , it was unreal . Singapore is very , supposed to be very safe and , in fact , Tokyo , and I thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people , Yeah . but they , at , at the T I there , I said is there any area I should avoid . And the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl , and said , can you think of any place where Dana should n't go by herself , or anything . And she , she thought for a few minutes and she said , no . And he said is there any place you would n't go by yourself . She said , no . And they said , Wow . it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway and somebody will turn it in and , and nothing will be missing . They said they can just about guarantee that there , that , that would happen if you did that . I thought , boy , in America , Wow . if you left a purse on a subway , you would never see it again . You better believe it , if , you would n't even have to leave it , I mean , Yeah , that 's true , it would get snatched right off your arm . that 's true . 

But I was thinking boy , in Dallas , if somebody asked me if there were places you would n't go by yourself at night , I 'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out . Oh sure . I mean , I could n't believe that she could n't think of any place . They said , the , apparently the crime , is , just , uh , That 's amazing , well , wh , what 's the difference there , do you know ? I 'm not sure what it is there . Now , I know what it is in Singapore , is they have the death penalty and they really enforce it , Oh , I , I believe in the death penalty , I really do . 

like for drugs , for drugs they , they enforce the death penalty for that . Uh , they 're just , very , very tough , and I guess maybe that 's the way Tokyo is too , or Japan is too . They 're just very tough on criminals . Yeah , yeah , I think that we 're too easy . Uh-huh . 

Uh , and we take the , the , uh , civil liberties , uh , stuff too far . Uh-huh . You know like people that are in prison , I mean we did n't put them there . They put themselves in that situation . Uh-huh , oh yeah . And as far as like them , uh , entertaining the rights that they should have . Uh-huh . I mean , we educate them , we feed them , we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they 're back in again . Uh-huh . I 'm not saying they 're all bad , but I think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes , Uh-huh . do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives . Right . I think that they should be put away . Right , and if they 're overcrowded , well , you know , Get rid of them . they should n't have gotten theirself there in the first place . Exactly . I , I really , I , I think that that 's the whole key here . This plea bargaining baloney , Uh-huh . where , uh , you know , they plead to a lesser crime , or , uh , they plead guilty in , or , you know , tell about someone else and they , they get less time , Uh-huh . Or , if they 're in there and they 've got seventeen years and they 're on good behavior , for every year they 're in they get so many less , you know , that they do n't serve the full penalty . Uh-huh . I , I , I really think we 're going to far overboard with all of this . Oh , yeah , I agree , because it 's not fair to those of us that , that deserve a safe , you know , life to have to , Yeah , 

same with drunk drivers . Right . I think it 's too easy for them . Uh-huh . That if the , the laws , and , and were , were harsher and were enforced , Uh-huh . I mean you have to set an example . You have to start somewhere . Uh-huh . And I think that people know that they 're going to get a slap on the wrist , they might serve a little bit of time and that they 'll be out on the street again . Uh-huh . An , it , an I feel bad for the policeman , Uh-huh . because he 's out there every day facing these people . Right . This , this craziness , you know , people with , uh , automatic weapons and , uh , all this other stuff and trying to do a job and let 's face it , what do they get paid . Right , not much . Twenty thousand dollars a year , if they 're lucky . I would n't do it for that . Yeah , huh-uh , and especially not in some of these big cities , like in Dallas I mean they 've had , 

they 're up in the top , top five I think of cities that are getting policeman killed on , on , in the line of duty and that 's really sad . It is , it really is . 

And I mean , they 're the first ones that take the brunt of everything . Uh-huh . You know , and I 'm not saying that they 're all good either , because there 's good and bad in everything , Uh-huh . but they , they 're already , uh , have str- , three strikes against them when they 're out there . Uh-huh . Because they 'll arrest someone and , you know , go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this , and having all kinds of evidence and you have to even be careful how you arrest them , how you talk to them , uh , you know , what they say ,
