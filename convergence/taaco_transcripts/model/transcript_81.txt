I do n't know . I grew up , uh , in the , the sixties , and at that time , uh , it was is a changing time for the whole music scene , I guess and I grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it I guess for several years after I graduated from college and , and thereafter but have since , uh , I grew up in a small town in , in southern Oklahoma I have kind of gone back to , uh , more of a county , uh , flavor in music . Um , I 'm not quite sure why that is and it seems like almost a opposite , but I guess I got away from what I consider to be the pot , uh , sounding music . It did n't have what , you know , I guess what I was looking for at the time country tells more of a , a story . It kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up and I 've , I 've become I guess more of a country fan over the years . When you say that you grew up , uh , in the sixties I take it that was the , uh , teenage type years 

or , uh , Yeah , that was my teenage years . I was born in fifty and , and , uh , Okay , we , we 're very similarly aged , so we probably have an in , interesting perspective on the music on the times , so I 'm just a couple years older than you , Yeah . um , essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that I , for one reason or another I did n't pay much attention to music , but as I look back now I realize it was very formative for me , uh , my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel , whom I saw perform when I was in college and I became attached to that style of , uh , urban , urban country if there is such a thing , Yeah . I think with , in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend , uh , to have a dramatic or story approach to their music , uh , usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it . Uh , over time I became very interested in , in baroque classical and I think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found it , it very relaxing for me . My tastes now run I guess to a upbeat , uh , Simon , Yeah . it 's something that interests me , uh , combined with , with the classical tastes I had mentioned . 

And my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds , early eighteen hundred music . I 'm not a music , um , MUMBLEx , I 'm not particularly schooled in it . I know what I like to listen to as far as classical music . And I , That 's kind of the way I am . 

I spent a good deal of time listening also to , uh , people from the late seventies , really , um , Neil Diamond , for instance . Um , people of , of that particular time , Uh-huh . I listen to some country and western but I 'm not sch , schooled in it and I , I 've enjoyed the times when I have listened to it . I played a little bit of piano . I continue to do that . I want to do it and I never have the discipline to stay with it , but when I do play , uh , and begin to reacquire skills I inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a , for a new piano player . It is , it 's got , uh , basically an easy , uh , rhythm and , and tone . Right . And it 's , it 's pretty , fairly well easily to uh , uh , something to fall into . 

I 'm kind of the say way , I , I 've gone through different periods of life , uh , in music from pop to classical . I guess one of the things was that influenced me was that I , I 've worked in radio stations as a D J for all my college years trying to support my way through there , and suppor- , was support , I was influenced by all different kinds of music but basically because that 's where I worked . And I 've developed a real love for , uh , classical music in , probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was , uh , heavy into classical type music . He said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music , uh , that they were using behind them because they used , especially Disney used a lot of classical music , uh , behind the cartoons and so consequently we wind up , wound up playing a lot of classical music there and I think that , uh , got deep seated into me . One of things I especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is , uh , are those that call on those classical , uh , roots , I guess , uh , Barry Manilow comes to mind for some reason there 's , there 's not a whole lot of his stuff that I 'm real crazy about , but he does have some things . Chicago had some things , Right . uh , and I think even Electric Light Orchestra had some , some real , um , influences by classical music and I 'm still , still , my favorite , in fact most of my C D -s are classical music . I find it very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy I particularly like the music . I do n't know which is chicken and egg in that situation . Uh , a good example would be , uh , 

I have connections but , but not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations , Uh-huh . uh , and I found that I really like CHINA BEACH and I particularly like TOUR OF DUTY and both of them , I had as much fascination of the background music , I think going on as I did to the theme of the shows , Yeah . uh , and I , I 've , uh , THIRTY SOMETHING I 'm particularly interested , but it 's the music , Yeah . almost that I find myself listening to , uh , 

I 'm kind of thinking that 's maybe , our generation was , uh , so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with , uh , things now with the music that 's behinds them . That could well be . I , I , uh , spent my junior year , uh , and sophomore and junior year in , in college when I , a song by the , uh , uh , 

I think the title of it was just Downtown , Uh-huh . uh , and if you recall how it goes downtown , Right . ta , da , da , da , uh , all I have to do is hear that song and I get strongly evoked memories of , of difficult times in school being behind on work , Uh-huh . uh , and my family now knows if they come into my study and , uh , I happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe I 'm trying to get a project done , uh , at school , uh , and I 'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away , That 's their signal . They can hear the unconscious music signal behind it , Yeah . that 's right . When did you first take your , uh , first piano lesson ? 

Uh , probably about first grade , Yeah . and I have , uh , returned about every four or five years to thinking that I would like to do something about it . I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes and then inevitably I am swept away by the , the pressure of other types of things , Yeah . uh , It is a time consumer . It is . In order to continue to , to grow and I , I always think that I 'll be able to do it and then I inevitably discover that I have no innate music talent relative to composition and that I struggle and really ca n't quite understand what is that other people take for granted , Yeah . in composition themes and I , keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them . I have a pretty good mathematical concept for what 's involved , Right . uh , but in a , in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude and I keep thinking , gee , I thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand but , but it does n't for me . No , 

it 's making that , that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it . I was never able to , to master all that . In fact my brother and sister both , they were , oh , thirteen , sixteen years older than I , they went through the , uh , parent thing where you 've got to practice or you 're not going out to play thing , and when it came to my turn the folks said no we 're not going through that again , they sold the piano , and is the turns out I was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to , so I , Uh-huh . that 's one of things I felt like I missed in life and I , I really , in fact , uh , one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin , that is played on , uh , piano . I just , you know , I can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time to do that , Oh , MUMBLEx , maybe one of these days , I 'll , you know , I 'm kind of like you , maybe one of these days I 'll get around to it , I 'll do something with the piano , but probably not . 

So we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance , uh , Just never got a chance to come out . No . That 's the most fascinating thing . Well , it 's a pleasure talking with you . And you , sir , Best , take care . of luck in your graduate school . Okay . Good-bye . Good-bye .
