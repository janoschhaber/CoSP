Uh , what i , what is your practice as far as budgeting ? Do you manage the money ? Well , I , we talk about it , 

but I 'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and , and tries to somehow make the ends meet , which , uh , Oh , I see . That 's how kind of I am , too . Are you married ? Um , yes . You are . Yes . I think the women for the most part end up managing the money . My husband always says he earns it , and I have to spend only what he earns . It , I do n't mind the spending , 

it 's just that trying to , trying to get what you need out of , out of what you have . That seems to be our challenge . Well , I do n't work outside of the home , 

and he always threatens that when I spend more than , what 's coming in , I have to go back to work -- I see . -- so I , I manage it . Well , I 'm , I 'm at home also , 

so , it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary , uh , Now , do you actually follow a budget ? Well , we pretty well do . Um , several years we did n't , and we found that we just were n't making the most of what we had , 

and so we , we , um , set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for , you know , just our bills . And then what 's left we divvy up . We try to save a little bit , although we 're not always successful , and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs . Well , that 's pretty much the way we do , um , or we did in the past , 

I would say . Uh , at this point our children are grown , and so I really do n't have the obligations there any more -- Yeah . -- that we have to balance to -- Right . -- you know , get things together for them , and I really just keep very good records , and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that , and -- Right . -- I try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I do n't always succeed at that . I usually keep one with a low interest rate , and I put things on there that I think I 'm not going to get to -- Right . -- and then I have another one , but for the most part , our mortgage and our utilities at this point , we 're in a new home , and , uh , they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to -- Yeah . -- so I 'm still getting used to that , but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we 're going to pay for it ahead -- Right . -- and we do not buy us , new cars . Uh , do you get into car , Well , we had new cars , um , always until about four years ago , my husband , um , owned his own company and it went under , 

and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment , and now it just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that , that we do have a used car , well , he has a company car also , but for our personal car we have a used car . Um , do you think that it 's wiser to buy used ? 

We do for us very much so . In fact , we are in a position that most of our friends why , wonder why we just do n't go to a new car , you know , whatever , and I said -- Right . -- look , you guys are all into car payments , we have n't had car payments for so many years , I love it this way , and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked and it has eighty-two thousand miles on it -- Uh-huh . -- and we were , kept saying , would n't it be great if we could find another one just like it . Believe it or not , we did , we found one , one newer -- Oh , no , -- the worst part is , it 's the same color -- Uh-huh . -- and so everybody 's saying , you 're kidding , you have two cars the same , and I said , you know how when you have a bad one , you say , never again -- That 's right . -- I said , well , we had one , and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it -- Wow . -- and it 's an eighty-five , and so I said , Hey , this was a cinch , we paid for the car , and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on . Right . This is for all the long running back and forth on , you know interstate driving and things , and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years , or next year probably . Do you , um , buy from dealers or from individuals ? Generally from dealers , and uh , it depends , because I do n't like to sell what we 're trading in to an individual -- Right . -- uh , unless we , we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell -- Right . -- you know , we were going up to a larger one , but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer , and we always make a deal . I mean , we have walked out of more dealerships saying , do n't bring us the manager , and all of that unless you want to bring him right away . You 're going to get one shot at us -- Yeah . -- we will , you know , and they say , Well , you 're kidding , you know . I s- , no , this is the price we 're going to give you out the door . We do n't want to hear about taxes ,
