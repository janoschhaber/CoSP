Yeah . Okay , so you enjoy camping ? Oh , yeah . Yeah . I , uh -- Uh-huh . 

-- like you , I have n't done any in quite some time -- Uh-huh . -- except for what I call living now -- Yeah . -- which is , which is very close to camping . Is it ? Uh-huh . Yeah . You know , I , uh , camped in the Boy Scouts and , you know , my dad and I went out sometimes but -- Uh-huh . -- uh , even my first , uh , eight or nine years of working , I camped almost all of the time because I was in construction . Uh-huh . And it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment -- Yeah . -- add to stress . I mean , when you have to have it , you have got to have it . Uh-huh . And , you know , in those those kinds of situations , uh , room rent which is outrageous . Uh-huh . Yeah . So , my buddy and I , we just camped . Uh-huh . And we figured , what the hell , we did it when we were kids and we loved it . Uh-huh . Of course , we did n't really rough it that much . When , when I was in high school , he is a couple years older than me and , uh , he graduated and went off to college and , uh , during the summer we would camp out at the lake . Uh-huh . But it was n't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove . Oh , well . Yeah . You know , I had a little boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine . Uh-huh . And , uh , well , it was fantastic . We would get up in the morning , go skiing , uh , that substituted for a shower -- Uh-huh -- and then we would go to work and uh , come back to the , uh , you know , boat house at night and , uh , in the afternoon , you know , it is still four o'clock . You have got four hours of day light , good skiing left . Uh-huh . And , uh , it was great . Yeah . But , uh , you know , now all my life is more like camping than not camping really . Uh-huh . Do you have electricity out there . Oh , yeah . Yeah . You 've got a phone obviously . Well , actually as a matter of fact , they just ran the phone three years ago . Uh-huh . We did n't have a phone . Uh-huh . They did n't have phone lines . You just could n't get phones . Yeah . And , uh , we are on the , we are third from the end on the electric string . Uh-huh . So , we are at the end of the mail route . Yeah . Like I said , we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas . Yeah , I guess so , huh . But , uh , you know , right now , uh , what we did , my wife and I , is we got a mobile home . Uh-huh . One of these twelve by forty-eight 's that got repoed , Uh-huh . And , uh , swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day , you know . Uh-huh . I 'm in construction and , uh , you know I just had this place you know to shower up while I was you know out here , you know , putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in you know . Uh-huh . And , uh , I came home from work one Friday afternoon and our truck was back . Everything we had was in boxes and my wife said , uh , we 're moving . Uh . And I said where . And she said out to the trailer . And I said , oh . She said yep and I said okay . Uh . So , we have been roughing it out here for about three years , but it is not bad . I , we have color T V , microwave you know -- Yeah . -- it is not horrible , but it 's , it 's a lot like camping . Uh-huh . Yeah , well I grew up in California , in southe , -- Uh-huh . -- in central California -- Uh-huh . -- right in the valley . So it is a forty-five minute drive to the mountains and , uh , so my dad loved fishing and camping . So we would go up . 

First , we went up just to , uh , with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our , uh , hot dogs by the fire or whatever . Sure . But then later my mom and dad got a camper so , uh -- Became civilized . -- we have kind of moved up . Yeah . A little bit in the world . Yeah , 

my mom goes camping you know . She takes her , uh , motor home . You know , she 's got one of these huge Winnebago 's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning , color T V , microwave oven -- Yeah . -- you know . She just , roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower . Yeah . You know . But , you know , she has a lot of fun . Uh-huh . And mostly , it is just a way to , she , she goes to dog shows . Uh-huh . See , she shows dogs and , uh , you can sneak a dog into a motel -- Uh-huh . -- but you ca n't sneak ten dogs into a motel . No . So , she , uh , you know , takes the motor home . And she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing . Uh-huh . And she , if he would buy her a motor home . So he did . But as far as camping , my wife and I have plans to , uh , not really camp per se , but to drive up the , uh , you know , Highway One there in California -- Uh-huh . -- uh , as soon as we get this house finished . Yeah . Oh that 's , uh , I am going to need a vacation . That will be pretty . That 's really pretty out there . There are a lot of nice places ,
