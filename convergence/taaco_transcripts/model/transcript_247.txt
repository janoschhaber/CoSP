Where are you from Tina ? Um , I 'm from Maryland and , um , I have one son who 's almost sixteen months old . Are , are you married , or ... Yeah , uh-huh . You are . 

I have , I have two children , I have a seven year old and a three year old . Oh . And , uh , so I try to spend as much time as possible with them . That 's good . Uh , what kind of things do you do ? Well , um , w- , we do a lot of things with them , you know , Ta- , Taylor my youngest is , or my oldest is in school and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that . Oh . Ho- , was it a big change in your life , to , uh -- Oh yeah . -- have a child . Um , yeah , it 's really nice , uh , 

my husband , uh , is working mo , you know , most of the time . He 's working long hours , but , uh , Uh-huh . I 'm staying home . Uh-huh . Uh , I 'm just working a couple days a month , and , um ... Oh , uh-huh . 

What do you do during those , those days ? Um , we spend a lot of time at the playground and we go to the zoo , and we go and we wa- , ... 

Well you said , you said you worked a couple days a month , though , Yeah , yeah . what do , what do you do ? I 'm a nurse . Oh , are you ? So , yeah , so it 's , it 's , it 's real easy to work out my schedule , Uh-huh . you know , to , uh , get in , to , to still stay in with that , Yeah . an , and to have enough time to spend with Matthew . Yeah . He , he 's , uh , just now really starting to , to get interested in a lot of things , so , um , Yeah , 

I understand that , yeah . They really grow up quick . Especially at that early age . Yeah . But my , my wife was , uh , she worked part-time when my oldest was , was little and now she 's staying home all the time , but , uh , that worked out really well because it 's a big transition I think to have children . 

Oh , yeah . You know , to go from , you know , nothing , you know , if you want to do something every night that 's fine , but when you have children it does n't work that way anymore , so . That 's right , and I think a lot of people are , um , are turning to , well , I think , I think a lot of people are realizing that but still there are so many people that are , you know , have their careers first and , -- Yeah , yeah . -- it 's , uh , I think it 's really hurting , uh , the kids , you know , but . Yeah , 

I agree with you , I , I , I think that my wife leaned that way and I 'm really glad she did and , you know , I 'm glad she 's staying home , but , you know , I know there are some days when she wi- , I know , . -- she wishes she was back at work . That 's why I like to to , to work a couple days , I think it 's , uh , Yeah . it gives me a break . Yeah , 

well t- , see that 's , that 's why I 'm glad my wife did too , 'cause she worked either two to thre- , three days a week and that got her out of the house and yet she 'd get to spend , you know , three or four days with ... Most of the time at home , yeah . Yeah , yeah , 

and so . Uh , we had started out like that and , um , I think that was really ideal , uh . Yeah , I do to , I agree , 

but then when you start having two of them , it 's , you know , a little bit tougher , It 's , yeah . because you 've got to make a little more money , to make that payoff and stuff . Yeah , yeah , it 's difficult , but . Are , are you from the Maryland area ? Uh-huh , I 'm , I 've , I 've lived here forever , so . Really . Yeah , I me- , I live in Germantown , and , uh . Are you , where are you from ? Um , uh , I 'm in Dallas , Texas . In Dallas , oh . Yeah , so , uh , I 'm , I 've lived here like eight years or so , my wife 's from Fort Worth . Oh , yea- . But , yeah , I work for Texas Instruments . Okay , oh , so that explains . Yeah , that explains it does n't it . . Well , um , I do n't know , I , uh , we , we do a lot of things on the weekends together , the family , Yeah , yeah . but , uh , as far as during the week , it 's , it 's usually , uh , you know , just my son and I , and we 're ... Yeah , what 's your husband do ? Uh , he , he works for Coca Cola . Uh-huh . So he , uh , he manages a plant out here , Oh . an , and it takes a lot of time . Oh , yeah , I 'm sure it does . But , um , it , you know , 

we take walks , Uh-huh . and go to the library , Yeah . and try to fill our day with things like that , but , um . Yeah , what , uh , 

my wife did some teaching at like , uh , like a private tutoring place . Oh . A Sylvan Learning Center this year and so that , that got me to sp , to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff , Oh . you know , 'cause normally if , if they need something they just go to mom . Yeah . No matter what it is , I mean , I cou , I 'm perfectly capable of doing it for them , but , Right . it 's so much easier to go to mom , I guess they get used to it . So , but , you know , we 'd go to the library and do things like that , yeah , but . That 's good , that 's good . I know my husband was real , uh , in the beginning when he , uh , he was transferred to a , a larger plant and he , uh , he works about an hour and a half away from here , from our home , Uh-huh . and , uh , so it takes him a little bit of time . 

Oh , yeah . And I 'm not able to work during the week , uh , because of that . He was , I was working in the evening , Uh-huh . and he was coming home and I , I could go to work , but , uh , Yeah . their relationship , uh , when I was able to work in the evenings , uh , really grew . Uh-huh . He , you know , just the time that they were spending together , Yeah . I think it , it really , it really helped to have that time together . Uh-huh , it really does because I think yu- , you know , you grow closer . Was your , uh , was your husband , I mean naturally a child , I mean ha , had he been around children , or ... Uh , oh yeah , he has , uh , he has seven other brothers and sisters , Oh . and they have , we have thirteen grand , well his parents have thirteen grandchildren . Uh-huh . So it 's , uh , you know , there 's a lot of kids in the family and , and he really enjoys it . Yeah , yeah . But , uh , right now it 's kind of a difficult time , but ... Yeah . And , and the cost of living here is just so tremendously , you know , outrageous . Yeah , yeah . Um , it 's difficult , uh , to do it any other way . Yeah , I understand . Yeah . I 'm , I , you know it 's , it 's hard because , you know , 

then you 're not getting to spend as much time with , at home , I mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he 'd want to . That 's right . So , yeah , that that 's a tough situation , but then , then again , you know , some , you got to do what you got to do , Yeah . you know to get along , too , so . Yeah , yeah , at least , I , I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home . It , uh , Uh-huh , we- , well like I said my wife normally feels that way , there are days when , uh , I come home and she says here take these kids , I 'm getting out . I know . So she 's , she 's had about enough during those days , but . I know . But , for the most part , I , you know , I 've really feel like that 's led , the way that , you know , we- , jus- , like what you said with the cost of living and everything , I think a lot of people ca n't afford to get by on just one salary an -- Yeah . -- and wo n't . Yeah . And so I think that 's le- , tended to lead to a decline in , in families and family values especially . Oh yeah , it has . And I really think that that 's one of the problems the nation 's facing that , you know , we need to do something about , but I do n't know what . I believe that too , 

and I think , uh , the kids are where they need to , you know , Yeah . they need to really focus on the children in the wor- , in this country . Yeah . Would , would you have said that a couple of years ago , do you think ? No , 

I did n't , I did n't even really think about it that much , I mean , you know , Uh-huh . I , I was aware , vaguely aware of it , but , um , I did n't it was n't really that important to me , and , uh , ... Uh-huh , it 's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you 've had a child . Oh , it , it really does , I , just the whole , uh , you know , seeing how you really are cre- , are , are forming this , Uh-huh . 

you know , the mind . Well , you know , in the next year or so , you 'll see so many instances where , you know , he 'll mimic something that you 've done , and you see , you know , everything I 'm doing , he 's learning from . That 's right . 

And , and , you think , if I was n't here he 'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care . Yeah . You know , th- , that 's how they 're developing their patterns . And I think a lot of people either , do n't care , or do n't realize it , you know . That 's , 

Or , or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide . Yeah . I , I 've seen a lot of people just say well , you know , he 'll learn everything when he gets into , Yeah eventually . uh , you know , Yeah , it 's true . 

but it , um , I , I know , even just this first year , that I 've been with , uh , my son , h- , here , um , he 's , I can just see how much , Uh-huh , of , of a difference it makes staying home with him , Yeah . instead of , uh , MUMBLEx , Yeah , 

plus , plus I think it becomes part of y- , part of you too , I mean , you get to stay home , I mean it 's not just for him , but it 's also for you , because you 're both kind of bonding together there too , I think , so . Yeah , that 's true . Well it 's been nice talking to you . 

Well it 's nice talking to you , too . Okay good luck . Okay . Okay , good-bye .
