Okay well , There we are . All right . Um , um , well , uh , tell me about the car that you 've got . Well , I have a Honda , um , hatchback , nineteen eighty-four . Uh-huh . And I had a hatchback , a nineteen seventy-eight version before this one . Uh-huh . And , uh , I 'll be honest with you . I have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and , and , uh , put together 

and it , it does its job . All I have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty-five hundred miles , and I , I did have to put two , two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles , but that car just purrs like the day it was built . I get forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and uh , twen- , twenty-eight to thirty driving around in town . It 's a five speed straight stick machine . Uh-huh . And , I can carry more in that , uh , that trunk area in my little Honda than I can in the big cars , and I have a large , um , Pontiac , and I have a sixty-nine Cougar , which really is , I 'm saving because it 's , it 's old , but it 's in beautiful shape . Uh-huh . But I can carry as much in my Honda or more than I can in , in those other bigger cars . Well , that 's very interesting . I 've had , I 've had exactly the same experience with the one that I 've got . It 's a , and surprisingly it 's also an eighty-four -- Oh , oh . -- and , uh , L X ? Yeah , I 'm still here . Um , I 'm sorry what ? It was an L X ? Yes , it 's an L X , it 's not a hatchback , but it 's , um , it 's , uh , Uh-huh , yours is a four door . Four door , yeah -- Uh-huh . -- and very , very comfortable car . Big roomy trunk -- Yeah . -- uh , and , uh , and very happy with it , 

and I must admit it 's , you know , if , if , if , uh , my only consideration were , were , you know , buying another car just to tool around town in and make , you know , brief trips and things like that , I would very , very seriously consider buying one . Uh , I think they 're extraordinarily reliable cars . Yes , they are . Um , my , my real concern with , uh , uh , why I 'm not sure I want to buy a Honda , is because I have to make a kind of a , a steady , um , trip down the road about once a month , because I 'm divorced and I have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina -- Um , uh-huh . -- and , uh , I drive ,  down Interstate Ninety-five , and it 's just an absolutely wild highway . Ninety-five is wild in any car . There 's no doubt about that -- Yeah and , 

-- because I , I , I run over to Crystal City , or used to , I 'm retiring the end of this month -- Uh-huh . -- but I 'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there . And , you , well , you 've got it , and , uh , so having precious cargo in the car with me , as you can well imagine , it 's very hard for me to imagine that , that , uh , a Honda 's going to be as safe a car as , as the one that I 've got my eye on , which is a Volvo . Uh-huh , uh-huh . In , in fact , quite frankly I 've owned a Volvo in the past , and -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I 've , I 've , 

they 're expensive cars to keep up when they need service , but , uh , I 've found that I 've had a lot of luck with them . Uh , course I 'm a mechanically inclined kind of person , and I always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that , you know , need to be taken care of , and so forth . And I guess that 's one thing that , that recommends the Honda to a lot of people , is is there 's just very little that you have to do under the hood , and , uh , Yes , it just , just sits there and purrs , 

and you , all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter . I get six hundred miles on a tank of gas . Oh , I know . It 's really amazing . Yeah . It 's , uh , , Beautiful , beautiful machine . Absolutely ,  incredible . So , um , yeah , 

anyway , I 've been looking at the prices of these cars and , and so forth , and I think that it 's , it 's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you 're -- Is that right , uh-huh . -- willing to buy ones that are about ,  the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own -- Uh-huh . -- and , um , Well , a brand new Volvo costs , what , thirty thousand dollars ? Well , certainly some of the top end ones . You can still get , get , uh , even the , the low end wagons , um , for less than twenty thousand dollars -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , we get , you know , in the Washington area , of course , being as affluent as it is , there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here -- Um , uh-huh . -- so there 're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any , any week , and I sort of , you know , scan the paper and look at them , and so forth and -- Yeah . -- so , um , anyway , and that 's , that 's the other thing is that I 've , I 've never really been too terribly much of a new car person . I think I 've bought one or two new cars in my life , and I 've tended to , um , to , uh , buy cars that are , you know , two or three , and sometimes even four and five or six years old . This Honda that I have I bought used , and , in fact , it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it . I 've just rolled seventy thousand miles , and it 's a seventy-four , I mean , an eighty-four . So . Well , my , my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it -- Yeah . -- and I 've made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach , Virginia , where my mother lives , and things like that , and I drive it ,
