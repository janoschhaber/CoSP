Hello . Hello there . Did I reach the Dallas area ? I beg your pardon ? Did I reach the Dallas area ? No , 

you 've reached Dayton , Ohio . Dayton , Ohio , I 'm from North Carolina . Oh , you 're from North Carolina . Where in North Carolina ? 

In Raleigh . Raleigh , great . Yeah , Well , my name 's Mary . My name is Fernando . Fernando , glad to know you . So , um , do you , well , how 'd you find out about this ? Uh , I was visiting my son down in Dallas , and . Oh , okay , he works for T I . No , no , but his wife has a contract with T I , and that 's how we learned about it , uh-huh . Oh , okay , because I 'm down at N C State . Yeah , uh-huh . And so I took a class , and he said , sign up and get some money -- Right . -- and just talk for five minutes . So are you ready ? I 'm ready . Okay , 

let 's get started . All right , okay . Okay , so , uh , what do you think , that , uh , what do , what do , what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America ? Oh , if I knew that I 'd be a very wealthy person . Yeah , 

but what , what , what are the steps ? Well , you have to see , I , the way I look at it , you have to think first of all why , or ha , has crime increased , and if so , why has crime increased ? Well , see the problem is , is that , um , what happens is as , that you 're , uh , you know , as you go from the country to a city , crime always increases , right ? Uh-huh . Because in the country , people still respect , uh , the property of other people . Right . And so , as , as , and the people in the country do n't want as much as the people in the city . Uh-huh . Now what happens is all those that do n't have any money in the country move to the cities , and they rush to get the same thing . They say , why ca n't we have the same things that these other people have , and the thing that we can do is , we need money for drugs , and what we have to do is , we have to go , uh , get some stuff , steal it , and then , you know , just resell it . It 's easy , you said the magic word there . Which one ? Drugs . Yeah . And that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased . That 's , uh , that 's , uh , the main reason I think , uh , everywhere because , uh , you have deaths . I mean , I mean , you have murders and you have , you know , people stealing other people 's stuff , and that 's a lot of it has to do with drugs . 

Oh , yes . It does n't have to do , I mean , the thing is is that , you know , it 's like you might be standing somewhere , right , and like let 's say you , you 're , you 're , you know , you 're driving out and you 're driving back home and it 's late at night . And you stop by one of these , you know , twenty-four hour , you know , gas stations joints . Yeah . And , uh , somebody walks in there with a gun . I mean , they 're going to want the money , and you can tell by the people who are always caught , that these people are there to get money for drugs . I mean , they do n't want the money so , uh , so they can do something else with it . No , 

they do n't want the money for food , that 's for sure . Right , right , and so . Well , but you know , the , the strange thing , uh , perhaps , not strange , but something that many people do n't realize , is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids , because , uh , I 'm a retired educator . Okay . And , in fifty-one and fifty-two , the police came to the high school where I was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs , how to recognize the pushers -- Yeah . -- outside the one entrance , that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started , and so on , and so on . So it 's a problem that 's been around for over forty years , and we 're just really , uh , uh , now , trying to , uh , figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge . Yeah , there 's a , there 's a , uh , a song that I know which says , you know , tha- , it 's like , in , uh , nineteen eighty-eight , nineteen eighty-nine , the local , state , and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America , and , uh , their figures , I think are too , so 

I mean it 's like , compared to , you know , compared to , weapons or stuff like that , I mean , you 're spending nothing on , on crime in the country itself . What you 're doing is , you , you know , it 's like , you have other things , you know , you have the AIDS we 're going to solve , try to solve -- Uh-huh . -- the AIDS problem while , while , you know , some people are getting killed here and there and then . Yeah and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers , the big dealers in drugs , Uh-huh . may be , may be part of the power structure that 's keeping us from spending the money in that direction . But those people never get caught . The people that -- 

That 's right , they 'll never get caught . -- that , that I , 

see , their theory is that if I 'm surrounded , and I 'm going to be caught , I 'm going to try to find my way through , and they 're not going to take me alive . Uh-huh . But I have such a big army outside of my place , that nobody can touch me . That 's right . But they 'll , You know , it 's like , of course , I mean I might be , you know , the the leading drug dealer here , but you wo n't find me dealing in drugs , I mean , there 's no connection -- That 's right . -- between me and the people that were caught , you know . That 's right , and , they , one person does n't know the other person down the line . Right . 

But the guy at the very top , the one who 's , who 's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure , uh , the , uh , and had the political -- Yeah . -- uh , pull to keep things from , uh , keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction , other than on the drug dealing , because it sure is monstrous in this country . Yeah , I was , I was at a , at a party on Saturday , and this guy comes over , he goes , hey , how you doing , MUMBLEx he started talking to me , and this guy was from Jamaica , right . Uh-huh . And he 's got his little brother selling drugs . Uh-huh . You know , and he goes , yeah , I just came up here to work , and I go , oh you did , MUMBLEx you make very good money up here . He goes , yeah , I make a lot , a lot of money , he goes , you know . And , uh , in the movie GOOD FELLOWS . Yeah , might . Did you see it ? Nope , I only heard about it . Okay , in one part , the guy goes out of jail , and within , uh , two months , he has all his house payments gone -- Uh-huh . 

-- everything paid , you know , and he had enough money to , you know , it 's like , those guys , at one point , you know , they had so much money that they did n't know what to do with it . Yeah , really , you know , even in our prison systems they 're finding that they 're , they 're having drugs smuggled into them . Yeah , yeah , 

that 's , that , that was also in the movie . Right . Yeah . So hello Mary . Been nice talking with you . We 've been talking for five minutes ? 

I beg your , we 've been talking for a little bit . I appreciate the call . I enjoyed talking with you . All right , okay , same here . Uh-huh , bye-bye . Bye-bye .
