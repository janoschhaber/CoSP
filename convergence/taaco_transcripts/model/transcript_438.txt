Up , up there , maybe , maybe you guys do n't have as , uh , big a problem with air pollution as many , do you ? We , we , we have a terrible air pollution problem . Do you really ? 

Our summers are extremely , uh , hazardous -- Uh-huh . -- and during , uh , certain wind directions because we get the , uh , Gary , Indiana -- Uh-huh . -- Chicago pollution -- Uh-huh . -- and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze , uh -- That 's horrible . -- coming up along the lake . Uh-huh . And they do post , uh , uh , warnings for people who have , uh , heart diseases or respiratory problems -- Uh-huh . -- during that summer season . In the winter it 's not as severe . Right . But , uh , if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad . Uh-huh . Uh , the State of Wisconsin , as a matter of fact , uh , started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting . Uh-huh . Uh , I do n't think it 's going to go very far , but it , it was , uh , a way of , uh , triggering , uh , awareness . Right , right . So what 's the conditions like in Dallas ? Well , uh , in Dallas , I , I have n't seen air pollution quite on a , quite on a level that we had in Denver . I grew up in Denver , and , and I 've lived there most of my life , 

and we used to have those , uh , you know , the posted warning days . Uh , however , in Colorado now , they have the emissions control law , which has really cut down , probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to po , post warnings now , you know , as far as health concerns . Um . Uh , due to that emi- , the , the emissions , uh , uh , control on the vehicles , seems that all of our , all of our , uh , smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry . Wisconsin has a , a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag -- Uh-huh . -- and they are tested for , uh , their pollution control equipment , 

and if they do n't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it , it is drivable . Um . So , they 've , they 've tried to do a lot of that -- Uh-huh . -- and I thi , you know , there seem to be , at least in certain little pockets , and we were talking earlier about Madison -- Uh-huh . -- Madison has one of the nicest , uh , bike , uh , road , uh , sharing programs of , of any city in Wisconsin -- Oh , really . -- and all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of , uh , bike trails for recreational use -- Uh-huh . -- of any of the states . Uh-huh . And there is a , a real promotion of , of biking -- Uh-huh . -- but , um , there are still a lot of people who insist on , on driving their own automobiles -- Right . -- uh , to go everywhere . I find that a little irritating , because -- Uh-huh . -- I do n't think it 's always so necessary . Yeah , yeah , it , it becomes , uh , maybe to you and I who have grown up in some in , uh , uh , some more beautiful parts of the country , uh , I think that , that , uh , we become a little more aware , uh , rather quickly of , of what 's happening with air pollution and how , uh , how horrible it really is . Um , I , I notice people in , in Dallas seem to say , Well , sure , there 's air pollution , but , you know , really , how bad is , how bad could this problem really be . 

Send , send them to Wisconsin , and we 'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes -- Oh really . -- and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from , uh , the , uh , acid rain -- Uh-huh . -- and -- Uh-huh . -- they 'll , they 'll , they may wake up , you know , how 'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour -- Right . -- because of acid rain . Right . It 's , uh , really a serious issue for those of us up in this , uh , sector up , up here . Do you find that , um , or , or do you hypothesize that , that most of the , uh , smog or , or air pollution comes from vehicles or does it come mostly from industry up there ? I think it 's mostly vehicles -- Yeah . -- although it does come from some of the industry of , of the Gary area -- Uh-huh . Uh-huh . -- that causes the acid rain . That I 'm a little uncertain of , but -- Uh-huh . -- I do know that , uh , it is a problem . Uh-huh . I had talked with my parents . I , I grew up , uh , I was born in , uh , Muncie , Indiana , and , and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute , and I had asked them before , uh , I went back to visit recently , about a year ago , and I asked them , I said , did you ever realize the air pollution that was ,
