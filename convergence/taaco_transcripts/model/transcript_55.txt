Okay . Um , what do you do this weekend ? Well , uh , pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard . Huh . Which is , wh- , d- , what do you plan , have planned for your yard ? Well , uh , we just bought our house , uh , last July , and it 's , it , it , the house is forty years old so there 's , there 's an established lawn and whatnot , flower beds , things like that , but they 've , uh , they 've gone a few years of neglect . Uh-huh . 

So , we 're in the process of , uh , revitalizing the whole situation . We 've got , um , different flower beds in front and , uh , a window box , a built in window box , um , trying to get some color back in those , get the trees trimmed up , uh , get rid of a few weed problems and things like that . Huh . So , What part of the state do you live in ? Uh , I live in Dallas . Oh , okay . Okay . My wife and I , we live in Dallas too , so . Okay . Yeah , just what that area , we 're planning on moving to Flower Mound , and we 're going to be getting some wheel h- , we 're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there . Yeah . Seems like it . 

Uh , the place we 've been living at , it 's , uh , we 're , we 're just leasing it . The , in Plano , and the soil has so much , has such a high clay content , Uh-huh . that , uh , uh , I went to use my dad-in-law 's tiller and it about for my arms off , I 'll bet . sockets . I 'll bet . I mean just , just scratching two or three inches was just a chore . 

It was , it was and then when it gets wet , you know , you do n't even want to get out in the yard , Right . it 's horrible . Right . It 's a nightmare . But , um , I do n't know what , what i- , um , where you live is there a real high , uh , alkaline or ash content or , Yeah , it 's pretty high alk , w- , ac- , actually it 's done , uh , it 's in the north end of Oak Cliff in , uh , Kessler Park area , Yeah , yeah . and , uh , we 've got about , I know right where that 's at . yeah , we 've , we 've got mayb- , maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil , Uh-huh . and then it 's solid rock from then on down , so . Really . Yeah , it 's , uh , a little aggravating , , 

we ca n't , we ca n't put in anything too big , um , as far as , uh , shrubs and things like that because they 've got to get a chance to find the , find the cracks in the rock . Golly . But , uh , Is it , is it limestone under , underneath ? Yeah , it is . It 's , it 's solid limestone . How do you put trees in there ? 

Uh , you just , we 're just happy that there 's trees already there so far , Huh . um , anything like that is , is a , uh , major undertaking I guess , uh , sprinkler systems or anything , uh , start to get real expensive because there 's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock . But , uh , and it , you know , no- , , not even , consider , considering a pool or anything like that , that 's , that 's , Oh . practically has to be blasted in I guess . But , uh , and it makes , it makes for a , a different challenge , I 've never , well , I , I moved to Dallas about five years ago , Yeah . and , uh , I never really , messed with anything , uh , gardening or anything like that until now , but , uh , I , I keep hearing all the stories of , of different parts of town . In fact , uh , we even , we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that , Uh-huh . and the first thing the , the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said , uh , I 've got , I 've got a dozen different varieties and each one works in one part of town and that 's it , That 's basically what he was trying to tell us . Yeah . 

Oh , yeah , we , we tried planting tomatoes last year and it , they , they turned out pretty poor . Yeah . I just , I wi- , I just wish I 'd known the , , the variety and everything . Yeah it , But it , it 's amazing we also have roses , and , I mean , they just grow so beautifully . Yeah , that wou , in fact , we put in some , uh , some more roses yesterday . Like what , um , what type roses ? Uh , different , uh , a few different , uh , hybrid tea type varieties . Oh , hybrid teas . Yeah . Yeah , we , we have a few , uh , of the real short stem . They 're kin- , they 're kind of like the bush roses . Okay . But , uh , I do n't know I think it 's , I think it only has about five or six more years to go because it 's a , it 's a really old bush , Yeah . and but I , I , I 'm amazed because the sun is so intense , and the roses just seem to survive just fine there . Yeah , that 's , we , that 's what we 're searching , uh , we 've got , we 've got all the different lake editions around the house and we 're , we 're kind of experimenting right now . Uh-huh . We do , we 've got the direct sun in front 

and the backyard has two great big , uh , spruce and , and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall so the backyard is just complete dark all day long . Huh . And , uh , we 're , we 're struggling to find something for those areas . Yeah . Have you , have you , uh , done , um , done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not ? No , they 're , they 're in pretty good condition . Yeah . Uh , we 've been , we 've been pretty lucky on that . Yeah , 

just if you want a lot of , you know , light for underneath , Uh-huh . that may be the , all right because we had , because we have some , we have some old fruit trees . We have a plum that 's just about ready to go , Uh-huh . so we may just be getting rid of that but , but our peaches they , they seem to be doing just fine , but they , they really need pruning . Yeah . It just seems like they , that , that even , you know , pruning once a year is really not enough but the , the way they behave . 

That 's true . That 's true . I do n't know . But , uh , but , uh , what kind of , uh , what kind of , what kind of grass are you growing ? It 's , uh , bermuda . Bermuda . Yeah . Yeah . Oh , I 've , I 've been trying , uh , uh , a mixture of , uh , the bermuda and the rye , Okay . but I may be working like a fescue in because of , you know , the type of weather . It seems that , uh , bermuda 's , bermuda 's fine but , um , it looks like it would hold the soil 

but it really does n't . Right . A lot of , a lot silt that comes in it just does n't seem to hold it very well . Yeah . But , uh , but the rye does really well . Especially during the wintertime . Okay . But , uh , but , boy , once it gets over seventy , seventy-five degrees that , it just dries up , Uh-huh . shrivels up and dies . But anyway . Yeah , it 's , uh , there 's such a , there 's such a difference , Yeah . 

through the year . Uh , My , my parents-in-law they 're , they 're building a house into the side of a hill , um , well , it 's already been built and everything . Uh-huh . They 've been living there for about three months now , but , uh , this is out in west Texas , Uh-huh . but the , the wind there , has been so bad that , I mean , they 've tried to plant grass and they just , , have some problems , that 's it . 

big time problems they just , Yeah . so they just washing , uh , watching their lawn just blow away . But it 's , it 's quite an undertaking . They have about two or three acres of land on lake front property , 

Oh , wow . on a , on the side of a hill . It 's beautiful , I mean , Uh-huh . you can see the house from , you know , miles away , but it 's , you know , it 's a pretty neat little job but , Yeah . they save a lot of , they save a lot of energy but just , uh , you know , for them , I mean , they , they 're going to have to start gardening . It 's going to be from the ground up . Yeah . The whole way . Yeah . And they said , well , we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just , , getting this property developed . It 's amazing , I mean , Yeah . they have , have the , all they have are me- , uh , mesquite and cottonwoods , Yeah . and , uh , it 's , it 's all on Lake Greenbelt , Okay . that property out there . And , uh , I do n't know , that what they have , they have all the water they want , Uh-huh . they can , they can actually , they can pump water , I mean , they have to get permission but they can pump water up from the shore , Okay . but , uh , that 's for like an additional , they have to pay like some kind of fee per year . Oh , okay . But , uh , they 're , uh , right now though I think they 're just , they 're trying to get the trees planted and everything . Sure . But , man , I , I just think of all of the money that they , that they 're going to have to spend just getting that . But the taxes alone there , Lake Greenbelt and some places , they , they , they really nail them for tax . Uh-huh . And , I mean , you 're talking what , just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes . Wow . It 's , it 's ridiculous . That really is , it , it would , 

it seem like it be just the opposite when you get , Yeah . No , no , it 's not it 's , because even though it 's far out there , it 's just that Lake Greenbelt , you know , they have to , they , they try to do it just from the , selling the water . Uh-huh . But , um , the water usage , you know , they try to limit , even though there 's three or four streams that flow into it , people still use it enough in , like in towns like Clarendon and other areas that , where they irrigate . Uh-huh . They , they , they still have n't gotten used to the dry land farming but , Yeah , that 's true that , the ir- , irrigation because it 's gotten so bad the past few years , but I do n't know I just came back from there and just the air is so dry . I do n't see how anything can survive out there , for long periods of time . Should say my father-in-law says the mesquite trees are , they 're , they 're pretty smart , they 're smart , they 're about the smartest tree around . They do n't , they do n't even start growing until May , Yeah , that 's true . May or April , like after it 's been raining for a few months . That 's true . They say the roots have developed so that 's all they work on . Just a leafy , they do n't do anything . Uh-huh . Yeah , 

that 's something I 've been , uh , been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are , Uh-huh . at this time of the year and , you know , we 're trying to decide what , what to , what to put on one side of the house and things like that , but there 's so many things that they , they last for just a couple of weeks and then it , then it 's just a , a bush there from then on . It 's kind of , it 's kind of disappointing . I , I do n't know 

my , my wife and I , we planted on the , on the south side of our , of our house we planted some gardenias . Uh-huh . And they did real fine during the summertime it 's just , but during the fall when it stopped , when , uh , the rain let off just a little bit it , I mean , it just dried up . Yeah . And , uh , so I guess , it , these plants they just , they do n't , it 's like they remain ...
