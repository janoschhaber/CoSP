Well , what 's your favorite baseball team , Rita ? Well , I suppose I 'm supposed to say the Rangers , right . Is that what I- , is the million dollar question here ? Well , that is n't a , a true false or right or wrong test here . Yeah . Uh , uh , you know , I would like to say the Rangers , but unfortunately they 're not . I was from Illinois , and my favorite team was the White Sox . Not a Cubbies fan , huh . No , no , my family , my dad was , but I turned out to be a White Sox fan . Well , that 's all right . I lived in Chicago . How do you expect them to do this year ? Yeah they did pretty well . Okay . What did you think of the World Series ? Well , I 'll tell you . I just , uh , moved down from South Dakota in July , and , uh , in South Dakota , the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where I was living -- Uh-huh . -- and so everybody was a Twins fan , and I was kind of , uh , did n't have much interest in the Twins , you know , it was , it was kind of pathetic , I mean , we only had two radio stations , and one of them broadcast every Twins game live , you know , and , and the other one was country . So you did n't really have a lot of choice , did you . So , that 's right . There 's was Twins there , or , you know -- Or country . 

-- Skip Williams . Yeah . Oh , uh , and I was routing for the Twins myself because , uh , they , a couple of Ranger players that I had watched when we first moved here , uh , went to Minnesota , and we used to tease about , my son and I used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to Minnesota , but it was int- , it certainly was an exciting Series , anyway . 

It sure was , it sure was . What do you think going to happen to the Rangers ? Well , I -- Or can we predict ? 

-- I would like to a , a , assume that they 're going to do , do better this coming year , I was sure hopeful anyway . When we moved down , uh , I was able to go to my first , you know baseball game , and -- Uh-huh . -- thought , this is great , this is incredible . So I became a Rangers fan . I did n't really have one in South Dakota . So I adopted the Rangers , or rather they adopted me , I guess -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , it was just exciting , you know , you can watch baseball on T V and they hit the long ball , and it looks like wow , they really hit that ball . But when you go to the ball park , it 's really not all that far -- No . -- you know , and it 's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you , and . Oh , is n't it though . You know , but , oh , I , I think going to the ball park just really makes it . Because then you watch it on T V you feel like you 're more a part of it too . That 's right , that 's right . Well , I 'm a great sports enthusiast , so I love , you know , baseball teams , and they , in fact , on the news tonight , Nolan Ryan was on there . He was being , he was put in the , which I never knew existed , the Restaurant Hall of Fame . The Restaurant Ha- , The Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight , and -- Huh . -- he , uh , says he 's coming back , you know , uh , 

he does n't know how many years -- Right . -- I mean , to pitch . He 'll be at least one more , and he said he 's been saying one more , and it 's been two and three , might be two and three more . He likes it . That 's right -- Yeah . 

-- and he 's still doing great -- That 's right . -- still doing excellent . You know , and he said , I get a kick out of it , you know , he 's , he 's such a nice man . Well , did n't he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers ? Yeah , 

and he , you know when he quits at being active , he will go into , you know -- Management . -- being a , managing and , yeah , you know , being a coach , I 'm sure . Right . But , he 's , uh , he certainly is a good example , uh , for the kids . That 's right . You know , you like to have someone like that you could point to say , see what a fine man , that , he is . You know , some of the , like , uh , Ivan Rodriguez was n't even born when , when , uh , Nolan Ryan started pitching . 

That 's right . And it 's just incredible to think that there 's , uh , there are players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against Nolan -- Uh-huh . -- or with Nolan , you know , and now their sons are . Oh , he 's been a legend for so many years , you know , and I do n't know , were you here , had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at U T with his son . His son pitched for U T and he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers . Uh-huh , I was n't . Yeah , it was a , 

I think it was a little early part of the summer , and uh , Was it Nolan against , uh -- Nolan against . -- Ryan against Ryan , huh . Ryan against Ryan , yeah , his son pitched for U T -- Well that is neat . 

-- and , uh , only , uh , Ryan did n't want too much publicity on it because he did n't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing . Uh-huh . A game is a game , you know . Well , the Rangers really , uh , knocked the socks off of them , which you would expect -- Right . -- you know , anyway , but Nolan I think took himself out after a couple of innings or something , you know , of the game so ,
