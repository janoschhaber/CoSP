Okay . You think you 're getting your money 's worth ? Uh , never . 

Uh , the only thing I 'm , I 'm thankful of is that we do n't have to pay any income tax in , in Texas . Well , that 's probably the next year 's agenda . Yeah . Boy , I tell you what , I sure hope they do n't pass something like that . Oh , yeah . 

They 're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around , and I , I think one way or the other , we 're going to pay for the bureaucracy , I guess . Uh , it 's one area that is really , I , I think hurting the economy more than anything . I think the taxes have just , every time you turn around they , they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products , and I , I , I think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now . Well , I , I tell you , um , 

I remember every time , it seems like , we turned around , they 're adding another nickel or -- That 's right . -- a few more cents onto the price of gasoline . That 's right . And actually , that one , the , the , the taxes on gasoline do n't , do n't bug me as much as , uh , uh , what are we , eight and a quarter percent sales tax ? Yep , that 's right . And every time you go to buy anything now , uh , even , you know , they , they tax food . That 's the one that really kind of bothers me . 

Well , I think that , uh , that the problem with the sales tax , of course , is it 's an unfair tax across the board , uh , as far as ability to pay , which a- , allegedly , allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards . But , uh , now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of , you know , taxes on everything they buy , and where people that make , you know , two hundred , three hundred thousand dollars a year , certainly a portion of that , they are n't going to be paying taxes on , you know . And , uh , that 's the unfair equity , inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue , but I do n't think it is anymore , not in Texas anyway . Oh , I got you , because people that , uh , do n't make very much money wind up spending it all . That 's right , that 's right . Yeah , whatever they spent it on , they have to pay tax on . That 's right , that 's right . And that 's the unfairness of the thing , but , uh , I think taxes generally are unfair so , 

Wha , what do you think of that new luxury car tax , anything over ten thou- , or thirty thousand dollars ? Well , you know , like other things , if they do n't affect you , you do n't worry about them too much . I have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still , so it does n't , I , I think , uh , you know , generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line , which is , uh , you know . Oh , sure . And , uh , I guess if people got thirty , forty thousand bucks to spend on a car , uh , that 's their prerogative , you know . I , I , I do n't have a whole of sympathy on that . You , maybe you buy that , you know , 

and I do n't mean to be knocking , uh , No , uh , no , I have n't , but it , it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax , uh , on top of it . And there 's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand . Yeah , 

there are , there are . And the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that , I guess , you know , unless they really want it , buy something that , you know , more , well , it , it 's just like having taxes on , or exemptions for kids , you know . It 's a way of increasing the population , that , that was one of the initial ideas of , you know , giving exemptions on kids , on , on federal taxes . Yeah . And where you exempt things , like , uh , uh , one of the best things I heard on taxes to stimulate the economy , someone , brilliant deductor , probably Lloyd Bentsen , said that all , you know , if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes -- Right . -- people would probably be , you know , spending more money using their credit cards . Right . Now , I do n't know if that 's true or not , but if you look on all interest things , not just credit cards , but on your cars and , you know , a- , any kind of interest that you 're paying , from a personal point of view , that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers . Sure . So that 's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go , you know , tax things that they do n't , you know , to a degree , well , like booze , you know , example , they keep raising the taxes on booze , it gets to the point , you know , it makes drunks sober , you know . They quit buying it . Well , what , what about the taxes on cigarettes ?
