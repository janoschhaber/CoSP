Uh , what sort of camping do you like to do the most ? Uh , well , I , I do , uh , real rough type camping . I have a motor home . Huh , rough type , huh ? Yeah . Okay . Uh . Oh , yeah , 

motor homes can be a lot of fun . Yeah , they really are . Yeah . They really are . I 've , I 've enjoyed it . I 've never actually done any , uh , like tent camping , Uh , that can be a lot of fun , too . Yeah . How about you ? Well , so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping . Uh-huh . This summer we went to , uh , the Smokey Mountain National Park . Oh , how great . And , uh , stayed about three or four days in there . It was wonderful . Oh , yeah . Nights were cool enough to where they 're comfortable . Um . And the days were nice and warm and , it was beautiful , beautiful few days . Uh-huh . 

That 's great . It worked out particularly well , especially considering she was , what , six months pregnant . Uh-huh . So , I do n't know , it worked pretty well . It was one of those , uh , those , dome type pop up tents . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Nice and quick and easy to put up . Yeah . Packs away nice and small and , about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto . Well , that 's true , that 's true . It was a lot of fun . 

I guess the last real , uh , camping trip I took was , has been a couple years ago . Oh , yeah ? Uh , I went to California up to the Sequoias . Wow , that 's got to be beautiful territory . Yeah , it 's gorgeous , I love the big trees . Just , just the drive up through , uh , up the coast line -- Yeah . -- and then cut over in , into the , into the parks , it 's gorgeous , though . What , like , Sequoia National Park ? Uh-huh . Uh . Uh-huh , yeah , 

I had been there before when I lived in California , but that 's my first trip back in , oh , goodness , um , um , thirty years maybe . Yeah . But , that is God 's country , it has to be . Yeah . Yeah . Do they still have the , uh , the scenic , uh , roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees ? Uh , no , they do n't , they , the last one , well , the first time I was there , the , the tree was still standing , but it has since come down . Okay . Yeah . But , they are huge . If you 've never seen them , it 's , it 's very awe inspiring . No , so far , New Orleans is far west as I 've gotten . Uh-huh . Well , New Orleans and , uh , Minneapolis . Uh-huh , well , there is lots of pretty country further west . 

Oh , yeah . Yeah . We 're hoping one of these days soon after we 're out of school to head that way . Yeah . Yeah , and you just need to take the little one . Oh , yeah . Show them all the , all the pretties before they go away . Yeah . Yeah . They seem to be trailing out quickly . Yeah , because there is lots to see . 

There is , course , the the Grand Canyon and , uh , the Painted Desert is , is real pretty , in a different sort of way . Yes . And , course , the , the Sequoias and the Redwoods and , and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone and , uh , the Grand Tetons are gorgeous , too . I imagine . Yeah , I would imagine they are . Course , I , I guess I 'm partial to big tree country . Yeah . I do n't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now . I think it 's called a job , I do n't know . 

Uh , not a whole lot of forestry down there , is there ? No , not around here . Oh . Not around here . Place is forested with c- , with those concrete trees . Uh-huh , lot , lot of concrete and glass , you know . Yeah . Well , I guess that 's God 's place , too . Anyway , Yeah . Uh , what do you figure has been the longest trip you 've taken camping ? Uh , probably the , the last one that I went to California I took , uh , three weeks . 

Three weeks . And I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks . Yeah , the whole family , then , was -- Uh-huh . -- in on this ? Everybody . Yeah . Yep . 

That would have to be a blast . Yeah , it really was , it was great . What , well , you went out from Texas up in , into that area ? Uh-huh , yeah . We went , uh , we took the southern route and went , went through , uh , uh , the Grand Canyon , again 

and we stopped at , uh , uh , Las Vegas for a couple of nights , and then , uh , went into Malibu in California over on the coast . Yeah . And then we went up the , the Big Sur Highway all the way up to San Francisco . Okay . And , uh , and then cut across through the wine country . Oh , wow . And then went down to , to , uh , Sequoia National Park . Okay , Big Sur Highway , that 's , uh , where you 're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time -- Oh , yeah . -- are n't you ?
