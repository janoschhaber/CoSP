Okay , well , my favorite , probably , all time T V show is STAR TREK . And I would MUMBLEx it like that , I , I like the adventure of it . Uh-huh . And the idea that , that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space . Uh-huh . And then I like the , they have a new one now . The STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION . Right . Which it 's an all new cast , but kind of the same idea , going out to new places and , and doing new things and finding out about different people , and I 've , I 've always liked that show probably the very best . Uh-huh . I think I 've actually seen a number of STAR TREKS , one way or another over the years . Uh , although I never watched it regularly . I 'm certainly acquainted with the character -- Uh-huh . -- the characters . And then I 've seen some of the STAR TREK movies . Yeah , those , the movies are good too . And I , I guess all , most of the shows I like are , are kind of along the same line because they 're all adventure . Uh-huh . When I , when I started thinking about this , that those are some of my favorite shows , MCGYVER , because it 's , it 's only one person there , more than , uh , you know , instead of a cast -- Uh-huh . 

-- of people , but he 's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap , and grabbing what he can and , you know , pieces of baling wire and , and a few tires and all of a sudden he 's got a hang glider and , I do n't think I , I 've even heard of that show . 

You have n't ? It 's called MCGYVER ? Uh-huh . And what is , what is he ? He 's like a semigovernment type agent . Who goes out then to , uh , works for the Phoenix Foundation , supposedly . Uh-huh . And , uh , h- , his big thing is that he can take pieces of , little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things . He took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder . Uh-huh . So he , he does all kinds of strange things like that . Oh , great . 

Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard , Yeah . and see if he could build a Seven Forty-Seven out of it . See what we can come up with . Do you like the , uh , news shows , TWENTY TWENTY , SIXTY MINUTES , those kind of things ? Well , uh , I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES as a matter of fact , and uh , and I used to like the show very much . Uh-huh . But , unfortunately I find getting rid of your T V set , you do throw out some , some of the baby , Some of the -- with the bath water . -- little things , yeah . And uh , I just decided I had to do that . I think , in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it , I mean I could just sit mindlessly in front of a T V set for hours . Uh . And I just realized , I was sort of like an alcoholic , if I did n't get the booze out of the house , I was going to drink . Oh . So . I guess I have n't ever had any trouble with that . I have more or less , I have my favorite shows and I usually make time in my day or my week , you know , to watch those . Yeah . But , for the most part , I try , I have small kids and I try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time , really when they 're up . Yeah , yeah . Because they 're , I guess that , that , that falls MUMBLEx , and one of my other favorite shows is SESAME STREET because of the kids . I like that real well . Right , well , when my kids were little , I did have a T V set and I did watch a lot of SESAME STREET and a lot of ELECTRIC COMPANY , as well . I do n't think they have that on anymore . 

Well that would be a shame . I have n't seen the ELECTRIC COMPANY in a long time . I , I remember it when I was younger of , you know , catching it on P B S , but , uh , I do n't think they show , it must be in , maybe it 's in , if it was in repeats , but they 're not making new ones . Huh . I have n't seen it in a long time . But SESAME STREET is still really good . Yeah . How about MISTER ROGERS , is he still around ? Yes . Yeah . 

They still show MISTER ROGERS . I do n't think he 's making new ones , but they repeat all the old ones . I see . I see . So that 's still a real good show too . I , that one tends to come on earlier in the day than I want to turn the T V on . Uh-huh . SESAME STREET comes on from like nine to ten , which is a good time and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go , so it 's the timing of , of it is good , besides the amo- , what 's on . Right . I figure your children are preschool ? Yes , I have two little ones . Yeah . 

So they like that . Yeah , I seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon . They come on both . They come on like from nine to ten and then from , uh , five to six . Uh-huh , okay . They just repeat -- Okay . -- over again . Which is also , 

that 's another thing that 's good about it , when it comes on right in the dinner hour . I f , can feel like I can let them sit in front of the T V and watch , and they 're watching something worthwhile , while I can make dinner and do things I need to do -- Yeah . -- without them under foot . Yeah , little , with little kids the T V set really is a , I mean I used it as a pacifier . Yeah . I 'm not sure it was that great for my children , but they turned out okay , so . Uh , it did n't hurt them any . Yeah . Some shows are good for , I think some shows , some , STAR TREK , I , for the imagination of it all . The idea , I , I think that 's one of the things I like about STAR TREK . Uh-huh . And is , is the , even in for kids watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff . I do n't let my little ones watch it , but the imagination of , look what we can do , you know , in the future , this is , perhaps , this will be possible . Yeah . That kind of thing . Yeah . Okay , well , I think we 've covered most of my favorite T V shows . Well , I 'm trying to think if I ever even had a favorite one at one time , uh . 

Let 's see , how about , uh , MAN FROM UNCLE ? I do seem to reme , is that the one where they , uh , he always got this , this tape recording that self-destructed ? That 's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE . 

Uh , MISSION , that 's right , MISSION IMPOSSIBLE . Yeah , I used to watch that . In fact , I can still remember a couple of those . They were , I thought those were very good . Yeah , they always have , I 've , I 've seen some of them on repeats . Yeah . That uh , they always had a good plot . Huh . 

It kind of kept you guessing on , on , uh , what was going to happen next . Right . Right . You , How they 're going get out of their latest scrape . Yeah , I do remember that . And , uh , I remember as a kid my parents watching the ED SULLIVAN Show . That was really the big deal in our household , was the ED SULLIVAN SHOW . 

Oh , yeah , every Saturday night ? Yeah , I gu , I guess it was a Saturday night , and I went to see the movie THE DOORS a couple of days ago , and they had this scene , uh , that por , portraying THE DOORS ' appearance on the ED SULLIVAN SHOW . Huh . They even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan , and it was very , very funny . I think it was the funniest part of the , of that movie . Um . Well , I do n't know , was there any , I remember the MILTON BERLE SHOW even , I was , Ye- , 

I 'm not old enough to recall that one . I was , well I guess , I have to admit that I am . My T V viewing started sort of mid-sixties , so . 

I see . My folks did n't , my folks , I 'm not even sure if we had one when I was really little . That may be why , bu- , they probably did n't have a T V until I got to be , you know , grade school or so . Yeah . And the shows that I like now , they would n't let me watch . I had to catch them all on repeats . Like STAR TREK , they thought that was much too violent for small children . So , Huh . I , I , I ended up watching a lot of these things on , you know , repeats in the afternoons or something . Yeah . That 's , that 's interesting . 

Uh , I think it 's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from TV , people were just as violent before T V was invented , maybe even more so . Yeah . But I guess that 's , that 's a different topic is n't it ? . Probably so . Well , I think that 's about , uh , that 's about covered it for me , so I think I 'll say good-bye and we 'll talk another time perhaps . Yeah . Well , it was nice talking to you . Tell me , tell me where you 're calling from . I 'm calling from Garland , Texas . 

Garland , Texas . Uh-huh . All right . I 'm in Nor- , Where are you from ? I 'm in Raleigh , North Carolina . Oh , my goodness . 

I did n't know they did it long distance . Yeah , I think they 're doing it , trying to do it , or I hope they 're trying to do it all over the country , because they need to collect all kinds of different -- Yes . -- different dialects . 

Well , it was nice talking to you . Same here . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
