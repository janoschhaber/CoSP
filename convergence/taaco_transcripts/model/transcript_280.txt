Okay ? Yes . Well , this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we 're going to a family reunion this weekend . Oh are you really ? Yeah . Where is it going to be ? 

Down at Lake Texoma lodge . Oh . Yes , this is one that 's , uh , the Baker family reunion -- Uh-huh . -- and this has been going on at least , uh , I would say , at least twenty-five years or thirty , Oh , that 's something like that . marvelous . Maybe longer than that , I 'm going to get back into the fifties sometime . Uh-huh . 

First time , I , I married into the family , and the first time I went was about fifty-seven , I think . Uh-huh . But , uh , this one has been well organized and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood , and now it 's Lake Texoma , because that 's more central location -- Uh-huh . -- for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to . I 'm sure location 's really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be . Very important , because , uh , you 'll start losing people if it 's too far to go . Uh-huh . 

We have factions , when it 's one part , we , I have one reunion on my mother 's side , and we found that if it 's in a certain part of Texas , some people come , and if it 's elsewhere , other people come -- Yeah . -- we never get them at both of them -- Never get them at both places , 

-- it seems like , so I think we need to find a new place . Right . Well , listen , they 've , uh , they 've had this one , well it just , of course , over the years it has , uh , built up as far as the organization is concerned -- Uh-huh . -- but now they , uh , have a golf tournament on the Saturday . Um . And then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such . Oh , that 's a neat idea . Yeah , and , uh , everyone , uh , they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge , and everyone brings in food -- Uh-huh . -- and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant , 

and uh -- Uh-huh . -- it really , uh , has worked out . How many people , Jim , are involved ? Uh , generally , uh , I think it 's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people . Wow . I think normal 's about sixty or seventy . Yeah , well , I guess , um , ours probably is n't that big . Our family is dwindling , for one thing . Oh . 

And I often feel funny because I 'm in a branch that 's all but died -- Oh . -- I just have one aunt and my family . So sometimes when these other families get together , they 're really pulling in aunts and uncles and -- Yeah . -- grandkids , and we 're kind of off on the sidelines . But it does remind us that we have family and roots . Right . So we keep going even though we 're not a real big part of it . Yeah , 

well , our family start , reunion started out my wife and I were the kids , the newlyweds , so to speak -- Uh-huh . -- and now we go , our children go , and our grandchildren are going now . Oh that 's great . So it 's , uh , wound up that , uh , we 're the old folks now . Uh-huh , uh-huh . But , um , they have various organized , they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes , uh , to pitch , and they organize a baseball game for the kids -- Uh-huh . -- and several people bring boats , and there 's a place they , they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon , so it -- 

So there 's lots to do . -- it 's a full day . Some of the people -- Uh-huh . -- come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend , and some just come in for Saturday -- Uh-huh . -- so , it , uh , has worked out quite well , and it 's a chance to see some of the relatives you do n't see all year long -- Uh-huh -- -- except that once a year . -- that 's true . Well , that 's neat . I think , think they 're really fun . We go to mine regularly , and then we go to my husband 's occasionally down in Temple , and he has a large family , so it 's , it 's fun when we go to that one . Yeah , 

my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia , and I think we 've been to one in thirty-five years or something like that , so , Oh . That 's just too far away . Yeah , yeah that , that is a problem with the distance . The people that we have that do n't come are out El Paso way -- Yeah . 

-- and it 's just too much for all of them , It 's an , all of that group to travel . all day drive just to get to this area . Right . But then we have the same attitude when it 's out , there , although this year we 're going out . They 're going to have it at Fort Davis -- Yeah . -- and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time -- Yeah . -- as well as reunion . Yeah , we have , each year , of course , they elect officers of the family reunion -- Uh-huh . -- and a number of years ago , back in the early eighties , my wife was president . We discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together . Uh-huh . And it takes a lot of planning , And choose , and assembling of stuff . some place that everybody 's going to like -- Right . -- as far as food and all that . That 's correct . That 's a heavy burden . Yes , it is , I tell you . I do n't really care for her to be president again . No . But that is , uh , it 's , it 's a lot of work , but it 's a lot of fun . Uh-huh . We 've enjoyed it , and -- 

Well , I think , -- the grandkids really enjoy it because it 's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma . Yeah , and it 's , it 's good for kids to know that they have other family . Yeah , 

and this year they 're all excited . The show this weekend , this weekend 's going to be a rock and roll show -- Oh , boy . -- my two grandsons and one of their cousins are , are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song -- Oh , what fun . -- you know , in jeans and t-shirts and such . Uh-huh . So , it 's , uh , it 's going to be exciting for them , and for us too . Uh-huh . Probably lots of laughs . 

Oh , yes , there have been some really wild shows put on there . They , uh , really get , uh , into it . Uh-huh . Well , it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along . 

Ours , ours is still kind of loosely organized , and -- Yeah , well , -- the same people usually get stuck with doing it . And , Oh , that generally happens . they do it as a labor of love . Yeah . So , the officer idea is a good idea . Yeah , 

well we 've , uh , had various things over the years , uh , to raise funds for it -- Uh-huh . -- and again , it 's not , it 's not cheap to rent the lodge up there -- Yeah . -- or the meeting room down in the cabins and such , but , uh -- Uh-huh . -- they 've come up with , they 've tried passing the hat , and they 've had auctions and various things to raise funds , and , uh -- Uh-huh . -- some people do and some people do n't . Yeah , and it 's not fair that everybody not contribute , 

Excuse me . But , um , anyway , that 's the family reunion story . Uh-huh . Okay . Well , thanks a lot I enjoyed talking to you . Bye . Been nice talking to you . Bye .
