Okay , this topic is , is Russia a threat to our security ? I think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time . how do you feel about it ? Well , they do have , uh , a major internal problem . 

Everybody wants to defect , and I can understand why . Um , I think their biggest problem is just , you know , obtaining food to live , so when you have the basic needs , uh , being unmet , I do n't think you think globally as far as , you know , being a threat to other people in the world . So , as soon as they get their , their own home country taken care of , then they 'll consider , what they can do with the rest of the world . 

I believe Communism is very much waning . It 's , uh , pretty much on the way out of the door , insofar as the strong hold that they used to have , and the Russian people are all realizing that the Communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world , and their rebellions right now is the result of that . If they can get the army , or the military to sway to their side , I think that , uh , it will be on the way out eventually . It 's just a matter of time , because , in the Baltic States they have already massacred so many people who protested , and that has n't set too well with their diplomacy for the , regarding the , uh , outcome of their affairs . What 's your synopsis ? . Well , I do , I do realize that , uh , uh , the Bush Administration is n't too happy with , with how they 're handling their internal , uh , strife , you know , as far as diplomacy is concerned . 

I think it 's been a good , a good positive direction for uh , the Soviets as far as Yeltsin is concerned . You know , he was , uh , allowed to , what , wh , in his , in the Congress they , they gave him more power as far as his republic in Russia is concerned , which is , gives him more power overall , which I think is a good sign that there will be some , you know , politically speaking , you know , he 's going to have more power , , and I think it 's a step in the right direction . I think Gorbachev realizes that he 's got a , a major uh , uh , power figure , you know , competing against him , and I think it 's going to be pretty close to his demise if he does n't follow suit with Yeltsin as far as , uh , realizing , well , he does realize it , you know , with the fact that they reduced the uh , or they , increased the prices on their food , food and goods . Uh-huh . Uh . 

I think that it went up a thousand percent on most , It , yeah . Tha- , that 's incredible but they had to , uh , go in the direction of a market driven economy , and , and they had to bite the bullet for that . So that 's a good move , on , on Gorbachev 's part in doing that . Uh-huh . So , but Gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that , he 's moving towards a two to three party system of government that , nor eliminating or diminishing the Communist power , and I guess that 's where Yeltsin steps in , so far as his politics of government goes , uh , but I do n't know how convinced the people are of him yet , myself . Well , that 's all they got right now . That 's their ray of hope . Uh-huh . So , you know , they 'll go with , you know , whoever comes through for them . 

I , it , it 's just that , the weird thing is , is that Gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates , as far as with glasnost and poistro- , perestroika and stuff , and I think he 's got between the Old Guard and , , and the new , uh , glasnost . Uh , I think it 's kind of escalated to a point where it 's out of control . Uh-huh . And I think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how , in order to keep the peace on , peace on both sides . So I think that 's where you know , , kind of where he 's stuck . You know what I 'm saying ? Yeah . Uh , I understand . And that 's the , that 's the situation that he finds himself in , and you know , he 's a tough guy , I mean , he 's been through it . So I have no doubt that he 'll , I mean , I , I think overall he 's been a , a , good figure for the Soviet Union . I mean , I think his intentions and his ideals are , are uh , well intentioned . Uh-huh . And in the long-term , but I just think that because of the basic needs that the people do n't have , I think that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him look , look worse that what his , um , what his ideals are , personally . I agree . What 's bad for the Soviet system is that , they have the resources to grow and produce their food , but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should . I think it 's , I think it 's a lot of , uh , oh , how do you put it ? , bureaucracy and , and , uh , one thing , and then all the corruption . I think there 's a , a large amount of corruption on the , the have and the have-nots . Yeah . That 's probably more true than , You know , I -- a lot of people realize . -- I know you 're going to have that with every society . 

At least we 're more blatant about it , but it 's very secret , and it 's been going on for years . I mean , you ca n't change things overnight . Uh-huh . And , but if it gets to a point where people ca n't , survive , I mean , there 's revolution . You know , and that 's , It seems to be headed in that direction too . Yeah , big time , major , but you know , that 's , that 's what happens when , you know , the cork blows and you ca n't handle it anymore . I mean , that 's -- -- that 's the way the world , uh , you know , revolves that way . and uh , I think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things , too . They , 

probably not enough , but I 'm sure I lot of it 's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind , of what they 're missing out on . Yeah , I think they 're starting to realize , but I , I just do n't think they have the resources , if you were to compare , uh , the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fact machines , Fax machines and cellular phones , and state of the art equipment that we are so used to . 

I do n't think they even realize what 's out there , and to what extent . Yeah , I 'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items . Yeah , the major conveniences of life . Yeah what we consider just , I do n't , normal everyday things to them is real luxury . Yeah . Which is unfortunate for them , and of course , most of us , we do n't really appreciate what we 've got because we 've been so used to it . This is true . This is very true . And we , it 's human , it 's human nature though to take things for granted and it kind of , you know , 

when you 've lost something or , or uh , uh , do n't have what other people have that 's when you tend to realize , you know , what 's out there and what , you know , what you have and what you do n't have . Yeah I agree . So the original question , do we think they 're a threat to our , you know , a security threat ? Yeah . Um , yes and no . Yeah , I can go with that answer too . The only yes I could go to is if uh , a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to , to a nuclear exchange , but I do n't even see that occurring . Um , no . Uh , because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to I guess . Well , I do n't really feel that the Soviets really want to blow up the world . I mean , um , we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as , as nonfeeling machine type people , and they 're people just like us . I mean -- Uh-huh . -- you know , they get up everyday , and they put their pants on the same way , and they have to eat and everything else , and I just do n't feel that ...
