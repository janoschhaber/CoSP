Hello Hello Hi . Hi . My name 's Gail . I 'm calling from Texas . I 'm Sandy . I 'm in Texas , too . 

Oh , what a deal . Took long enough to find you . Oh , really ? Yeah , seems like they take forever any more , but , um , so did you hear what the topic was -- Yes . -- did she tell you , okay . Yeah . Great , well , if you 're ready , then , uh , I 'll just go ahead and start . Okay , Okay , hold on . Okay , well I guess we 're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women . Yeah . Seems like , um , to me , everything is just changing so much that it 's almost like , um , you ca n't keep up with things any more , and everything is , uh , ther- , everyone 's striving so much to make it equal between men and women , I personally , I 'm a stay home mom , and I like it the way it used to be . So am I . Are you , 

You know , I think it 's kind of coming back around to that , do n't you , I mean , that there 's a lot more people that stay home now than before , but I guess more than anything I think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do , you know -- Yeah . -- I do n't know , I mean I think sometimes some of the , the women 's lib though , is kind of like they wanted it all , you know , and you ca n't have everything -- Uh-huh . -- I do n't , I do n't think that you can have , I mean , there 's no way I could have a career and then be the kind of mom that I want to be -- Yeah . -- and to me that 's more important . Ho , how many kids do you have ? Two . Two ? Uh-huh . Are they young , or , Five and two . Five and two . I have two , and mine are two and nine months , so , um , being , being home is real , 

I , I just am fortunate because I do n't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home , and , uh , I just , it 's just weird that I was just talking to somebody this morning who 's , who 's a working , uh , lady , a working mom , and , you know , these people have secretaries and these high power jobs , and it just seems like , um , she , she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care , and , uh , I just think , I , I , I just do n't agree with that . I think it should be that people should get back to staying home and , and being family , more family oriented than , than not . You know , it seems like everybody 's always so busy with everything that they 're doing that there 's no time for this and that and the other , and I hope it just does n't get to where , you know , there 's more women , more and more women going into the work force . Well , I agree , I mean , but , I , I hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work , too , saying , you know , you should stay home , you know , otherwise your children are n't going to , you know , turn out , or whatever -- Yeah . 

-- because that 's not fair to , you know , like the single moms that have to work , or , if they would n't be able to make ends meet -- Uh-huh . -- not working or whatever , I mean , I think it 's got to be a personal choice , and , it 's nice that , that we could have the choice to stay home . Yeah , well I find that I , whenever I have to , whenever I 'm in a group of people and we 're discussing things , like just over the weekend I visited my family , and some cousins I had n't seen in a long time , 

and everyone 's all interested in what everybody 's doing , and , uh , you know , well , I had my baby with me , and I found that all I talked about was my baby , which was fine with me , but it 's like , you know , here these people are , they 're going to school , getting degrees , making all this money , and , you know , they kind of looked at me like I was from the dark ages , you know , like I , because I did n't have really all that much to talk about , uh , where career and things like that were concerned , and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while -- Yeah . -- in social situations sometimes , which is too bad , because , you know , I , I feel like I do n't , obviously I do n't get paid for my job , but I should get paid at least double what my husband makes working in an office for staying home -- Yeah . -- that 's what I figure , I 'm worth a lot just for what I do every day , but , you know , I do n't know , this is kind of a , um , at , at least here I 've noticed , I 'm not from here , I 'm from Colorado , but I 've really noticed that there are a lot of , uh , a lot more people that are more comfortable , at least , with some women being home and , at least in the circles I 've travelled and in the church that I go to , you know , that men do n't treat you like you do n't know anything , generally -- Yeah . -- speaking . 

Well , and I think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or , you know , even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff , and I think that 's really important -- Yeah . -- that , that they do that and they realize there 's a need for that , and , um , I do n't know , I found when I did do some work when my son was young , it was like contract work , and it was n't where I had to be there every day , but , I mean , we were going to the doctor once a week , so , I do n't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor . Yeah , yeah , 

I can see where that would definitely hinder the problem , definitely . Well ,
