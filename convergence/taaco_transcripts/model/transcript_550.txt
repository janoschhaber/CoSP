So , uh , do you happen to be working for a large firm ? Well , it 's about three hundred and fifty people . I guess that 's not large compared to some , but it 's big enough . Uh-huh . And they have a , they do n't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything and I wish they did . Yeah . You know , they have a four O one K , but I put all the money into it . Uh-huh . They do n't add anything . What about you ? 

Uh , I work for a fairly large company . It 's got eight thousand people . Uh-huh . And , uh , we do have health insurance . We do n't have four O k- , one K plan , stuff like that , but we do have , like , retirement . They kind of match up to , you , if you put six percent , they match up to six percent , and then the rest is whatever you want to put in . If you put more than that or something like that . 

Oh , that 's a pretty good deal . It 's not bad . Now , how long does it take for your contribution to vest ? God , I do n't know . It 's probably a long time . 

I 'm sure it 's not till like twenty-five years , thirty years . Yeah , the place I work at 's , health insurance is kind of expensive . It 's like hundred bucks a , a month or something -- Yeah . -- for a family . Huh , well , I guess what we have is like a f- , what they call a flex benefits plan where you , you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need . Otherwise you can , uh , guess you can put , also put money , hold money back and then either use or lose it and that does n't get taxed or can just have that money , you know , put in your paycheck . Yeah , we have one of those use it or lose it plans , too , where , uh , they 'll basically pay for , uh , you know , child care type , uh , expenses . I can send in a , uh , can send in a request for payment and they 'll , uh , and they 'll send me , you know a check for the amount they withheld . That 's pretty good , you know . It 's , uh , it saves a third off on taxes or something . Yeah , well , it depends on which company you work for . I know that , like , the , the , the one plan that everyone seems to be in , in my place is , uh , you know , you , uh , think you call it plan D . Deductibles are really high , it 's like fifteen hundred dollars , but if you go for the other ones you 're paying too much money for them because it 's unlikely , if you 're f- , relatively , uh , healthy , then it 's really unlikely that you 'd use that much , amount of money , you know . So , the- , it , you know , someone did start a cost benefit analysis , and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and , and take a loss , what , whatever it happens to be , if you happen to be a healthy individual . Yeah , I guess , uh , on the other hand , you know , I , I had a similar , had a similar health plan and , uh , one of my kids was in a car accident and , uh -- Um . -- I had , wound up having to pay for , you know , a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of , you know , no , no insurance policy happened to cover it , which is , Really ? 

You mean , not even your , your , your car insurance ? Well , it , it got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance , no fault here , and , and I had a high deductible on the on the , uh , on the c- , car insurance and then s- , you know , we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it . 

Oh , that 's too bad . Oh , well . Yeah , uh , well , I do n't know , I think other than health insurance , I think , uh , you know , an extra week of , uh , time off would be nice . I only get two weeks . Yeah , yeah 

my place you get two weeks when you start and then every , every year they give you an extra day until you 've got four weeks . Oh , that 's nice . We do n't get them till , till your seventh year of service till -- Aye . -- you get an extra week . 

That 's a long time . Yeah , it 's , uh , Yeah , especially in the kind of engineering job I 'm in , you know , companies do n't stay afloat that long , and , and they , Uh , with the telecommunications type of company , supposedly you , used to be much more stable . 

It 's a lot less stable than it used to be . They used to have job security crap , but now they do n't . So you work for Bell or something like that ? Yeah , it 's the Bell Corps , which is , uh , Right . Yeah . Right . So , I do n't know , it 's , it 's , uh , no longer . So that 's what , 

I think it 's still based on the old model of , and , and now they do n't , uh , A lifelong job security telephone -- Yeah . 

-- pioneers of America , all that stuff , huh . Yeah , but they , no , no longer . 

I do n't think so . Right . Uh , hearing a lo- , there 's always , they 're always laying people off , which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security . Is it , I mean , does it , they must have pretty good severance , though , huh ? 

Oh , I do n't know , we do n't , we have n't been doing layoffs . We 've been doing , uh , down sizing with , uh , getting rid of extra layers of management . And , uh , I do n't know what they do for those people . 

Mean the , the , the management they get rid of ? Some of it , yeah . Um . There 's too many manage , too many chiefs and not enough Indians but , Oh , they , they put ,
