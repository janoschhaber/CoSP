What 's the , uh , in Texas law has a , uh , what does it have , it has a death penalty does n't it ? Oh , yes , yeah . 

They just , uh , started it again , too just late , or , within the past few years . You know for quite some time , just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty . But now it 's coming back into favor . Uh , yes . 

Well , they find it is more deterrent . Well , my sociology class at S M U 's taught us that it was not a deterrent . Uh , but now that 's just what they said . Uh , I do n't know maybe , maybe if I went back and took a sociology class now they 'd say it is a deterrent . Well , uh , if you , Maybe they 've changed their minds . You know , compare the figures , I think that 's where they 're , uh , they 're coming from . The , uh , Maybe that 's it . Maybe that 's it , because that was back in the seventies . Oh , they 're yes . They are . That was before the , uh , uh , they adopted the death law again . 

But , uh , I , I myself am in favor of it , uh , particularly for , uh , well I think Texas has a good , good law . Uh , crimes , murders related with , uh , drugs or killing a policemen . I think , I agree . But I think it ought to be expanded to include children . I , I think they 're , they have they 're working on , uh , something in Austin now , Uh-huh . and I 'm not sure what it is , I just remember seeing a , uh , kind of a synopsis of it . Uh-huh . Well , why stop at children ? Why not go to adults , too ? Well , uh , I 'm , I 'm personally very in favor of it . Uh-huh . Uh , why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they 've mowed down a class yard full of kids or t , or tried to , or done their very , you know , given their best effort at doing that . Uh-huh . Yep . I , I do n't care to support them . Well , I do n't either but , uh , uh , but there is something to be said about , or , uh , uh , j- , just for the sake of argument , I 'm taking the , Sure . a con , I 'm , I 'm against it . Uh , you know yourself how many times have you heard where , uh , uh , a citizen was wrongfully arrested , Uh-huh , uh-huh . 

and served time at a penitentiary , uh , just recently this , uh , black man served nine years was it , And then , for robbery . there was the black woman that , uh , robbed and shot the furrier . 

And she was set free , too , just in two examples in Texas recently . Uh-huh . But she actually killed the furrier . Or someone , she was charged with murder and then , then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something . I did n't , I do n't , I did n't retain all those facts very well . But I know what you 're , what if we make a mistake . 

That 's it . And that 's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything . Uh-huh . Well , right now our laws are so liberal that , uh , even with the death penalty in effect , I do n't think that , uh , they 're going to use it , uh , too frequently , uh , unfortunately . I , like you , say yes 

let 's have it , Well , put them all , give them all a shot , get rid of them . Why should they be sit , sitting in , uh , prison getting their college degree . Well , I guess , though , where I would have a problem with it if I were on the jury that , that , put , that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person 's guilty . Uh-huh . 

Now that 's tougher . It 's easier to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that , yeah , the death penalty 's the way to go , it 's a deterrent to crime , they should n't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway . But to be the actual one of the ones that decide , that would be tougher for me . Yes , very true . I , uh , I agree with you there . I think I 'd probably do it but we could never say what we would do if we 're not in the circumstance . It , that 's , that 's , that 's a real easy thing to say that , oh , sure I would , but I do n't know . Uh-huh . 

Well , I myself would n't want to be on the jury like that . Uh , I , it , it 's , uh , that 's an awful lot to , uh , to expect of a person , to , uh , to kill somebody is what it amounts to . Well , yes , but , you know , that 's what they did . It , true . Very true . But they , they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason . Or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted . Yeah And they , they wanted something worse than they , more than they respect the human life . Uh-huh . Yeah , exactly . 

Well , anyhow I guess we both agree that , that it is , Hang them . it should be in effect . Yeah , I agree it should be in effect . Also I agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement , uh , so I guess I would say I want it to be in effect but I want , maybe well , I 'd , I , now I have a problem with this , too . I think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance . Oh , that 's true . 

Well now any , uh , just believe in just about any state in the union , uh , uh , a death , uh , or , uh , yeah , death verdict is an automatic , uh , appeal . That 's correct . It is , it is . And , uh , uh , yes , I 'm inclined to agree with you . I think so , there should be a limit as to the number of appeals . Now , there 's some , 

and maybe , now , I do n't remember if this is Texas or not , that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence . Um , um , well , n- , Convicted drug dealers . Not just for dealing in drugs . It , uh , 

Is it , what is , what 's the ru- , There are certain circumstances , and I do n't remember what they are . It 's something of the dis- , they 're on the distribution end . 

Uh , yes . They 're not selling them , they 're distributing them . It 's for the large dealers is what , Uh-huh . it 's reserved for . And they , they are in effect killing people . Oh , oh , yes , yes . 

I , I believe it 's any capital crime related to drugs . Oh , okay . I think that 's the way it 's worded . Is that how it 's worded ? I knew it was there but , I , I , or p- , or is it proposed or is it passed ? I do believe that 's in . Uh , I would n't swear to it myself . I believe it is , But I thought it , I thought it was in effect . I believe you 're right , though . I think it is . And I have to agree with that . Uh-huh . I , I think it certainly should be one of the options . 

Uh , I 've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren , so far that I know . I qualify that heavily , because you never know , but to the best of my knowledge we have n't had a major problem yet . Uh-huh . Oh , it does . Uh , I have four sons myself , and the youngest is twenty-eight , so they are all pretty well grown up and they all went through it , you know , going through high school and everything and knock wood that , uh , they have not , well I wo n't say they did n't try it , uh , I would n't know , but , uh , they , I doubt very much that they 're , they 're using it now . In fact I 'm sure they do n't . Well , my children are about in the same age bracket . I think , let 's see , the oldest is thirty-two and the youngest is probably twenty-seven , twenty-eight . Huh . So , it 's the same age bracket . Yes . And there 's four , two girls and two boys . And I think one of each experimented very slightly with pot , Uh-huh . and I think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge . Yeah . That 's usually the way it is . It , it 's just , uh , try it out with their peers . And none of them even smoke . They do n't , uh , they never , 

strangely enough , uh , their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up . Now , my , my , my wife , my ex-wife , she quit , uh , well , when she was pregnant with the last one and she never started up again . And I just quit , oh , about fourteen months and two weeks ago . Boy , that 's tough . Yes , it is . I , 

and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by . My husband has n't quit , yet . And he knows he has to and he knows he should and he knows and he knows , Um . but he has n't . I do respect the fact , though , that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me . He , he 's very conscious of , of passive smoking and he 's concerned about it but , Well , has n't quite made it yet . Well , when I was still smoking , I , I felt that way . If I was in a public restaurant , seated at table with , uh , non smokers I would try to pick a s- , a , a my , seat where the smoke would blow away from them . Or I 'd hold the cigarette under the table . Yeah , I 've seen all of this , yeah . And , uh , but , uh , now I 'm on , the shoe 's on the other foot . Uh , I 'm aware of other people smoking now . 

Well , Charles will actually , Charles will not smoke in anyone else 's house except our own . Um . He will get up and he 'll go outside , you know , and he , he 's so , when we 're invited to people 's house , he will not smoke in their house . Which I think is good because there 's a lot of people that are very , Yes . particularly if they have children . Uh-huh . But , uh , and he 's , you know , he tries his best , but the actual quitting he has n't done . He changed brands to a brand he does n't like . He put up all of his ash trays . He will not smoke in a comfortable position , you know , but -- Uh , uh-huh . -- still , he 's done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking . It 's a , 

Well , the , long process . there 's a trick I use . They used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment . Oh , how neat . And every time I wanted one I have to go outside and just take one . One at a time . And , uh , that , that 's , gets to be , uh , a deterrent . He has his in the kitchen ,
