All right . I 've never done it before , so I guess that 's all I have to do , right . 

I guess so . I 've been called several times , and I push in , pushed in my number , they kept saying you have the invalid code -- Oh , really . -- and then I found out that my new phone was n't working right . Oh . Oh , so this is the first time I 've even done it . Yeah . I wonder how long it 's going to be on for . I think five minutes is the max . 

Oh , no , I mean , this whole thing , like for two months or something , do you know ? 

Oh , I do n't know . Yeah , okay , well back to crime , I guess we 're supposed to talk about that . They say what aspect are you worried about , well , I think at this point , I for one am worried about every aspect . Right , 

especially , uh , you , since you 're in the same metroplex , you know , there 's so much going on here . I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common , that 's really a , something you got to protect yourself from . Well , that , and in the schools , too -- Uh-huh , golly 

I know . -- starting to put metal detectors in , and , Have they done that in Garland ? No , I , not that I 'm aware of . Now , um , I just heard , you know , last week at that one school , they started putting them in because there was that one shooting -- Right . -- so , um , 

Well , we had a vice principal shot at here -- Is that right ? -- last year on the , you know , on the school grounds after school . And the one boy killed himself a few years ago , in the , in a grade school , so -- Uh-huh . -- you know , these kids do n't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any -- -- in any neighborhood , does n't seem like . Yeah , yeah . So . Yeah , it 's kind of scary to think , you send your child to school and you wonder if he 's going to get shot . I mean , we did n't have to worry about that before . I know . What next ? I know , it 's , it 's , it 's getting , 

it 's been out of hand , I think , for a while , and it just continues to get worse . Right , and , you know , we ca n't really depend on the police to solve all this , they just ca n't do it . Yeah . 

I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family -- Right . -- to a certain extent and , uh , and how we going to bring that back together . Yeah , that 's , I thi- , I agree , 

I think that 's where it stems from , is that and , um , you know , you 've got a lot of , a lot more women that are working nowadays -- Uh-huh . -- that are n't home with the children -- Right and , -- and that may impact it as well . I think so , 

and , and then there 's a drop in , uh , the training of morals , really , you know . Right , right . These , some of these young kids you read about , just does n't bother them to kill someone at all -- Yeah -- -- I think -- 

-- they do n't think twice about it . -- I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals , you know -- Yeah . -- would n't kill somebody in cold blood . Either that or I do n't know if it happened and it was n't as highly publicized as it is now , or what the , what the , I think it was just rare , I really do . Uh-huh . My mother , well , she 's like seventy-four now . She , when she was a young girl , she had a beautiful , beautiful cousin that lived in California , and she was dating this millionaire 's son and he wanted to marry her , and she would n't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both , and , uh , You 're kidding . No , I 'm the one , 

Himself and her ? Yeah , that must have been at least fifty years ago or more , but -- Oh , wow , -- the point of the story is that , that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers , all over the country for weeks -- I bet . -- but now , you know , you would n't probably read about it here in Texas -- Oh , I know , -- it 's just , you know , another killing . Well , they were , I was watching some show the other day , and they were talking about , uh , mass murderers -- Uh-huh . -- and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently , and -- Um . 

-- they were saying , you know , that these guys want attention , and that when it happens they 're glorified because all the newspaper , it 's on -- Uh-huh . -- all the newspapers -- Uh-huh . -- and T V -s and everything , Right , lots of their picture and life story and everything . Right , and then you get to their life story , Oh , they came from a broken family -- Uh-huh . -- oh this person had mental problems -- Right . -- oh duh , duh , duh -- Right . -- you know , I know , how we MUMBLEx and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible , Yeah . So , uh , that story I just told you about my mother 's beautiful cousin , well , the same thing happened here in Arlington , when was it , I think it was , oh , it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with . Is that right ? Yeah , I think it was on a Hard Copy , she was a real attractive blond girl , in , in her freshman year of college -- Uh-huh . -- and some boy she tried to get rid of , he was like in his twenties , Uh , I remember seeing that , Remember that ? I saw that on Hard Copy . Right , right , that 's , uh , Yes . My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School . Is that right ? Yeah , can you believe it , that 's just , uh , I 'm trying to remember , 

he , um , had her in the car in front of a Taco MUMBLEx or something -- Taco Bueno , right , uh-huh . -- and he just shot them -- Uh-huh . -- himself and her . Right . I remember seeing that . Yeah , uh , uh , is n't that weird ? Yeah , there 's just too many crazy people out there these days . I know , 

and , uh , the police are not going to do anything until they , they 've committed some sort of a crime . You know , he was just begging her on the phone , that 's not doing anything . Yeah . And there are times I think , gee , I MUMBLEx should give my kids gu- ,
