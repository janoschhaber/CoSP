Hi , well , I guess , w , which one have you got right now ? Or , Well , I , uh , couple of them , I , at the moment , use an A S T two eighty-six and I got a leading edge and I got a American one and had a I B M one , but , 

My , my , just a couple . What do you have ? Uh , I 've got an Omega 

and I 've got a , uh , generic three eighty , or four eighty-six machine . Oh , yeah ? Yeah , it 's very , very generic . What did you do , put it together ? Yeah , 

and , and , uh , upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled and -- Well , that 's , -- now , now it 's , now it 's a fast machine . Yeah . 

That 's all I got to say for it . Yeah . What do you use it for ? Huh ? What do you use it for ? Uh , work , uh , I 'm a contract programmer . Oh , yeah ? What kind of programs do you , Uh , anything . Okay , I mean like business programs or , 

Uh , I 've done business programming , scien , you know , scientific applications like , you know , petroleum science stuff and , Man . Uh , uh , test equipment and I did the , I , I did one that was , the demonstration of a touch , touch screen for a company that sells , uh , touch screens . It was kind of fun . Uh-huh , Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display . Huh . And make it look like things like , uh , you know , attack simulators and MUMBLEx , and -- Well , that 's , -- all sorts of little things you 'd want to put your finger on the screen for . Well , that sounds interesting . 

Matter of fact , uh , I guess you do , uh , you get a lot of graphics in there , I imagine , huh . Oh , yeah , definitely . That 's where the speed helps out . Uh , yeah , 

unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz , eighty , eighty-six . It 's like slow . Yep , that will , that will , slow you up . Huh ? Well , I , I do , uh , uh , programming for C N C turret presses and -- Uh-huh . -- uh , cat cam system type things and , uh , really need a faster system . Uh , I got a new line that I , I sell metal fabricating equipment , and cat cam systems , and tooling , et cetera . Uh-huh . Uh , I know a guy that upgrades , uh , for a reasonable cost . 

Who is that ? Uh , his name is T Q or something like that . And my notebook is somewhere around here . See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough . I 've tried to do is get this outfit to -- Uh , he 's , uh , up in , -- give me one . Huh ? 

That 's how I got my other ones by selling their product for them . They not only give me a demonstrator , but the hardware as well as the software . Uh-huh . And as they , 

Oh , that works . And as they go to the next one I just keep the , that 's why I have so many different levels of P C -s around at the moment . Uh , here it is . A T S Computers . A T S ? Uh-huh . And where are they at ? Uh , do you know where , uh , Custer is ? 

Oh , yeah . Okay , he 's , uh , uh , south of Renner on , on Custer . And there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like , or , strip kind of center . In Richardson there . Huh ? 

In Richardson ? Uh-huh . I know where you mean . There is a Mobil and all that kind of s- , uh , on that one corner , that 's about Lookout there , I think , is n't it . Right , it 's , it 's , it 's just south of there . Yeah . 

It 's a little place , looks like a castle . Yeah . Kind of , uh , little guy in there . He , he , uh , gives reasonable prices . Oh . Like I , I traded my , uh , three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred . Really ? Well , that 's a good deal . Yeah , it was pretty reasonable . Yeah . 

But , uh , uh , he , and he does a good job and he , s- , he , he , uh , guarantees everything he sells . Uh , there is a lot , you ever go by Lucky Computer there ? Uh-huh , yeah . I used to , when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys , I 'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems . Uh-huh . Have n't been doing much of that for the last year or so . 

So I , I do n't know where those guys are at these days . But I , MUMBLEx , Uh , they , they 're up there in that mall . Uh , just below Campbell . Yeah . Or that strip , strip , center . Yeah . They 're still doing business . Big business , apparently . I tell you , those prices have just , unbelievably come down . Uh-huh , 

oh , yeah , I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in , you know , it 's like , wow . Yeah . That works , I 'll go do that . I , And boy that thing screams now . Yeah , 

I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed , the three eighty-six . That was n't alive for but maybe two years . Uh-huh . Well , I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the , the price difference is about ten dollars . Is that right ? That 's it ? Yeah , it , when it comes on the manufacturing floor it 's about ten bucks . I 'll be darned . Yeah . Huh , well ,
