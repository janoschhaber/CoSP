Jeri ? Yes . We 're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done with it . That 's a rather , rather broad topic . They 're usually pretty broad anyway . Yeah . Where do you live ? Uh , we live in Plano . Okay , so , that 's a , Uh , and where you are ? I 'm in Richardson , so -- Uh-huh . -- when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at , uh , Maceo High School -- Right . -- in Dallas . Right , that is so frightening . It is , you know , Uh , do you have children in school ? No , mine are already in college now , so -- Yeah . -- I do n't have to , at least when they were in high school , it was beginning but not like the rampages . Well , I have , my oldest is his first year in high school so we have all this to , to look forward to , 

and it is really frightening , uh , to think that you ca n't even send them to school in safety . I mean , certainly , you know , you ca n't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas , but , you know , when you ca n't even , send them on their normal activities in safety , it , it 's really frightening . That 's true . And , uh , I really , you know , they 're coming down on the principal , but I really do n't know what they can do . I mean , it 's just in so much of society with the violence 

and the kids having access to weapons and drugs and I , I really do n't know what , what can be done . Yeah , well , I just , I just do n't understand how , of course , in my little world , how guns could be so available . Well , I do n't either , but apparently they just really are . Uh , I mean , to me , in Plano you would think that would be about , you know , about as innocent as you could get for , for being in a , a large area . But , you know , my son comes home and tells me that , you know , he hears kids talk about having guns and , uh , someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun . 

Oh , my heavens . And , I mean , it just scared me to death and , you know , they called the police and , and nothing happened , but my goodness , you know , it , it could have easily . Well , maybe that 's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution . Maybe so . You know , because I do n't , now I , somehow I feel we 're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen , you know , across the street , or seeing someone get mugged , or unfortunately , raped , and people do n't do anything . Yeah . A woman was raped in Richardson , I read in the paper oh , about a two weeks ago now . And all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help . Oh , no . But nobody , nobody did anything . 

I just ca n't imagine that . You know , I mean they heard someone calling for help . Nobody even called the police to say , you know , I hear a strange screaming -- Right . -- I 'm afraid , you know , if you , I do n't blame people with today 's society about going out to help themselves . Right , well , I can see , you know , especially if you heard screams from a house or something , not going over there maybe , because , you know , it could be dangerous , but certainly I ca n't understand not calling the police . Yeah . I , I just , you know , it 's , it 's really frightening that we 're not , we 're trying to live in our own little cocoons and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention . Right . Well I , I think you 're right there . I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business , but I think that 's real dangerous and , uh , I do n't know . I try to tell my kids just , just kind of be aware of what 's around them , you know 

and , if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble , just get out of it or call for help , whichever . Yes . But , uh , Yeah , well , you know , the call for help is what scares me now because it , it just , I do n't know , people just do n't , I do n't know , I ca n't say they do n't care , because people just have to care about another person . Yeah . But it 's that not getting involved , that impersonal society , I think we live in today . Well , maybe this thing with , with the child at school , maybe that will make people think a bit more and , you know , take some steps to , to correct it . I do n't know , it 's , it really is , is frightening . Yeah . I , uh , Let me ask you , getting back to your son 's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police are n't doing , he did n't have a license for the gun , correct ? I do n't know . I mean , I do n't know the details . 

This was not a child that was on the team . It was someone that , uh , show , you know , just kind of showed up at the field . Uh-huh . Uh , it was a , a student age person , but I 'm not even ,
