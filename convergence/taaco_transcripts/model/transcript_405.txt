Push my number . Okay . Okay . So are you a , a , a golfer or are you a spectator ? Oh , I 'm a , I play golf but I do n't actually play golf . Well , I 'm the same way . I , Yeah . 

I go out there and hit the ball . Hack it all over the place ? Yeah . It 's sickening , is n't it ? Um , uh , well , in the Carolinas it 's , it 's just , you know , we 've got a bunch of golf courses around here . Yeah . We 've got tons up here but I do n't know . How do you feel about your game ? I guess that 's a good question ? Uh , well , I mean I 'm not a serious golfer at all , uh , uh , a friend of mine goes golfing a lot and he drags me out every now and then and I , uh , I do n't have a , I do n't really even have a game . I usually when I go out and play golf it 's usually like at a , at one of these par threes that , Yeah . 

you know , you , but , um , I like watching it on T V . Yeah , I like that too . I do n't know 

I try to play , but God , I , a couple years ago I played two , three times a week and got lousy . I guess that 's the best I ever got was lousy . And I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come and then I got worse again so . to get me they , they say I hit worm burners because I , I ca n't hit it up in the air . Yeah . So I 'm pretty bad but I , I , I get great distance hitting it , you know , MUMBLEx across the ground , and if it 's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I 'm , but I 'm getting better . I 've got where now I can hit it in , in the air some of the time . That 's pretty good . Yeah . Uh , so I 'm kind of a novice at it . Um , I 'm that and worse . I , I play next year I , actually I take it kind of seriously but I 've been doing so bad . 

Next year , I always say this every year , but next year I 'm starting over from scratch . I 'm going to go take lessons and everything . I 'm going to do it right , and see if I can actually play this game or not . Well , that I , I guess that 's what I need to do is , is get some kind of lessons or something . Because I , my , my tee off is not bad , I mean I 'm , I 'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that it 's just , that , that initial tee . Yeah , what do you do when you 're putting ? That 's a good thing . That 's something I could learn actually . That 's when I do my worst . I finally get to the green and I think I 'm doing all , all fine and then , Just walking around the hollow and making sure there 's not really , you know , checking the ground and , and so forth , you know . Yeah . See how it 's going to break or whatever . Can you really see it though ? Yeah . What about the speed ? If you get , if you get down on the ground you really can . Can you tell ho , no- , but can you tell how , how fast you 're going to hit it ? Um , well , if you know if it 's up on a slope that you 've got to hit it not kill it but you 've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it 's , it 's , you know , because when it 's going up a hill it 's going to break in a direction . Yeah , but you can feel that ? Yeah . I do n't know I have , I can gi- , get it within like , you know , four or five feet or something but I do n't have enough field . Now I 'm T V watching . Yeah . They make you die at the hole every time . Yeah . Oh , it just dies and rolls in . I do n't know , But I , it 's hard for me . The , the , it 's , it 's like I said once I get up on the green I 'm fine , but that , that tee shot , uh , it , you know , when teeing off i- , I 'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground so it , it takes me awhile to get to the hole but , Once you 're there , you 're all set though . I 'm all set . We should play team golf then . I 'll get us there and you put it in . MUMBLEx that sounds good to me . I s- , oh , the T V golfers they do that . It takes them two to get there and two to get it in so it 's fifty percent . 

And me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in . Well , it , it , it usually takes me about probably two , two or three to get it there and , and then , that 's according to the hole and it ju- , uh , uh , maybe one or two putts . It 's , Yeah . according to where I 'm at on the green . 

That 's good . But the friends I play with , uh , they play all the time and , and they 're really good . Joe Pros ? Uh , they 're not Joe Pros but they , they golf in the high sixties low seventies so I guess they 're pretty good . That 's pretty good . For eighteen ? Yeah . For eighteen . Wow , that 's pretty good . Yeah . I 'm talking to the wrong guy . Your shitty golf is probably the best golf I 've ever seen . No , no , no , that 's not my golf . That 's my friends . Mine , mine , I 'm , I 'm usually in the eighties or nineties so I 'm , I 'm not good . If , when I 'm in the nineties I 'm feeling good . I 'm usually around a hundred . That 's my thing . Around a hundred . You know , I can hit a great drives and think I 'm going to do all awesome on this hole but it ai n't going to happen . Well , I either , teeing off I either slice it 

or I hook it ever single time and , and I alternate . Well , it 's a good thing with me I slice it every single time . That 's good . 

I aim ,
