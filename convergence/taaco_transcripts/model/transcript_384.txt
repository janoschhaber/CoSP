Hi , this is Donna Donahue . Hi , Donna . Hi . 

Ready to get started ? Uh , yeah , I think so . Okay . Sort of an interesting topic since I just got back from lunch here . Okay . Well , what did you have for lunch ? 

Oh , it was , uh , it was , I 'm an officer in the Air Force , Oh . Oh . Well , that 's interesting . Yeah . Okay . So our topic is , is food today , is that , Yeah . Okay . If you 're having a dinner party , what , what would you serve ? Okay , uh , do you want me to go first ? Sure . Okay . 

If I was having a dinner party I would probably , um , have some , um , some , uh , um , some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and , um , probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some , uh , uh , salsa and chips around and peanuts . And then I would have , um , let 's see . I usually have like a little theme when I have a dinner party Uh-huh . Um , I would have maybe , um , say if it was like Greek night or something -- Uh-huh . -- um , maybe , um , on the barbecue we 'd put , uh , cubes of lamb or I guess lamb used for Greek . And , um , like a shish kabob , Uh-huh . and , um , mushrooms and tomatoes and onions and then we 'd have , um , like a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar salad . Uh-huh . And , um , let 's see what else . Um , maybe some rolls and , um , I guess some , uh , some rice or something like that . How does that sound ? . Jeez , well , well , when is the party here ? . Yeah . Um , yeah , that would take some planning but , I do n't know 

being a , being the bachelor here that I am , I , I do n't think I 'd , I 'd be a- , b- , I mean it , it 's not a question of capability here to do something like that . It 's just there 's , there 's no motivation . 

That 's right . You know , I want to , I want to throw some charcoal on the grill and , and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that but , um , Well , that sounds good too . I have , um , I have three kids -- Uh-huh . -- so , um , when we have friends over I have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs 

and , um , usually we just have very plain kind of , you know , interesting , not very interesting meals . Uh-huh . Pizza and that all so once in a while when we do something like that it 's kind of fun , but it 's not a , Yeah . not a regular thing . Yeah . Now are we supposed to talk for about five minutes , it ? Yeah , that 's what they , they are shooting for here . Okay . Um , let 's see now wh- , okay , so you would have a barbecue wouldn- , Well , I live on a , I live on a lake here , Uh-huh . and , uh , so it , and then during the summertime it 's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors , Oh , sure . like that 's a little more a casual thing . But in mine the wintertime it 's not bad too because then I 've got a , a fireplace and a nice , nice house and all that so we , Uh-huh . Oh , that sounds wonderful . really good place to do entertaining like that . I just have n't , uh , really tried a whole lot but , uh -- Uh-huh . -- I do n't know , let 's see . I have had , well , one time I did have a dinner party . I served a , uh , uh , I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits , Uh-huh . and kind of southern , uh , southern food even though I 'm up here in New York , so . Oh , you are in New York right now ? Yeah . Oh . I 'm , I 'm in Texas . 

I did n't know this was all , from all over the whole country . Oh , yeah . Yeah , Oh , I see . it is . It 's , And I 'm fr- , originally from Long Island . Oh , no kidding ? Yes , and now where are you in New York ? Upstate . Oh , upstate . Rome . In , uh , Oh , okay . Griffins Air Force Base . Oh , okay . Is that where you , you are originally from around there ? Oh , okay . and , uh , been all over the place . Oh , wow . That 's interesting . Okay , 

let 's see . Um , well , I like to have , um , sometimes when I have a dinner party I 'll have , um , everybody bring something , Yeah . and that 's real interesting because then you get different , um , different kinds of foods and new recipes and , um , uh , sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like , Right . and get the recipe from them or whatever . And we are just getting interested in , in Mexican food because here in Texas they have lots of , Uh-huh . really good Mexican restaurants and , Sure . um , we 're , we 're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could , do you know what a fajita is ? Yeah . Yeah , Yeah . 

I 've been down to Texas a few times , Okay . and , uh , had , uh , the pleasure of their good Mexican , Yes . cuisine down there . They have some delicious , delicious things , and I , um , since I always make chicken burritos and just -- Uh-huh . -- take chicken breasts and you boil them , maybe like four chicken breasts , and you boil them until they are cooked . Uh-huh . Maybe like thirty minutes and then you debone them and , and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled and you take , um , s- , little bit , maybe two tablespoons of butter and a fr , in a big frying pan . And chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt ,
