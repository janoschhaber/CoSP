Okay . Do you have any children ? No . I do n't . You do n't . 

Do you ? Yes , I have , uh , one . A five year old daughter . Uh-huh . Did you ever have her in child care ? Yes , I do . 

She was , um , at a private , well , I stayed off work with her for little over of a year -- Uh-huh . -- when she was born . And then I had her at a private sitter for , I guess , two , two and a half years after that . And how did you choose that sitter ? Um , she was referred to me by a couple of people and she turned out to be wonderful . I could n't have asked for anything better , I do n't think . Yeah . I did n't want to s , send her straight to a day care . Right . And , even though she was that old , I still did n't want her to go to a day care . Yeah . And this lady , you would think it was her own . Really ? Yeah . She 's real good . 

It 's hard to find people like that . Yes . It is . And , um , now I have got her in a Montessori school . Uh-huh . And she 's really , really doing good and learning a lot . And , actually , I 've started working up there in the afternoons , too . So , 

Oh , yeah . Well , that 's neat . Y- , well , yeah . I guess . I 'm going to quit as soon as school , the school season 's over . 

But , uh , I really enjoyed being with her up there . I hate it for her , she has to stay that much longer , Yeah . but , Do they have classes for them during the summer , too ? Yeah . They , they go f- , uh , year-round , uh -- Huh . -- teach them . Now , in the summer they have like a lot of field trips . Yeah . There 's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one , and stuff like that . It 's a lot more lax . 

But , but they still go through all their , uh , curriculum as usual . What kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there ? Um , gosh . I ca , my husband and I both went . We kind of give her the third degree . Uh , good , I 'm glad to hear that . Yeah . Well , we went over to her house , so we told her , you know , pro- , well , we did n't tell her , we just told here we 'd be over that day . We did n't tell her when . 

So , that way I did n't think , y- , Yeah . you know , the house would be , y- , you know , cleaned or anything for me specifically . Right . And , um , she had a daughter , and I want to say her daughter was like six or seven , right around first , second grade . And , um , at the time she kept anoth- , one other child , um , about a four year old , I believe . But it was only like a part-time basis . So , we went over there and we questioned her about what she fed them and , um , what she did with them during the day and , um , you know , just how she treated them , how , how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and , Yeah . stuff like that . And , uh , we really seem to be pleased with her . And , um , , 

Did you , did you introduce your daughter to her before you made , Yes , your decision ? Oh , yes . And she still loves her to death . I , mean , when they see each other , you know , they just love each other to death . And she literally spent almost the entire amount that I paid her on my daughter . Really ? Either making her clothes or , Yeah . buying her things . MUMBLEx . So , we 're real , real lucky . But aft- , uh , so she stayed with her about , roughly two years , and she , um , she had to go back to work , they had some other expenses that came up so she had to go , I guess , get a real job . Yeah . Get a real job , full time . Yeah . 

So , uh , So , what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school ? Well , I checked a lot of places out , you know , the Kinder Cares and the , 

stuff like that . And , uh , I live in Garland . And , there 's this Montessori school that 's nearby and , um , it had been recommended by some friends of ours but , uh , it , it 's an older place . And so , I , uh , checked out all the new places that were near us and then I checked that place out and , uh , even though it was older , it was , it was real comfortable and , Uh-huh . I guess , kind of homey . Yeah . And they did n't just play all day long . You know , like , I noticed a lot of these other schools that I went and interviewed on , or interviewed at , um , they did a lot of play work and stuff . And then they , almost all of them had a Montessori section . Huh . And I thought , well , gosh , that must be pretty good , you know , if everybody 's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into , Yeah . into , Yeah . their school . And they made sure they pointed it out , you know . But after I looked at this place , and I took Randi with me , uh , I think just about to every place . One place I think I did n't take her . Uh-huh . And , I just kind of let her go , see , see what she felt like doing . Yeah . And that place , boy , if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them and , it 's hard to drag her away . So , I felt more comfortable at , That 's , that place . the true test . Yeah . Yeah . And she was real comfortable . And she has really , really done good . I , I , it 's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her . Yeah . But , she seems to me to be , you know , pretty quick and smart and she 's already reading and writing and stuff , That 's good . 

like that . And she just turned five last month . Huh , that , So , is good then . Yeah . I think so . I mean , I did n't want to rush school at her the whole time , but , No , especially we 're going to spend the next eighteen years , in school . Exactly . Exact- , I wanted , to quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months , because I know she 's going to have to face that . Yeah , really . 

And , oh , my God . Here we go , That 's right . you know . I just hate that , but , anyway . So , you do n't have any children . Do you have any l- , nieces or nephews then ? Yeah . Yeah . I have a nephew . He 's a little brat . He goes to a really crummy day school . My sister 's not real bright , so , but he , he 's always sick . I mean , he has always got some kind of , cold or something . And , I do n't know , 

I do n't think this place is a very good place for him . It 's just kind of convenient and she 's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else . Oh , really . Just easy to get them , Yeah . 

there and stu- , Exactly . Well , that 's a shame . Yeah . I do n't think she checks things out very well . Oh , really ? That 's , Which , scary . really surprises me . It is scary . Yeah . Yeah . I w , I was petrified . I know . I would be , too . I mean , that 's , uh , I do n't know , that 's just it . 

And that 's why I do n't mind paying more . Yeah . Um , I do n't know . I just feel m- , Too many horror stories out there that , Yes . you know . 

And that 's one reason I like working up there a little bit is , Oh , yeah . because I know what 's really going on . That 's right . I think that 's an ideal situation . Because you do n't know , uh , because like at her school , um , as soon as you drive up it 's got like a circular type drive . They sit 

and they have car callers and , and some kid goes out and gets the kid and , Yeah . it 's time to go . Huh . Well , at first that always kind of bothered me . I mean , not bothered me , but I thought , well , you know , I 'd like to see what she 's doing , you , Yeah . know . But now that I 'm there , I mean , it 's , it 's a lot more convenient because there 's so many kids that doddle . Uh-huh . You know , when their parents come , and it 's hard to get them out , and a lot of parents have places to go and -- That 's right . 

-- and things like that . And it 's late at night , so , you know , now it does n't bother me at all but , 

Is that where the , over there off of , like , I 'm not sure what the street is , is it off of , near Country Club , Yeah . and all , Sixty-six . That one that 's , yeah . set back in the woods ? Yeah . Yeah . I , I , That 's it . I 've seen the signs but I 've never actually seen the place itself , you , Yeah . know . It 's pretty , set far back , Right . 

off the road . Right . It w- , and that 's something I like , too , Yeah . because -- Definitely . -- a lot of those places are , like , you know the one over here on seventy-eight , Skaggs . Uh-huh . That little Kinder Care , whatever it is ? Yeah . You know , it 's right there on , which this is on a highway , too . But it 's set back , Right . enough to , Yeah . There 's a difference . I 'm scared , I would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out , or -- Uh-huh . -- or , if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could , Ye- , you know , go , Yep . in and get one . That 's right . Or , you know , or a car accident . Yeah . And , Yeah . that was one of the places I had checked out . And it was , it , it was brand new when I checked it out and , of course , it was beautiful and , Yeah . clean and smelled wonderful in there , but , you know , I , that , I did n't base everything on that . MUMBLEx . No , because that all wears off . 

That 's right . That 's exactly right . You get some kids in there and it 's , over quick . Yep . But , um , I 've been real pleased , knock on wood . I 'm scared to death her going to public school . Really ? I do n't know , I , w- , I do know why because -- I would be , too . -- you know , Yeah . d- , drugs and , Yeah . everything else and , Yeah . 

they talk about how soon they start that and that scares me . I know . 

It is scary . I mean , you 're just with them , Do they teach them in school right now where she 's at about drugs ? Yeah . 

They 've , um , they 've had police officers come in -- Good . -- and talk to them about it . But , of course , they still have no concept of , Right . what in the world drugs are , you , Right . know but , And what to do when they 're faced with it . Right . But I just think of her , you know , 

next year she 's going to be five , six years old in kindergarten , in same school with , you know , uh , I guess ten year olds . Is n't that , Yeah . six , sixth , sixth grade , you know , and that 's a big gap . It is . And that 's , uh , that , I can honestly see the peer pressure there . Uh-huh . 

And that , Oh , I can , just , see it , too . terrifies me to death . And stuff , those kids getting snatched and -- Uh-huh . 

-- I 'm , I 'm probably a little too over protective but , Nothing wrong with that . Well , nowadays you have to be . Yes . You do . If , 

I do n't , I do n't think there 's anything wrong with that . So , I at first thought , you know , when I did n't have kids , I was going , God , how can you be so protective ? You , Uh-huh . know but , it 's easy now . Uh-huh . Now you understand . Yeah . Definitely . That 's what I 'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say , when you have kids of your own , you 'll understand . That 's exactly right and I do . Uh-huh . But anyway . Well , are you ever , are you , b- , are you , are you married ? Yes . Are y'all planning on having kids ? Or , Well , that 's good . Yeah . Because they 're really neat . It 's just .
