Yeah , they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago . Well , they 've , uh , statewide raises , 

they raise ours it seems like constantly . We just , uh , passed a new one , uh , fortunately or unfortunately it does n't go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines . Oh , right Indianapolis got that , did n't they ? Right . And , uh , we had passed a , a provisional one that if , if it did , if they did locate here we would raise our taxes . But , uh , at least we thought we 'd get something back from that . Yeah . Uh , how do you feel about taxes ? Well , it seems like a big politics game 

like up here , last year , the governor was up for re-election so he said the budget was fine , the state did n't have any money and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money so they raised all our taxes . And now it 's election time again so they 're trying to lower them . Oh . So they 're just talk about lowering them but they never do , they just keep raising them . 

I 've never seen taxes really go down . Yeah , me neither . Well , actually they 're going to here because they did n't have a budget for so long so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year and they 're going to lower it for next year . Oh . I guess they figure they 're going to make up for all they did n't get when they should have had a budget . 

I hope they put that in writing . Yeah , yeah , they say they 're going to lower , but I 'll see . 

I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and , uh , that the rich are not paying their share and of course the poor ca n't afford it either , but , uh , I really feel like and , and I feel like , you know , I 'm a middle class person income wise anyway and , uh , I get tired of supporting the whole country . Yeah , so do I . I mean , I 'm a , a middle class barely , but , uh , I do n't think the rich are paying mo- , less , not enough , I think they 're paying too much . You think the rich are paying too much ? Yeah , 

I mean if you 're in the , the three , three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month , well , that 's ridiculous . Why bother working ? Well , I do n't know many rich that do n't have enough tax breaks to , I mean , I 'm talking about the really rich . 

Well , they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make . Right . That would be fair . Now I 'll go along with that . Yeah -- You know , -- no loopholes or anything . Everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever . Right . Now , I think that would be fair . Right . 

And I , you know , no , no ifs , ands and buts , you know , no big elaborate laws that say , uh , you know , call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review . It 's just , you know , you make this , you pay ten percent . If you make a hundred dollars , you pay ten percent , if you make a million dollars , you pay ten percent . Yeah , that 's the way our state tax is here . I think it 's pretty fair . Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal . Uh-huh . And , uh , they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate . Oh . So , and , and you withhold no matter what you do , they withhold what they 're supposed to and at the end of the year it 's not enough . Oh , great , so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out . Right , so now , you know , when you sign your W-Four form or whatever , W-Two -- Uh-huh . -- whatever that is , then they always say , do you want a extra amount for state . 

Which is ridiculous , but it 's been that way for the last probably ten years . Yeah , I guess you have to check yes or you come down to the end of the year and you do n't have it to give it to them . Right , unless you have a lot of deductions . Yeah . But , you know , if you have a lot of federal deduction , it ends up hurting you state wise . Really ? And you end up owing , you know , you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal and you 're going to owe fifteen hundred in state . Ouch . And , uh , it 's , it 's just ridiculous . But , I , I do n't know . I 've , they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property in , in Oklahoma county and that is a chunk . Yeah , I 'll say . I mean twenty-five percent increase . Y- , is ,
