think about this ? Uh , do you have children in school ? I do . 

Uh , I have two that are , uh , now just about ready to graduate from college -- Uh . -- but I also have two that are just entering school . So you see a big difference then in before and -- 

Uh , well -- -- now do you or , -- I think they 're just pushing them mu- , entirely to fast . A lot of testing ? Uh , well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade . Uh-huh . My son leaves the house at seven thirty and does n't get home until three o'clock . Uh-huh . And I think that 's such a long day for a kindergartner . I do too , I , oh , I think that 's awful . 

And , uh , I have a preschooler . Uh , I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten and I thought well how mature do you have to be . I know . What 's the new criteria , huh . And , uh , there is a , do you have the standardized testing now ? We have all kinds of testing and it 's over and over . It 's I T B S or , and , uh , just everything , everything . Yeah . And they test , test , test . I live in Plano actually 

and I do n't know if you 've heard of Plano but -- No . -- it 's a very transient community . A lot of people from everywhere , it 's just north of Dallas -- Uh-huh . -- and it 's grown in leaps and bounds . I , we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now . Oh . And most of them from other places . Yeah . Uh , J C Penney 's come down from New York and , of course , T I and Xerox from Rochester and we just , have lots of people from everywhere . Yeah . Lots of industry coming in , and it 's a very wealthy community . Uh , not that I am but other people seem , to be and I would love to know why but I mean they do . They have , you would like to know what they 're doing right . I , I would , I really would . I mean , they just have beautiful , beautiful homes and they have everything . The kids only wear name brand things to school and it 's one of these things , 

Oh me . Well that makes it hard for you , does n't it . Well it does , you know . It really does because I 'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now and -- Oh , me . 

-- uh , you know , it does . I mean , we do it to a point but -- Yeah . -- uh , not to where she feels different , but -- It 's hard to explain to them why you ca n't . -- some of them are very rich and so , uh , we just kind of have , everything here and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are . Right . And so I do n't know how much of it , is us and how much of it is Texas but the kids are expected to excel in , everything . 

Oh , dear . And it 's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody ca n't be first and they 're -- Right . -- expected to be . You know , their parents expect it , the teachers expect it , Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system -- Right . -- and if you read national surveys , they 're far from it . And so there 's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests . How about the kids . How are they coping with it ? 

Well , not very well . They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night 's sleep -- Huh . -- and eat right in the morning before , tests . I mean they make a big deal . To me , the paper should just be put on the desk that day and say just do this . Right . You know , I just feel they do better that way . Yeah . Rather than -- And , -- anticipating . Yeah . And , and I have older children too that now are out of high school and they 've always done this here . I mean it 's always been the same but it is , it 's getting worse and worse , is more pressure for everything . And I just think it 's really awful and I , I 'm with you on that . You do n't hear too many people say this , but I think it 's a very long day . Oh , it is . And my feeling is that , you know , you 're only a kid once , and you do n't want to -- That 's right . -- spend your whole life in school . My son said that , came home and he said , he said Mom , all we do is work . Uh-huh , uh-huh . We hardly ever play and , And I do n't think that 's right . I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system . Oh , likewise . I do n't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons , gymnastics , piano . Right . I would like to see those things included in our school system -- Would n't that be great . -- because I think we should have well-rounded kids -- Uh-huh . -- not just book smart kids . Right . And so I just find this a real problem . I think if they 're going to be there all day , they should find time . One of my daughters , once , was out of school with Mono in her junior year I think it was . And she had a home teacher for like four hours a week and when she went back in six weeks , she was ahead . So what -- Is that right ? -- does that tell you ? It tells you there 's a whole -- Oh , my gosh . -- lot of wasted time . Oh , my gosh . And they could be using this time better . Well , for example , in my son 's kindergarten . They 're really finished at lunch time . After lunch , they have some , uh , I 'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch , and then they have naps or rest period . Uh-huh . And , uh , I think either send them home or do something -- That 's a very long day for kindergartners . -- a little more interesting . I agree . But I think that working parents have kind of demanded this . I would n't be surprised . You know , because they do n't , they do n't want to send them to daycare . I doubt if they would say it was too long . That 's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day . Uh , do you have the before school care , at your school and the after school care ? We have them at one school like ,
