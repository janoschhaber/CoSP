Okay . Uh , so your , you , I guess you 're probably in the same , uh , same situation uh , we 're in . We 're kind of past having to provide child care . Our , our kids are grown up . We do n't have any grandchildren yet . But , uh , uh , they 're , Uh-huh . 

How old are your children ? Uh , one 's twenty-six and the other is , uh , twenty , twenty-one . Uh-huh . So they 're , uh , uh , Well , they 're going to be getting there . They 're , they 're getting there . You know , there 's no -- Yeah . -- no , no prospects right away for anything to happen . U- , uh-huh . 

Oh , I see . But , uh , I have , uh , five children . I have a eighteen year old son . The rest of my girls are like twenty-three , twenty-six , twenty-eight , and twenty-nine . Uh-huh . And I have three granddaughters right now . Oh . And , uh , I , uh , one 's in Iowa . Uh-huh . And , uh , she 's , she 's a teacher and what she does is she , teaches at a preschool . Oh , okay . And , and so she kind of , and they let her bring her , her little daughter in for free . Uh-huh . And then , so MUMBLEx but she just works part-time . Uh-huh . Then I have another daughter in , uh , Bountiful , Utah and she has to work full-time and it 's just tearing her apart . She has a private baby-sitter . Yeah . And , uh , the baby just screams . I mean , the baby is like seventeen months and she just screams . Uh-huh . Well even if she knows that they 're fixing to get ready to go over there . They 're not even there yet -- Uh-huh . 

-- you know . Yeah . It 's hard . We , And , and then I have my , uh , uh , I have a seven month old granddaughter and , uh , her mother stays home and she , they live , they live with us . You know , in , as Orange County -- Uh-huh . -- is really expensive . Uh-huh . They live with us and so , of course , we love it . Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time . But , uh , uh , she just , uh , she used to work in pre , in the preschool and , and , and child care and she says after working in there and , and , you know , here she was a provider but , you know , there 's only so much one person can do . Yeah . She said it 's so awful . She said she 'll never put her child in a , in a , in a preca- , in a p- , in a preschool . Uh-huh . I 'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere . Huh . But it 's really , it 's really , really very difficult and , Yeah . What did you do when your kids were growing up ? Were you , Well , when , when the , uh , the first , uh , ten years , see first ten or twelve years , I stayed home . Uh-huh . And , uh , then after that I , I went to work . Uh-huh . And , uh , uh , uh , a couple of times I just , uh , uh , you know , th- , then I had one job and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job . And then , and then like about , later I , I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter . Supposed to be good , uh , recommended person from the church and I knew her personally . She had two kids of her own and everything . 

But I quit my job because I could n't stand how she was taking care of my child . Uh-huh . I mean , first of all , uh , her children were sick all the time . So when my son stayed over there , he got sick . He got sick , yeah . Same thing , same thing that the , her kids had , right ? Right . Well , And so , uh , we did n't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock . Then he , she 'd take my son and her daughter over t- , to kindergarten . But s- , that day , uh , I was saying now he , he 's sick . And she goes well , she goes , he has the same thing that all my kids have . That 's what he got , you know . Goes , well , okay , so it 's not like he 's going to infect her kids . But then what happened was , is , I said , uh , he just threw up and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said well she 'll keep him home and he 'll probably just sleep anyway . Well , you know , what that woman sent her , sent him to kindergarten . She sent him to kindergarten . As soon as he went there , the teacher took one look at him and he threw up again and they put him in the nursery , uh , they put him in the nurse 's office . Guess so , yeah . And then what happened was , is , you know , they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter . Called her and they said , uh , that he 's sick . Well she was n't home . Huh . I mean her , all her kids were sick but she was n't home , right . And her , and her , her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick . Now why did n't he , why did n't she keep him home with her ? No , she did n't do that . So , it got to the point where he 's , he 's supposed to get out of , uh , kindergarten like about two thirty . And I had to leave work . It was , it was five o'clock in the evening and I found out he was still there at school . And they were calling me and they said somebody 's got to pick him up . And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up , she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school . I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff . And he had a hundred and four fever . They could n't , uh , give him anything because they 're not allowed to at school and everything . Right . I was so furious . I , I quit that job and I stayed home for awhile longer . Then I went and got a , uh , a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better . Yeah , a little more flexibility . You can come and go . Yeah , but , uh , I have n't had any good , really very good experience with child care . Yeah . 

When , when our kids were small we had a couple of , uh , good , good women who , uh , would often c , uh , get them to come to the house .
