Okay . So , uh , what do you think about it ? Well , um , I guess I , I 'm more concerned about public safety than I am about the , um , the concern for the private , uh , the idea of , Privacy . preserving privacy for , Right . the individual , um , because I ca n't really see why anyone , um , who has nothing to hide would object . Well , there is always the , uh , the possibility , even remote as it is , of , uh , of mistaken , uh , of , That 's , of course , that is certainly true , Yeah . yeah . And see that bothers me . I 'm , I 'm a , I mean , I 'm , I 'm very much for drug testing , Uh-huh . uh , I really am . 

I mean , I 'm going , I 'm going to take the negative side just for a second , Sure . just to do it . Um , see , I have to take , uh , medication for a , uh , for , for kidney transplant . Uh-huh . And I 'm going to be taking that the rest of my life . Now , you , Sure . I do n't know how that 's going to affect , uh , If you had to have a drug test ? Right . Yeah . 

I mean I have n't had one yet . Um , T I , I work for Texas Instruments -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- and , and , uh , we , you know , we do have the random drug testing but I 've missed it so far . But I mean , it , in the back of my mind , it always bothers me . And what happens if it , you know , if it , if they catch it , they think that I 'm , you know , I 'm on drugs and they send me and , and have me , uh , you know , go through this , this , Checked out or whatever . thing , you know , yeah . 

But it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that . Um , I agree that , that some innocent person might be victimized , Uh-huh . by a false test , but I would think that , um , that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that . For example , that one , uh , positive would not be , uh , accepted as an automatic , um , reason for whatever they might be going , Right . to do if they found a positive , uh , dismissal or treatment or whatever , but that , that what it would do is it would trigger , perhaps , uh , one or two more stages where further tests could be ta- , uh , done . Uh-huh . Because , um , there are , there must be people like you , or in other circumstances , that could come up with , with , uh , false positives for certain kind of drugs . On the other hand , um , I think there 's certainly some professions that ought to be tested -- Oh , yeah . -- because of the , of their responsibility for the public welfare , and certainly people in , uh , industries , well , the transportation industry , Uh-huh . for spe- , uh , you know , specifically . Oh , yeah . But , um , in many , many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs , it 's not even going to effect anybody but his , uh , you know , himself and his own family , perhaps , um , depending on the kind of drug he might be on . Right . But , um , and eventually that 's going to show up anyway in the way he works , Uh-huh . and so on . But there 's so many things that it would make a difference . I guess I , I , uh , I would not want to have anyone in my family , uh , victimized by someone who , you know , a , a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that , who , um , you know , had n't been tested . Right . Well , I , you know , I 'm , like I said , I 'm , I 'm very much pro testing , um , and , and this is why . Yeah . Uh , number one is I , I 'm , I 'm kind of , I know this sounds like a slogan for the government , but I , you know , we are in a war against , Yeah . drugs . I mean -- Sure . -- it 's , it 's horrible . I mean , you do n't know whether the person sitting next to you -- Uh-huh . -- anywhere is on drugs or not , Uh-huh . and it takes some drastic steps at this point . And I think , personally , the drastic step has to be that , um , that you ca n't work if you continue taking drugs . Yeah . I mean , it 's as simple as that . I mean , make it so , Make it difficult enough . Well , make it , uh , ma- , not necessarily difficult , but make it so that it 's not glamorous . Yeah , yeah . I mean , it 's glamorous taking drugs , or at least it seems that way . Yeah , according to what you , Yeah . you hear . The people who , um , have serious problems , I mean , we have , um , really I guess we 're kind of lucky . We really only know of one , uh , young man who , uh , who 's a fam- , they go to our church , Uh-huh . and it 's the son and so on , and he was friends with my children um , and he 's really the only one that I know of personally who got himself really messed up , um , ha , having been involved with drugs . But I know of a number of other people who have , you know , gotten all messed up . Uh-huh . Most of these are young people . I work in the education system and so I have a little more contact with that . But , um , the effect that it 's had on this young man 's life is so dramatic that it 's heartbreaking -- Uh-huh . -- and he may never really be a productive member of society . But sadder than that , he may never be able to have a normal , happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are , are almost uncontrollable . I mean , he , he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that , you know , he , he 's not sure if he 's going try to commit suicide or not . Huh . I mean , he 's , you know , he 's so messed up . Right . And , um , this was a nice , sweet , young man who , teenager , you know , and he 's now a young man about twenty , I guess , who , um , just got really down the wrong path . Right . And , uh , you know , I do n't know that , that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing . But seeing what drugs did to him makes me see , makes me realize what it could do to people , you know , in the work force as well . Uh-huh . Um , it 's horrible . Well , then , 

let 's , let 's answer the second half of the question . What limits ought to be put on it , do you think ? Well , the limits , uh , uh , would , I think , have to do with what I 'd alluded to before , that there needs to be a further , um , that , that one positive on a drug test , Uh-huh . would not constitute , uh , dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might , uh , have set up for those who genuinely have a problem . Uh-huh . In other words , there needs to be , um , more than , Treatment before for dismissal type thing . Pard- , yes , right , Yeah . there needs to be more than one test , and there needs to be some , some measure of , uh , certainty before anything drastic happens . Uh-huh . There are lots of things that are involved there , um , such as , perhaps , insurance -- Uh-huh . -- uh , you know , denial of insurance for someone , um , and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this , um , that would , that , you know , it would be unfair , and people who are on medication , for example , or , um , even people who might be of the gay community , and I 'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society , but , um , I think that there does n't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination -- Right . because it makes a bigger problem . Um , so it seems to me that , that , um , there needs to be some ground , you know , some rules -- Uh-huh . -- that protect . I 'm not sure , though , when we talk about what rules , if any , that we should say , well , certain segments should not have to be tested . I really do n't see why , 

Personally , I think that 's what I was about to say -- And , yeah . -- is that everyone needs to be tested . Yeah . I do n't , It , you know , 

I do n't know why it would be , you know , uh , bad to test just every- , and it may be , you know , it 's not feasible to do everyone , but certainly random testing , the fact that people know that , that they , That it could happen . Yeah , Uh-huh . would be some measure of protection . But the bottom line is that , that if , if you 're going to stay clean and straight , then , um , you 're , you 're going to do that because you want to . Right . Really . Well , there 's , yeah , there , there 's going to be some measure of incentive , uh , reward or whatever , but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want . Yeah . So I , I 've got to agree with that . So , um , That 's very true . Um . Well , it sounds like we agree , anyway . Yeah , I think so . I think we , I think we did pretty good . Yeah . Well , all right , well , uh , I guess that 's about it . I guess if that 's all we 've done and I guess we 've talked long enough . All right . It was nice talking to you . It was , it was talk , nice talking to you , too . Okay , bye-bye . All right , bye-bye .
