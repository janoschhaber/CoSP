I said Arlington , Texas because the other day , I was talking with somebody and he was in Arlington , Virginia . Oh , no . Yeah , that 's the only one I 've got now for this area . Oh , gosh , oh , gosh . Well , anyway , we 've got a easy subject . Yes , we do . You go ahead first , if you 'd like . Okay , let me think here . Favorite , I have n't been watching much T V lately . Yeah , 

you know -- I used to . -- you get so busy . Yeah , I have , uh , I have one favorite soap opera . I still watch and I tape because I 'm not home . Oh , . And , uh , let 's see , that 's GENERAL HOSPITAL , and then , uh , at night , uh , I do n't , uh , when I sit down , I do n't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock -- I know . -- when my kids get in bed and , and , uh , then I watch , uh , what do I watch at nine o'clock . Let 's see , oh , well , Tuesday nights I guess , we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like . Right . And , uh , Are they little ? I have a seven year old and a ten year old . Yeah , they 're pretty young . And , uh , so we usually catch , uh , FULL HOUSE , and , uh , what 's the one comes on after that . It 's a new one , uh , , I do n't know , my kids are older -- Uh-huh . 

-- so I do n't , I do n't know some of those shows now , like I used to . Yeah , yeah . Uh , other than that , uh , oh , gosh . I watch KNOTS LANDING on Thursday nights , for pure entertainment , nothing else . Right . Yeah . Well I , I like the comedies . They 're just light , too . I have to watch MURPHY BROWN I really like , 

Oh , now that is a good one . I make a point of -- That is . -- that . Yeah , if I 'm home on Mondays , then I , I definitely watch her . 

I love that and I really like COACH . I think it 's , when it 's good , it 's just a scream . Yeah , yeah , well , he 's a good actor . He really is good . Well , he 's probably playing himself . Half the time you see these people on an interview show , they 're , they act just like they do in their parts . Yeah , yeah . He , I saw him on JOHNNY CARSON once and he acted about the same . Oh , God . 

Well , he could very well be . Yeah , and , uh , So , do you watch much T V , or , Well , I watch more now because , well I , I had been going to school for years and have really been too busy -- Uh-huh . -- but this semester I 'm only taking one course and so I see MURPHY BROWN and COACH and THE WONDER YEARS . I just make a point of seeing those . Now , I never see that . 

Well , I 've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show . Oh , it 's fabulous . Really , you should never miss that . It , they are just gems of shows . Oh , nice . I mean , they really , fabulous in every way . What , now what night is that on now ? 

Oh , that 's Wednesday at , uh , seven thirty . Wednesday at seven thirty , oh , okay . Yeah , Wednesdays I , I go to church choir , so . Oh , yeah . That 's my one night out and about , so , Sure , yeah , well , maybe , maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime . Yeah , I should get him to do that . Just so you get the idea . It would n't take , Because I know , Would n't take much to get hooked on those . Yeah , yeah , uh-huh . So , so , I watch those . Are there any new ones this year that came out that you like or , Well , you know , I have n't , oh , yeah , we started watching NORTHERN EXPOSURE . Well , it 's not really new , but it 's still kind of new . Uh-huh , uh-huh . 

How 's that ? I have n't seen that . I like it a lot . It 's real different . In fact , they never thought it would be a hit . Huh . I mean , they 'll have some things in there that almost , almost , you know , like supernatural , or something , 

you know , I mean , somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does or , I mean , it sounds weird , but , it 's very , uh , unique show and very well done . Huh . Excellent actors . 

I 'll have to watch for that . I , I guess we just , it came on after something we used to watch -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- and I guess we just kept sitting there and then now we make a point of watching . I ca n't take all these shows on because next semester I 'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television . Uh-huh . Well then , it will be mostly reruns , I guess . Yeah , yeah . And by the end of February , the way they do it nowadays . Gosh . But , uh , Well , we used to watch a lot of DESIGNING WOMEN , but , uh -- Yeah . -- I have n't seen that much lately . Yeah , I 've seen that . Since they got rid of , uh , Delta Burke and , uh -- Was she the , was she the best one ? -- brought on the new ones . Was she the best one on that old show ? Oh , she was just funny . Really ? She was really funny . And her character was good . I do n't know that it was her in particular -- Right , right . -- but just the character . So , uh , Yeah , 

they had a big fight on that show , did n't they ? Yeah , yeah . They were all accusing each other of everything in the world . Oh , that was awful and who knows still , what ha , really happened , you know . 

Well , I know , gosh , you never will , probably . Yeah , yeah , so , Well , I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable . Oh , I know . I do n't have cable . Now I told MUMBLEx , no , 

we do n't have that station either , so , uh , I have n't been able to catch any of that , but just what little we caught on the news . It 's just as wild as any soap opera , from what I hear on the news . Oh , I know it . And I think he 's guilty as the devil . Well , I do n't see how he could n't be , you know . 

I know , what 's in it for her . There 's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that . Yeah , 

that 's right . Because you know they tear you to shreds , especially those rich -- Oh , and they said -- -- high powered lawyers . -- this lawyer is unbelievable . Um . But , they said she held up so well yesterday . 

I know , everybody was saying that and then , in the paper said it so , Yeah . It should be interesting . 

Oh , God . Well , the NATIONAL ENQUIRER says . I was reading that in the supermarket line . I never have the nerve to buy the thing . Uh , Oh , shoot , well , do you watch any , uh -- 

Says he , -- any sports or anything like that or , No , I do n't care anything about that . Because I do n't either . 

I ca n't , I ca n't watch it on T V , so , I like the ice skating , you know , occasionally , some ice skating will come on , on a Sunday or during the Olympics -- Uh-huh . -- I always watch that . I think it 's so beautiful . Yeah , I like to catch the gymnastics sometimes , too . 

Oh , yeah , that 's good .
