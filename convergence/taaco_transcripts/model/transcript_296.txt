Well , the weather has been , certainly has been hot and it 's been humid . I do n't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high for , uh , this late into , uh , well , it 's not really late into the summer , but the , the humidity has hung around all of June . Yeah . Are you native to this area ? No , I grew up in Michigan , Oh , okay . But I 've been , I 've been in Texas for fifteen years . Uh-huh . So , uh , but , you know , I know the summers get hot but -- Uh-huh . -- it certainly , uh , this humidity has just really hung on there . Yeah . Yeah , it seemed like , well , you know , last year was so strange having all those heavy , heavy rains in April 

and this year we really did n't have heavy rains until May . Kind of like pushed the season back a little farther and now it 's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity and it just tried to rain , I mean , I was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago and it was trying to rain which -- Yes . -- seems strange to have it raining in July . Normally we do n't have too much , uh , humidity or , or , uh , rainy time when it 's past June . Oh , that 's right , that 's right . I can remember it not , it 's really August that it happens . You get those great big cracks in the ground where it 's been so dry -- Right . -- and it just gets so dry and , the earth opens up . I can remember the first year I moved here -- Uh-huh . -- and it did n't rain , I moved here like in late August and it did n't rain from August until December and , I went home and told it just does n't rain in Texas . I mean it was great after growing up in Michigan and not , and al- , you know , every day was cloudy , almost every day was cloudy and I , you sort of forget how much it did rain and coming here and then it did n't rain , it was just wonderful . Well , yeah , see I , I lived in , uh , Ohio mainly . I lived in , uh , Pontiac just a little while before I came -- Oh , yeah . 

-- down here and , you know , so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities , you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather . It might rain on your little parade . 

That 's right , that 's right . You know , and here it was like , pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime and you really did n't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out . Yeah . You could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do . That 's right . What part of Michigan were you living in ? 

Oh , I grew up in Dearborn -- Okay . -- which is a suburb of , of Detroit . Yeah , yeah . You probably know where that is because I know where Pontiac is , Anyway , yeah . What brought you down here ? 

Oh , a teaching job . So you teach in Plano schools ? Yeah , I did , I did for a while , uh-huh . So , I 'm home with , home with two children , Oh . So , Okay . New career . Okay . New career but , uh , anyway , so that kind of , uh , 

well , I had been down here to visit so I MUMBLEx school and said hey , let 's , you know , find a place that has a nice job and , uh , that 's how it worked out . Well , yeah , 

I think a lot of people were , uh , leaving Michigan all about the time I came here in the early eighties and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus . Oh , yeah . You know , the , the little joke about , will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light . Oh , well , it 's a nice place , you know , I mean it 's , it 's a nice , that 's a nice place , though . Well , you know , I , I said I lived in , uh , the Pontiac . I did n't live in the city of Pontiac , I lived to the west of it . Uh , I forget the , the county , but you know where all the lakes are around there . Okay , sort of . I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes . It was real close to where I worked . It was only like four miles to work and it was wonderful being on the lake like that . You know , in the summer , you feel like you 're , you know , on a vacation all the time because you 're right on a lake and everybody 's , you know , out enjoying the water and such , and , uh , in the winter time the lakes froze over , you could still kind of go sledding and such out there but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes . There 's lots of really small ones out there . Yeah . You know , like maybe a mile , two long . Yeah . That 's enough to , uh , do some boating -- That 's right . -- and it was lots of fun . That 's right . Um . 

Which is , well , I think it 's , I think it 's toward Ann Arbor , so it 's probably out in that direction , but that 's the only one I probably could name -- Uh-huh . -- after all these years so , Yeah , yeah . But , uh , But it was , yeah , just lots of little lakes and , of course , it was , you know , a little more expensive to live on the lake , but I just thought that was grand . 

And I think a lot of people did n't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them , but there was quite a few lakes all around there . It seemed like , it was almost like you were living on an island there was so much water around where I was . I said I was n't close to downtown Pontiac , I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from , from the city limits and it was really nice out there . Yeah . We had , uh , Pine Knob -- Oh . -- you know , to go skiing -- Right . -- and stuff . Right . So there were things around there . Really was pretty nice . Sure , sure , and d- , is n't that where they have a summer music festival there , too ? Right , right in the summertime they have musicals there and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope . 

That 's right , that 's right . I know , we used to , we , we did n't do a lot of it , but we did . Yeah , yeah . We did , so those are always fun . And Alpine , was it Alpine was another ski slope -- Uh-huh . -- that we went to , Uh-huh , uh-huh . It was nice . I always tell people that in the winter we use , we used to , uh , my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on , you know , make a pond in the backyard for us . Oh , yeah , yeah . So but , uh , you know , we probably did some ice skating on it , but then it chipped , chipped and , you know , it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven so , Yeah , yeah . We used to have a Christmas time , uh , some of our relatives would come up from Alabama , 

and I think most times we would have snow around Christmas and the kids when they were young would just go nuts . Yeah . You know , because they were from Alabama where it never snowed -- Oh . -- and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it , you know , eternally . Oh . Oh , right , right . 

If only it would make nice snow here in Texas , we 'd be okay at Christmas time . My first winter here , I , I came down in , uh , early eighty-two and there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December be- , couple days before Christmas . It lasted only a few hours , like -- Yeah . -- by noon it was gone . Yeah . And I remember getting up and somebody telling me , hey , better wait to go to work because the roads are all , you know , snow . And I was laughing , going yeah , right , that 's a good practical joke , ha ha . They said , no really , there 's snow and there was , but a very short time and the weather got warm so quick -- Yeah . -- it just melted it all away . Yeah , yeah , I know . Course , when we get an ice storm , that 's not too much fun . No , that 's not fun either , 

so , uh , I , I just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets so , But , uh , well we have , our house is kind of on a little hill , so , uh , we get the sled out and , uh , the kids go down the hi- , the hill on the sleds when it 's icy , I mean they just go down the ice . Yeah . And if it 's cold , we say , okay , out you go . I think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there . 

Oh , yeah . I think it 's fun , even the couple of ice storms I 've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit . I mean , sometimes the ice is pretty bad , but if you get on the , the , uh , grassy kind of part , you get a little bit of traction , you know , not slip and fall . I mean , first ,
