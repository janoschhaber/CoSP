All right , well I have a lot of different teams that I like to , to keep in touch with , of course , Texas Rangers being one of them , I mean , uh , you know , you ca n't live in Dallas without , you know , Well what are the others ? Well , uh , I originally came from Saint Louis , so , uh , the Saint Louis Cardinals are one , uh , I moved to Kansas City , see I have , I have a tendency to , a , adopt teams when I wen , go to a tea- , uh , go to a town . Well it 's helpful . Yeah , so , uh , I lived in Kansas City for a couple years and I adopted the Royals , I lived in Houston for two and a half years so I adopted the , uh , uh , the Houston Astros , so I mean , you know , I 've got quite a few . Well do you keep up with the statistical stuff ? No , I do n't , I do n't get into that too much , eve- , every once in a while , I will keep in , in touch , with maybe , like who 's in the top five of hitting , or something like that but I do n't get into , you know , how many errors somebody has or things like that . Well there 's , there 's a guy on , that was on MUMBLEx show that I listen to going to work in the morning -- Uh-huh . 

-- who does , uh , uh , it 's essentially trivial statistics -- Uh-huh . -- but they 've got a st- , it 's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games . 

I 've heard of that one . And apparently the Rangers last year , won a lot of one run games . Well I did n't know that , that 's supposed to be a real good statistic , uh . Well , it , it , it is but it 's the , it 's , it 's a reverse indicator . Well that 's true , they do n't have the offense to , uh , to get out , or to have the , the more runs , so . Well what the , what the argument is and it , it , it , it 's one of these statistical , gee , how can you draw a conclusion from it , but they find that , tha- , tha- , there 's a connection between that and how they do in Spring training the following year . Uh-huh . And , uh , it 's strangely enough , it 's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year . Huh . Which means that if you have a good year winning one ru- , one run games that the following year , you 'll have a bad year . And they , they 've got , um , they 've looked at I think twenty-three teams , uh , and , and , the , uh , statistics are something like twenty-one out of twenty-three . It was , 

which means the Rangers are going to have a terrible year , I , uh , Which I was kind of leaning toward anyway , to tell you the truth . Well , I mean , and it 's , uh , uh , I do n't know , what do you , what do you think of Incaviglia 's loss . 

I kind of think it was necessary , I mean , I , i- , i- , I do n't , I 'm not a , a big , um , pure power hitter anyway . I mean , I do n't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time . I mean , uh , I think that , uh , that a player ought to hit a home run if he 's got the pitch to do it , but when you get two strikes on you , you have a tend- , you know , you should , you know , shorten your swing a little bit , you know , if it 's a perfect shot , go for it , but I mean , you know , the strike outs were a big problem for him , and , uh , plus supposedly what I heard , he was not much of a team player anyway , so . 

Well it , it 's an interesting concept , though , when you look at , uh , of , of how baseball , how apparently , I was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him . And , uh , and the point of , of , I guess , I do n't understand the , the strategy of how baseball works , but it seems that , you know , they can sign him tomorrow , Uh-huh . and he could go in the team the next day , and , and , and they put him in the lineup and he hits a home run and all of a sudden he becomes a hero . Yeah , well that 's true . And , and all he has to do is hit the ball , I mean , you 're not , a- , and all he has to do is one , you know , hit it once . It does n't , he can , he can stri , he can swing a couple times , MUMBLEx if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can . Right . It 's an interesting , uh , an interesting concept of , of how they do it . But I agree with you I think that , I think that 's part of what , uh , baseball needs more of . I , uh , I , I guess what bothers me is , is that when you go , um , you wait and wait and wait and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run and that 's all the game is . I 'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people , Yeah , well there 's , there 's another point to that too . 

They said the , that um , that he was horrible at , uh , at batting with , with men on base . Now having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you , you know , gives you run , obviously . Yes . But I mean if you ca n't do it with men on base , there 's something definitely wrong , um , you know , you , you 've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs , you know , to , to be able to , uh , score enough runs to be able to win in these , uh , in this day and age , so . Yeah , well how do you think the Royals are going to do ? I think the Royals will do okay . They have , they have several pitchers that had badly years last year and they are , they 're these , uh , cycle pitchers , they , they pitch one year bad , one year good , one beer bad , one year good . Saberhagen has won , uh , supposedly the Cy , I think he won Cy year , uh , two out of three years , and , uh , you know , so he 's very much due for a good year . Well are they going to beat , are they going to beat Oakland ? Well now see that 's a good question , 

I , that 's , I do n't know how Oakland 's going to react to being , uh , swept in the World Series last year . They could very easily , uh , take that as a challenge . Which is the way most teams nat- , you know , naturally do . Yeah . Uh , and , and , just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them , so , Well I go to Saint Louis from time to time and I watch , I , I watch their sports up there and they 're , Uh-huh . uh , they 're certainly intense about the Cardinals they , Oh yeah , baseball is their , is their life up there like football is down here I think . Y- , did you actually live in Saint Louis ? I lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis , yeah . Ye- , everybody does , right . Yeah , that 's true too , . I think that 's all that they have . I had a friend from college that lives in , uh , MUMBLEx it 's well , I should say on the west side , I mean everything 's on the west side . Manchester ? Uh-huh . Uh , out that way , Um . and I went and visited him , but anyway , it is interesting . Well how are the Cardinals ? Do you still keep up with them , or someth- , Yeah , oh yeah , I , I definitely do , in fact I 've got family that still lives up there . Um , from what I hear from everybody up there , they 're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go . But I 've been following Spring training and they 're like one of the best teams in spring training so far . Well is that a good indicator ? That , well it can be . It , it really kind of depends on , on , um , what they were , you know , what they were looking for . In other words , if , if in Spring cra- , training they were looking at all their kids , like a lot of them do , um , then it really does n't give you any indication . But if they were , uh , playing the people that they 're going to play , then that might be pretty good indication , so , you know , it 's , it 's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just , you know , come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring crani- , training and then gone on a , you know , fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so , You know what I think is remarkable is , uh , it seems that what you really need to do to win though , is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have , have , have real breakthrough years . Exactly , yeah . And , and the question is how do you forecast that , You ca n't . 

if you had to , if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series , I mean it would be really tough . Right , th- , I think the best thing that you can do is go with , um , the players that are , that have the talent to do the best years . And , um , that they had n't had these , uh , gigantic , uh , career years yet and , Yeah . and just kind of assume that , you know , so- , one of them is going to break through eventually , so . And I , I think they said the Reds , um , this last year , I 'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years . Yeah . You know , and , and so they may be even be , better this year . Well , well when are the Rangers going to come through th- , 

Uh , that 's a good question . I , the Rangers have a , have a pitching problem and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question . They 're doing the right thing , though , uh , they are going with their farm system . They 're letting their farm system , uh , build up and stuff like that and , Well is there enough money , that 's part of it , I , uh , that was part of Skip Bayless ' argument . Uh-huh . 

I do n't know if you read Skip Bayless , but -- No . -- a , a local commentary and , Uh-huh . his argument is that uh , the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to , to bring in the big dollars . 

Um , that 's probably true . Would you , would you agree with that ? Well considering what I 've seen in the last , uh , you know , two seasons , I 'm beginning to agree with that , yeah . But I mean , you do n't have to spend the big money , as far as I 'm concerned to , uh , to win . You just have to spend it if it 's necessary . Uh . In other words if you 've got a player on your team who 's helping your team , then keep him there . Do n't let him go away . Yeah . And I think that 's really what 's been hurting , uh , the , uh , Rangers . Well did n't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their -- Oh yeah , they , they spent more money , -- pitching staff . 

last year than any other team in the , in the league and they were , you know , toward the bottom of the league . Uh , so it 's like I said spending money does n't guarantee you , uh , winning a pennant . Yeah . It really does n't , so . Well and that , I think that 's maybe part of it that , that the , um , and it , you know , if I owned the team . I think you 'd like them to do well but the question of losing big , big money that what , did , did , did Steinbrenner actually make money on the , Uh , you got me . 

I , you know , I think that there 's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan ca n't go and once you do that , you lose everything , I mean . Well it 's , it , it , yeah , it 's a little bit like any other sport , you know . When it starts costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , you know , I mean , I , I guess as we get older , i- , you 're probably going , if , if you , if you compare to go to a , a sport , a , a 

say you go to a rock concert , Uh-huh . or , or even a performance , a , an opera or the symphony or something , uh , if , you know , i- , but how , how often do you do that . Right . An I , I , I would , I would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there , you know , several times a , That , that 's the whole point . There are so many games in , in a year that they 've got to have repeat customers . Yeah . They ca n't afford not to , and , you know , that 's one of the things that I think Saint Louis has done , um , I mean , their , you know , their ticket prices are , you know , kin- , I guess as high as anybody else 's but what , somehow or another they , attract , uh , so many people from , som- , I mean they 're a , it 's a small market and yet they attract as many if not more than most , uh , uh , most , other cities , so . Yeah , but do n't you think there 's a , there , there are older fans there . I , I do n't mean older , um , you know , the fact that , that it 's , it 's a better established and that the , the city is , is , is more , of a ...
