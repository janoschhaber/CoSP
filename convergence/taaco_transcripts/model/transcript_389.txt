Uh , I guess I 've always kind of liked golf . I , I worked on a golf course at , at one time and that 's how I picked up golf . And , uh , I do n't know it 's just a , kind of a challenging game . It sure is . I play at least three times a week . Uh-huh . I 'm on it , I have n't gotten the chance lately though to play . 

I 'm trying to get back into it . Uh , so , uh , I got to start all over again . It 's not like riding a bicycle . You do tend to , No . forget . Well , I 'm one of those rare left-handed golfers . Oh . Yeah . And I do enjoy playing . 

What is your handicap ? Right now it 's three . Okay . Uh , I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago . It 's probably up there to twenty now if I MUMBLEx to start again . Well , if you play with some consistency though , you can get it right back down . Yeah . Yeah . I have got to try and get out there . I , I know with our , our long winters I , I enjoy watching it . I do n't know if it 's just because I like the game or I just like to , to see the warm weather . Uh , well , we can usually play here year around . Sometimes in January it 's not too comfortable to play . Uh-huh . But there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play , and I 'm pretty much addicted to golf , so . I get out there one way or the other . Yeah , that 's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter you almost have to relearn every spring to , to get back out . It 's a good game though . It 's very challenging and the reason I like it so much is because I 'm essentially playing against myself . Yeah . That 's the way I look at it . I , I play in , in lo- , a lot of groups and but I , they keep score and , between themselves but I really do n't care . Um , I go out 

and each shot I say , well , this is what I 'm going to try to do -- Uh-huh . -- and then I see how close I can come to that . Right . Yeah , you always work on trying to improve each day and , Yeah , 

and i- , inevitably one facet of my game is n't working at one time or another . Either I 'm not driving very well or I 'm not hitting long irons very well or I 'm not putting well or , but sometimes it all comes together . Yeah . Yeah , I know what you mean . 

I , when I used to golf out there I 'd putt well but I , I would n't , uh , chip well . One of the two , uh , or something would go wrong but I always managed to , to get near par anyway . Well , we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst . Oh . And I went to that . Craig Statler won in a playoff . Uh-huh . But we , uh , this is a big golf area . Yeah . 

We have a lot of , uh , I 'd say we probably have within fifteen miles , twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course , Pine Hurst and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year . Uh-huh . Do you have , uh , long waits , uh , to get on the course ? Yes , we do as a matter of fact . It , it , uh , it 's only been that way in the last five years . Yeah . 

But now you , uh , most of the courses have a , uh , two day advance tee time you have to call , Yeah . Okay . I just moved into this small community so I 'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here . I 'm hoping that wo n't be , cou , I , was from the , uh , twin cities area . That 's some cold golf too , is n't it ? Yeah . Are you sure you guys are n't having the bad weather ? We have cold . Yeah . Usually January and the first two weeks of February . Well , I wish that 's all we had . But , uh , last week we were in the seventies . Something is coming through now so it 's like in the low forties right now . Oh . 

But , uh , it 's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties . We have very windy winters -- Yeah . -- and very cold . But we do n't get any snow anymore . I do n't , I do n't know what changed that pattern . We used to get four or five inches a year . Now we get nothing . It 's been probably five years since we 've had any measurable snowfall . I see . Well , at least it , that does n't , uh , get in the way of golfing so that , No , Yeah . Get out my orange golf ball and go out . Yeah , that 's what they do here sometimes . 

You hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there but , if you got ,
