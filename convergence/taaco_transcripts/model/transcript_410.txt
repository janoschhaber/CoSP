Yes . I have n't , uh , talked to anybody outside the Metroplex , so I did n't even think of saying Arlington , Texas .  This is a real first . Yes . Are you at work ? Yes , 

I am . I , I , I 've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening and I thought , well , I 'm not having any luck , I 'll try the middle of the afternoon . Well , I 'm , I 'm happy we got through . 

I am , too . Well , do you have any , uh , opinion on the subject ? Well , I 'm , I 'm especially interested with what , what 's happening in the Soviet Union , uh , 

the , the move to , uh -- Democracy . -- the , the , the , Ukraine 's vote to , uh , basically to secede and set itself up independently -- Oh . -- uh , is quite a remarkable , counts , is that , is that reported in the Texas papers ? Oh , sure , we , uh , we hear a little of the news . Uh , yeah , I have heard about that the last couple of days . How , how big is the Ukraine , the area , do you know ? Uh , as an area , it 's not , Or a population or anything , I 'm really uninformed . 

I , I 'm afraid I do n't have the statistics in front of me . Uh-huh . It 's a , , it 's not a tiny area . Uh , if I was looking at a U S map , I would say it was sort of reminds me of , of a , uh , it 's not as big as California proportionately . Uh-huh , uh-huh . But , but , but it 's , it 's more significant , in the sense of , it 's a great agricultural region . Oh , I see , 

oh , I , I did n't really know that , I know a lot of their , oh , their countries that they had overtaken , or wanted to be independent or several of them , right , Yeah . And , uh , what about Astonia , are they , They 're completely out now . Right , I thought they were . Yes , the three , the three Baltic , uh , republics got out as quickly as they could . But , but , the , the Ukraine is especially significant because it , of the agriculture ? Right , 

it 's , it 's very important for the economics of the whole , of the Soviet Union . Uh , so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could . Right , uh , except they ca n't fight . No , they do n't , It 's done democratically , uh , And Bush has already given his opinion on it , right ? Yes . 

Did n't I read that ? Yes . So , now , uh , not that they may , that may matter , I do n't know , anymore . I , uh , fear for the Russians from what I read , you know , I wonder how they 're going to get through the winter . Uh , Food wise or any wise , sounds to me like they 'll start rioting soon , or not that that would do any good , but I guess people do that when they 're desperate . That , that 's true , uh , has n't happened here for a while , but it , uh , Well , that 's true , since the Depression , I guess when the veterans went to Washington -- Uh-huh . 

-- and well , you know , the war riots , of course . Let 's just hope we do n't get to that point .  Things are not so good in Texas job wise . No , I 've , I 've heard they 're , I hear you have some problems . Well , we do . 

We have lots and lots of , uh , layoffs here . Lot of companies folding , lot of layoffs and it 's pretty scary . Do , do you , do you blame the , the government in Washington for this ? Well , I do n't understand economics that well . I do n't know , I , I know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we do n't -- Yeah . -- and so I assume that that has some effect . Yeah . Or a great effect . Uh-huh . And I do , uh , I mean , they said during the way , Reagan-Bush years , the rich got richer , the poor got poorer , the statistics prove that so , uh , I , I guess , So then , you think it 's , it 's , you think it 's Reagan and Bush have done this 

or is it just coincidence it was during this period ? Well , I really do n't know . I think maybe they , uh , maybe they contributed to it . Maybe they should pay more attention to these trade , or , you know , to the more equalization of the trade . Uh-huh . Of course , if somebody in , in China can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions , well , I do n't know what 's going to happen then . Oh , the Chinese use slave labor , too . Right . That 's , that 's one of the ways they get away with it . 

And child labor . Yeah . Right . Well , I do n't know . What do you think has caused our horrible situation ? Uh , I do n't think there 's any one -- One thing . -- simple answer to the whole thing . I mean it 's , that 's very complicated . Right , 

well , they say , too , that having a democratic congress and republican President is not good . I mean , I 've read that is a theory . So which one are we going to throw out ? Well , I hate to say it , 

but , I , I 'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party . Uh-huh . Uh , Texas , Texas used to be a democratic state , did n't it ? Oh , I know , it used to , right . Well , you do n't want too many democrats anymore and for a while I kind of deserted the party , but now it 's looking better to me . I like your governor . Oh , do you ? 

Oh , I 'm glad to hear that . She 's an impressive woman . Well , I think so , too . I , I just , admire her a lot . Yeah . 

And , uh , I ho , I really hope she does well . But she 's , uh , n- , you know , probably more popular out of the state than she is here , although she did manage to win . Right . But look who she was running against , you know . Well , yeah , anybody could beat Claytie in Texas . 

He shot himself in the foot so many times .  How did you get on this T I thing ? Oh , I , I know some of the people .
