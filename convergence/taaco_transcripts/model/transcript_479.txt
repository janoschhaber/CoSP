Well , got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone there ? No , I do n't think there is any such thing , as a crime free zone any longer . I 'm afraid you 're right . Uh , one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought , oh , well , something 's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams and the next thing I know there are policemen all around my house . Oh , my . And they had stopped a , uh , b- , a stolen car -- Oh , boy . -- and caught one of the men in the hedge and then the other one was on the roof in the back . By your house ? B- , on my house . Oh , my goodness . Aye , aye , aye . So I 'm very much aware of , uh , crime in the cities and the , and the concern about it . Oh , my . That 's , that 's got to be a frightening way to -- 

It was . -- spend an evening . I , uh , I kept hearing noises and so I , I knew that I was not going to sleep until I got up and went out and checked the garage , so I got a g- , my gun and walked to the , you know , through the house into the garage . There was no one there , but I wanted to be sure . Oh , boy . Is Plano beginning to experience the , the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan , you know , in the -- Unfortunately -- 

-- urban area ? -- yes . That 's -- Yes . -- too bad . I think , uh , you know , as any city grows up , uh , you get the hoods and the roof- , riffraff and -- Uh-huh . -- everybody else -- Uh-huh . -- in there , and I think , uh , you know , fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek , but , uh , we 've been , we 've lived here sixteen years and -- Uh-huh . -- now you , you know , you can tell the change , for sure . Well , I was thinking , if you 've been there that long , you 've seen Plano grow -- Yes . -- from what was really a , a small town to a city . Well , with all the , uh , Central Expressway , uh , with all the stores and the , uh , restaurants and the -- Uh-huh . -- uh , convenience stores and all that kind of stuff , it 's just prime pickings for people driving by . Yeah . You know and , Well , I was appalled to read the other day about the , uh , uh , shooting on the tollway . That 's , that could n't be too far from you , neither . Uh , well , it 's farther west of me . Okay . I live over near White Rock Lake . Oh , yes , okay . But , uh , uh , it was really frightening to , think that , uh , it 's not even safe to drive onto the tollway , or for those people in the tollbooth . Uh , I never thought about someone robbing those , but , apparently , they do . I do n't know , uh , how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody but , Yeah , it just does n't seem possible , does it . It 's kind of , kind of stupid , is n't it . Uh-huh . But I guess when people do those things , they do n't really give a thought of the consequences at the time . It 's , looks like -- No . 

-- easy pickings and away you go , right . Yeah , and I think the drugs play a tremendous part in , uh , the theft and the , the violence that we see . I think you 're right , uh , although I think that may be an excuse for people , too . 

It , it is convenient , is n't it ? Right . I did n't know what I was doing . Right . That kind . Right , 

just like the old alcohol idea and -- Uh-huh . -- I think people , uh , I think when you have haves and have nots , you 're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it 's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up -- Uh-huh . -- than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money . Well , yes , and I work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System . Oh , boy . And , uh , uh , Where do you work ? Uh , do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are ? Uh , yes , I think I do . That , uh , is that Amelia Earhart , -hart School there ? Uh , no this is over near Lincoln High School . Okay . Uh , just , not far off South Central Expressway . That 's a pretty rough area there , is n't it ? It is a pretty rough area . We 're over by Fair Park . Oh , my goodness . And , uh , you know , you watch the people . There are marvelous B M W -s and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns . Huh . And the kids see that and , uh , they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where , uh , you know , running for , uh , drug dealers if , Definitely that area , that , that 's big time . Uh-huh . Big time there , sure is . It surely is . I do n't think I 'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself MUMBLEx . Well , I 'm careful . Gee- , that 's the worst neighborhood in the whole c- , area . Yeah , it 's , uh , a little scary sometimes and , uh , I manage the ,
