Okay , um , do you have any pets now ? Well , we do n't right now , no . We 've , uh , 

I grew up with , uh , with pets . My folks and I always had a dog and a cat , some , Yeah . birds , but , uh , right now we do n't have anything . Oh , okay . Um , that , What about you ? a matter of choice , or compulsion ? 

Well , we 've just , uh , it seems like , we 've always been at a place where we 'd have to go away for the summer or something and , uh , it was , Yeah . never convenient to have anything . MUMBLEx we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house . Yeah . Uh , someplace where there , you know , we can take care of it and everything . We 've got , Yeah . some children who would just really , uh , enjoy having an animal , you know , a dog , I think and , Yeah . What about you all ? Well , right now I 'm a student , and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that . Oh , no . No , we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat . Is that right ? Yeah . They 're very strict about it . But you like , uh , you like pets and things ? Oh , I love animals . Oh , yeah . I was raised , 

our house when I , when I was growing up there was almost never , uh , at least one cat in the house . Uh-huh . It was al- , almost always at least one cat , sometimes , you know , like fifteen or twenty . But , uh , always cats in the house . Oh , yeah . We , we , Oh . enjoyed them . We like , we like pets , but , uh , you know , you 've got to deal with , uh , taking care of them and , and feeding them and everything like that . Yeah . And our kids are , we 've got some children and they 're not , not used to it , you know , on a daily basis . They , they , uh , How old are your kids ? Oh , from fourteen down to seven . Okay . You sound like you 've got some small ones in the background . One . Is that right ? Our first . 

He 's about te- , eleven weeks now . Oh , great . Yeah . Congratulations . Yeah . Where are you from ? Uh , originally ? Uh-huh . West Virginia . Okay . 

Um , I do n't know how familiar you are with that area of the country but , I 've been to Charleston . Charleston , West Virginia ? Yes , uh-huh . Okay , 

that 's pretty much the south end of the state , or the southern quarter of the state , anyway ? . Uh-huh . Okay , in the north end of the state , you 've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania . Uh-huh . Right at the base of that northern peninsula -- Uh-huh . -- is my hometown . Well , that 's , yeah , that 's interesting . So it 's really up north in the country , really , MUMBLEx . Yeah , I guess so . yeah . 

It 's , well , um , my parents ' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it -- Gosh . -- continued that far . I see . So , It 's pretty nice country up there ? Oh , it 's beautiful . Hills , or what ? Uh , well , from my neck of the woods , it 's hilly . Uh-huh . Um , you know , uh , maybe three hundred , four hundred feet elevation , uh , Uh-huh . type variations from the valleys up to the hills , the hilltops . Is it farmland ? Um , not a lot of farmland there . Mostly it 's , uh , I mean , you know , there 's , you know , individuals with their own , own f- , uh , growing their own food . Uh , most of the agriculture , it 's more in the way of , uh , sheep and cattle . Oh , yes . And even that 's , you know , small time mostly . Sure . Uh , the biggest chunk of what 's going on there is , is , uh , industry . Uh-huh . It 's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants . Okay . Uh , aluminum plants . There 's like two aluminum plants MUMBLEx . What are you , what are you studying there at Heidelberg ? Computer engineering . Oh , yeah . What year ? Uh , just finished up my fourth semester . Well , great . Yeah . Yeah . 

I hope that works out well . Yeah , it 's a big change . Yeah . I spent , What 's , twenty years as a mechanic so , Oh , did you ? Yeah .

Oh , okay , good . I 'm working on a bachelor 's degree . It 'll be compu- , 

Hope it 's a good program there . Pardon ? Hope it 's a good program there . Uh , it seems to me , from what I 've been able to find out . Yeah , good . That 's considered a pretty good program . It 's nice and small , which means , you know , if you do n't get the class this semester , then you 've got to wait or three or four s- , you know , anywhere from two to four semesters to get , Huh . it again . But , uh , i- , it 's worth it once you get it . Well , yes , that 's good . And probably a good , uh , student teacher ratio and things . Oh , yeah , yeah . Yeah . Most the class are pretty small . Good . That works out real well . 

Well , I , I was wondering what , if you all were to get a pet , like if you were to move into an apartment or a house somewhere , what would you get ? Uh , well , um , first off we 'd probably wind up with a , a cat or maybe a puppy . Uh-huh . I , I , I 'm partial towards the larger dogs . Uh-huh . Um , our last , we 've , we 've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus . Uh-huh . Uh , had a hamster or two , and they , they got , A hamster . to be a lot of fun . Oh , yeah . Uh , it 's amazing how much character ,
