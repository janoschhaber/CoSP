Okay , what , um , do you watch much T V or , you know . Um , no , I do n't watch much T V . Sometimes , um , usually the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news . 

The news , yeah . But I do n't think of that every day , even . Uh-huh . Um , I think I get most of my current events , well , I get them from everywhere . I sometimes watch T V if I , I guess I watch T V if I have n't read the paper that day . We do n't get a paper but I work , um , at a , I teach a college class and , uh -- Oh , uh-huh . -- there 's a , the library has a paper . And so I often drop in on a break and -- Yeah . -- and read it . And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I 'm home . Uh-huh . And then I , I figure if there 's big , big news , I 'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or , someone else , you know . Yeah , yeah . Now I also , I get it from all over . I watch the news every day , and I ha , we have a news , you know , we get the newspaper , and , uh -- Uh-huh . -- um , magazines , an- , anything . You know , I 'm , I read a lot , so I get , um , you know , I 'm , I 'm really up on , uh , current affairs . I get , you know -- Uh-huh . -- the news and , and everything . Yeah , 

what 's your favorite news , do you get a news magazine or , Um , well , I 'm not getting an- , no , I 'm not getting any news magazines -- Uh-huh . -- but , um , you know , as , as I said , I do , it 's , uh , it 's easy to keep up on current event- , you know -- Yeah . 

-- on cert- , -- Yeah , we 've got . -- you know , especially when you , um -- Uh-huh . -- you know , you get a paper every day . Yeah , yeah , exactly . And , uh . 

Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage ? Uh , I do n't know . Is there anything missing ? I , you know , . Yeah , it 's kind of hard to know . 

And I do n't know , you know , what , what 's , I mean , what are we supposed to , uh , compare it to -- Uh-huh . -- you know , I mean , the quality , uh , whatever they tell you , you know , I , uh , I guess I , I , you know , I 'm satisfied . I mean , I , uh , you know , they , they 're supposedly covering everything that happens , so -- Yeah , yeah . -- you know . 

Well , I do feel like , a little bit like , being from California and wanting to hear like I 've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there 's been an earthquake or sliding or something , and -- Oh , really ? -- I do n't ever hear it in the news here . Oh . 

MUMBLEx Um . Well , uh , sometimes it 's such a , you know , it 's , it 's so , um , slight , you know like -- Yeah . -- the tremors are so slight that they do n't even bother putting it in the -- Yeah . -- paper . But most of the ti- , the times I find that even if there are , you know , they do have like tremors out there , you know , there 'll be a small article in the paper about it . Yeah -- But , uh . -- yeah , yeah . 

I sometimes feel like , um , the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS , um , the top headlines are always a murder , you know . Oh , well . That -- That 's what sells papers . -- that 's because there 's a high crime rate . Yeah . Yeah . That 's , um , that 's been like that since they , the first newspaper , you know . Yeah , yeah , I 'm sure . You know , but , um , I do n't know . I , I guess I 'm satisfied , I do n't , uh . Uh-huh . I mean , what basis , you know , of comparison do we have really ? Yeah , really . We do n't get a , you know . That 's true . We certainly get enough coverage . I mean , we , we can get news , you know , I mean , there 's even the C N N channel -- 

Oh , yeah , I was going to . -- where we can get world news twenty-four hours a day . Sure , yeah . Sometimes you do n't even want to be bothered with the news because it 's all so bad . Yeah . It 's all so negative , you know . Yeah , often times . But . 

So . Yeah . Well , we have to keep talking , I guess . Well , no , 

I guess we can end . Oh . Yeah , it 's just whenever we 're , um . Oh , is it really ? Yeah . Have you always gone until the recording ? Well , yeah , I do n't , I do n't , uh , . Uh-huh . I guess we 're not supposed to . I do n't know , we 're sup- , -- -- I guess we 're supposed to wait or -- Yeah . -- I do n't know . Uh-huh . Becau- , I , you know , like one , uh , well , was it last week , we were supposed to talk about gardening -- Uh-huh . -- uh , and it was really funny , I , I , I mixed it , made the call , 

and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away . Oh , really . Yeah , and it was really . We were laughing , I mean . But , you know , we do n't really do any gardening , so like , that took like a minute -- Uh-huh . -- and then we just talked about , you know , whatever , I mean . Uh-huh . Interesting . Yeah . You know , I mean , some topics , really now , you know , now , this topic , this is , I mean , there really is n't much to say after -- Uh-huh . -- you know , you , uh , you know , you , you tell the person what , uh , news there , uh , you know , where their , where they find their sources of information from -- Yeah . -- and then , you know , if it 's , uh , if they 're satisfied , and that 's about it , really . Uh-huh . It 's hard to talk for five minutes on this . Yeah . So , um . Yeah . Well , I guess I can just say I , it bothers me that I hear a lot about , um , you know , on the news that , well , it seems like , I do n't know , some things are sensationalized or some things are , um , you know , you 'll hear one report and then you 'll hear that it , you know , they did n't , um .
