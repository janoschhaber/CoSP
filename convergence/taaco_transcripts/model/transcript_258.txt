So where was your last vacation ? . Uh , actually my last vacation was in Connecticut . Uh , we went home to visit family . Before that we were in Hawaii . Oh , I , I 'd , well actually I did visit Hawaii once 

but I never made it off of Oahu , Oh . which I 've heard is not the nicest of the islands . It was n't actually . It , w , when we were in Oah- , Oahu , uh , I could n't wait to get off . We , we took a cruise and we went to four different islands and it was a really nice , Kauai was nice and Maui was nice . We had , we had a great time . Uh-huh . We were there for ten days . Oh that 's , wow . Yeah . Yeah , yes . So where have you been ? Oh I 've be , I 've been lots of places . My last vacation was actually in Morocco I guess we , that one would count , Morocco . Really . Uh , that was about a year and a half ago , and , No kidding . An- , what , what , did you just decide to go there or , Uh , well my husband is French and we were living in France at the time -- Uh-huh . -- and we decided that I , I 've never been to Africa and I needed to get that continent since I , had n't been there yet . And it , it 's , actually it 's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go and they speak French and , Uh-huh . so , uh , you know , in that sense is just a little bit easier and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go . And , Yeah . Oh I 'm sure it was wonderful . So we , we did n't really have enough time . We had about , a little bit less than two weeks . Uh-huh . And as always , it don- , it seems a bit , uh , rushed . We do a lot of traveling around . We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere . Was it hot ? No , in fact some of the days we froze . It was , Really ? well we were there in the winter . Uh-huh . In Jan- , uh , January or February , I do n't remember which , Uh-huh . I was born in Saudi Arabia and , uh , Uh-huh . when my father worked there we , they used to travel quite a bit , all around you know , Uh-huh . in , in Europe and whatnot , but I was very young so I do n't remember that and , At wha , at , excuse me , at what age did you , I was three when we moved back here . Oh , that 's too bad because , So I do n't remember 

but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been , Uh-huh . and that I was when I was a baby but so , Morocco I think would be wonderful because that 's , you know , that 's , that area of the world I think would be great . Yeah . It was a very interesting vacation . The only thing I did n't like was in some of the more touristy areas -- Uh-huh . -- uh , um , the , it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide and you , there were some places , Yeah . where people , defini- , there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off , Uh-huh . and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in , you know , in jacket underneath a coat type of thing . Really . But , 

We , we found that in Jamaica . It was the same way , Uh-huh . that people would come up and try and sell you , well try and sell drugs and things like that but they , they were so destitute and I guess they , they make all their money on tourism and , and they would come up and ask you , you know , if , if you want to buy different things and really , after awhile it really gets annoying , Yeah . you know , it , it 's a little scary too when they 're coming up and they 're all over you . 

The , the worst place was in Marrakech -- Uh-huh . -- and the other cities it was n't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was , what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide -- Uh-huh . -- it does n't matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you . Oh really . And it 's worth it and it 's like ten dollars a day or something and it 's worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you -- Really . -- and you feel stupid doing that but we did it , Uh-huh . and we were much happier , Uh-huh . and you also get in to see things that you might not get into -- Uh-huh . -- if you were alone , uh , Well that 's great . Where else have you been ? Uh , Well you lived in France , Yes . so you 've been all through Europe . No 

actually I have n't been all through Europe , No . like I have n't been to Italy yet . Really . Uh , we 're going to go for a conference in September and so , hopefully , we 'll get to travel a little bit too . Uh-huh . Uh , my more exciting spots have been , I 've been to the Galapagos Islands . Really ? Uh-huh , that was one of the most wonderful vacations I 've ever had . 

Lots of wildlife huh ? Yeah . Yes . If you like wildlife , it 's a fabulous vacation . Uh-huh . If you do n't like wildlife it 's probably not of interest . But it , that was really , really fabulous and just the photos I have of it and gosh , incredible and be so close , Now when was that , when were you there ? 

Um , August , eighty-eight . Uh-huh . And then , actually , after there I went to um , Hawaii , a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings -- Uh-huh . -- and so , I went to Hawaii and then to Australia -- Uh-huh . -- and Japan and China , Did you go on the Barrier Re- , did you see the Great Barrier Reef and , and go snorkeling ? I , I , actually I did n't go diving . Uh-huh . 

I , I 'm a diver and so , Oh diving . that 's , that 's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , no I did n't get to the Great Barrier Reef . I drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Au- , Adelaide . Uh-huh . It 's gorgeous , absolutely gorgeous . The coastline was just incredible . It 's huge . Is it really ? Australia . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Uh , but , Did you have shrimp ? 

I 've seen in , you know , they , they show all this wonderful seafood and , and great big prawns , you know the big shrimp and , I do n't remember if I had shrimp . No ? 

Did n't have shrimp there huh ? I do n't think so . I remember food . Oh , I like that too . But , uh , in fact I did n't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car , 

it would have been , I think , much more fun to do it like in the van , Uh-huh . with a bunch of people . Uh-huh . But , uh , Oh you 're adventurous . You went by yourself . Uh-huh . Really . And I was by myself in China too . Really ? Yeah . Oh wow . China was a little bit more , uh , of a challenge . But , it , it was n't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time , Uh-huh . and so I never , you know , got out by myself , or not much , Uh-huh . Was it very expensive ? No , actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit , no maybe it was about a thousand dollars , maybe a little bit less , I do n't really remember , for ten days including all my meals , a guide , a car , the airfare and , You 're kidding ! No kidding ! MUMBLEx but this is from Hong Kong , Uh-huh . because I was already in Hong Kong and , um , but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and I went to Beijing , Shanghai , Chengdu and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little , Quingdao I think is the name of it . It 's a little , uh , sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai . It 's just a train ride . Uh-huh . And that , I had two internal , one , yeah , two internal plane flights and a couple of other things . It was really , 

All for a thousand dollars ? Uh-huh . Wow ! That really surprises me . Around a thousand . I guess I relate it to , to Japan where things are very expensive , are n't they ? Oh , Japa- , Japan 's ridiculous . Yeah . Yeah . And I stayed , I did n't stay in the top of the line hotels but I stayed in , they were all completely clean , Uh-huh . and , you know , they were newly built and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line , hotels , Uh-huh . because they said you ca n't stay in the cheap stuff . Yeah , yeah , and you do n't want to stay in the very , very , very exclusive , Right . because you do n't really even get a flavor of the country if you 're , Right . Yeah , yeah . Wow . Uh , but yeah , that was , tha- , I highly recommend that way to go . 

If you 're ever interested in going the route , I dealt with this woman , her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston . Oh really . Yeah . Uh , and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China and she just gave me this woman 's name to contact and it would really be fun , I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver -- Uh-huh . -- and a guide and then ,
