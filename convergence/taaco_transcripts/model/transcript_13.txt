Okay , uh , my favorite show is MASTERPIECE THEATRE and it has been for a long time but I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it . Do you by any chance ? Oh , yes . You do ! Yes , very much . Well , would n't you know . 

As a matter of fact , I prefer public television . Uh-huh . And , uh , I have , particularly enjoy the English comedies , Yeah , and the English mysteries . Yeah , I watch mysteries too . Is that what you 're referring to ? Yes . Okay , yeah . That is good . I like , uh , do you read ? Vociferously . Okay , well that 's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they 're kind of based on books . Yes . And , the plots are more , um , challenging , you know , than the sitcoms of regular T V . 

Well , unfortunately for us at least here in the United States , we , the only access we have to that of course is public television . Yeah . I 'm , I 'm not a great television watcher in any respect but , uh , the watching , what I do watch is , uh , usually news and whatever is on public television . Any kind of , I also uh , am very fond of great performances , Uh-huh , yeah . in that regard . Me too . But , uh 

Did you stay up late and catch this RED DWARF ? No , Oh , that was a scream . no , no as a matter of fact , uh , Turner Broadcasting , Uh-huh , has been uh , broadcasting all of the James Bond movies , Really . every night this week , so I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies , this week . I used to like him too , he was my hero . In fact , I like Sean Connery to this day . Well , they 're showing uh , LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment , Yeah . and , it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven . Yeah . So , Oh , he can never cut it . No , no that 's true . I was just thinking that today , he did , well , in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate , Yeah , in his early movies . Yeah , yeah , he does . Whereas , uh , Sean Connery has maintained the , uh , how would you , uh , ruddy look , Uh-huh , yeah . I liked his accent too . And , he can even be in movies that are not , uh , uh , sexually oriented , and he still comes off great . Well , you know he was , when was it , last year or year before last , he was voted the sexiest actor in movies , He is . or something . Yeah , he had my vote double . I mean the man is sixty-two years old . I do n't care . But , uh , but otherwise you know we , uh , with P B S and so forth . And I , Yeah . I particularly enjoy , I do n't know whether you 've had a chance to watch it on P B S but uh , the series , uh , YES MINISTER ? Oh , what 's that about ? That was about a , the Interior Minister , it was a comedy , Oh , yeah , yeah . the Interior Minister of , in England , Uh-huh . with the permanent secretary , Right . and bureaucracy and all that . Right , I , I 've seen it several times . It 's a scream , but I have to go to bed , 

I have to get up and , and work the next morning . I wish they 'd put those , that 's why I say , did you stay up late to watch this RED DWARF . It came on after DOCTOR WHO , Uh-huh . on Saturday nights , here at least . And it should , of course I li- really it was , I do n't think they should show it during prime time , but still , Yeah . it was funny . Yeah , I know . 

Well I , I , I 'm not much of a television watcher . I , I read as I said , Uh-huh . and , uh , quite a bit . I read about two or three novels a week , Yeah . in addition to all the technical stuff . What , what do you do ? What kind of work do you do ? I 'm a Payroll Clerk . Just an accounting clerk . 

At T I ? No , uh , I have a friend who works for T I and I work for a tire service , Oh , I see . here in , I 'm from Dallas . Uh-huh . 

Well the last two people who have called , both worked for T I and I just wondered . Yeah , yeah , it could be T I -ers , I think , probably are participating more than anybody else , but I needed the money . This is five bucks here . 

I think that 's something we all ca , Yeah , really . Do you work for T I ? No , no , I work for G T E . Really ? In Maryland , yes . How did you hear , oh we 're not even supposed to be talking about this though , are we ? I guess not . How did I hear about it ? Well I work , you know , they are gathering a data base for voice processing . Uh-huh . And , that 's my field of work also . Oh ! So I , I know the people at T I who are doing this and I heard about it , so I called them and asked if I could participate . And , uh , Oh . You know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth . Right . We could go back to television shows . Well , you know , speaking of public TV , have you caught any of this series on the Bible ? Yes , I have . I 've heard that it 's really against the , well I mean that it 's coming out with the idea that the Bible 's not true . Well , no . That 's , uh , you could interpret it that way . Uh-huh . Uh , I , I think what they are trying to say , is that there is a great deal of historical truth , 

but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh , after the what , uh , was is it the King James Version when the committee did it , wrote the translation , that so much was lost in the translation , particularly since most of the translations were in Greek . Yeah . Well , for example . In Greek there are seven different words for love . Right . Okay , so you can have , there 's one word for love of your brother , one word for love of your wife , one word for , you know , uh , love of your father , and that sort of thing . So , in , as to those types of interpretations , uh , really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now , and what it 's at . Uh-huh . So that 's , you know , you can look at it as though they are saying it 's not true , but there 's too much historical fact involved just from the uh , the histories that are , were developed around that time , that are available . Yeah . To deny that , at least the majority of it is true . So , you know , it depends on how you look at it . Yeah . You can look at it , you know , if you want to say that it 's proven that it is n't true , then you can very much look at it that way . I guess if you 're looking for that , you 're , Yeah , well , that , uh , Well , you can interpret that the , what the T V show , in the same way that you can interpret the Bible . Uh-huh . So , Really . But , uh , as , as far as that goes , I , we at least agree on what we enjoy . Yeah , that 's right . But , uh , I do n't know if there is , there is a time limit on this , Yeah . so , uh . Surely we 've made it . I think so too . Let 's just , it 's been very pleasant talking to you , It was very nice talking to you . and have a good evening . You too . Good night ! Bye-bye .
