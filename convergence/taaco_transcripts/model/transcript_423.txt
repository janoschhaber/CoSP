Well , do you do any recycling ? Uh , we do here . Uh , see , what do we recycle ? We , they recycle , they have bins -- Yeah . -- and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and , uh , plastic bottles and I think that 's all they have . Oh . What about you guys ? 

Well , we , uh , there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here , although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is , uh , aluminum cans . Uh-huh . But , uh , we 've got a , we 've got a couple of different things , uh , places , uh , they 're like unattended aluminum can smashers . And you can go up there and , and , uh , redeem , we 've got one that gives you like a penny a can , so if you , Really ? Yeah . For smashed cans ? Well , actually , you have to give , put them in there unsmashed . Uh-huh . 

And , uh , when you do that it , it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot . Oh , can you , can you hold on for just a minute ? Sure . I 'm going to try pressing one again to make sure -- Okay . -- that I pressed it hard enough because , okay , just succeed . Okay ? Oh , okay , well , I guess , I guess , 

Well , I heard it that , I heard it that time . Yeah . Okay , well , anyways , you guys only get a penny a can . Well , when you buy like , uh , canned drinks and stuff like that , do they charge you for the deposit ? Uh , no , you probably get charged like a nickel -- Yeah . -- or something like that . Exactly and so it 's like they charge you for the deposit , so when you turn in the cans unsmashed , you 're just , like , reimbursed . Oh , okay . 

Type of thing . Okay , no , they do n't charge us that extra nickel . That 's sort of nice , though . Yeah , 

it , it really is . Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the , off the price , if you want to think of it that way . Uh-huh . So when we get like , uh , uh , a twelve pack , then that 's like twelve cents back . Yeah , 

so you guys can actually get ahead . Yeah . But , uh , they have sort of like , uh , things that you c- , you 're not like reimbursed for or paid for . Like we can recycle , uh , clear glass , brown glass , green glass . Yeah . Uh , and milk jugs and , uh , newspapers , you know , everyone does newspapers . Yeah , yeah , everybody does newspapers . But , that , that kind of stuff . Yeah . But they , they said they ca n't be smashed or else , uh , it does n't fit in their little containers 

and they 're not reimbursed by the , the people who are over them or something . Well , shoot , maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed , uh , Pepsi cans and whatever -- Yeah . -- up there . Exactly , yeah , 

send it to this address , no . But , uh , let 's see , they said that , how , ways , can encourage recycling , uh , I , I , I tell you what , what really works , uh , at least down here is , if there is , if there is some , e- , even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it , you know what I mean , then people tend to do it . Uh , Yeah , 

that 's , In other words , taking care of the environment is , is all well and good -- Uh-huh . -- but if it 's going to cost you to take care of the environment , they 're not quite as , uh -- As likely to do it . -- likely to do it -- Yeah . -- as if , uh , if you get something back for it . You know . Yeah , that 's true . And , uh , so , you know , if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings , anything that they can pass on to the consumer , you know , it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card , you know , to get money -- Uh-huh . -- or doing your banking . Yeah . You know , if it 's free , people will use it , if it costs them something , then they 're not as likely to use it . Yeah , exactly . You know . But , uh , I know we had a problem down here with , uh , oil , people taking oil out of their cars -- Uh-huh . -- and just putting it down the d- , you know , the s- , the drain sewer . Yeah . And , uh , all that , because there was , apparently a lot of people , you know , every time they change the oil , they just dump all the res- , their old oil down there . Uh-huh . Now they 're starting to recycle that stuff . Oh , that 's good . 

Uh , another thing I thought of , I guess , to recycle would be like clothes , because I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other . And one way that we do it sort of in , in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops . Yeah . And that way , you know , you do n't get near enough as , as much as you bought it for , but you , you got the use out of it and what you 're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever , anyways , you can get a little bit of money for . Yeah . And so -- Yeah . -- that 's something that I 've never , I , we 're , we 're new to Iowa so that 's something that I had n't , you know , looked into before . But that 's one way to sort of get money and still recycle , I guess . Yeah , I know a lot of places , they , uh , uh ,
