All right so , uh , you live in Dallas ? Yes , I live in Dallas . Now I understand that , um , the , the real estate market out there has really gone crazy , up and down , up and down . Yeah , I think right now it 's , it 's kind of bad . Uh , I do n't live in a house , I live in an apartment . Oh . Are , are you in a house ? Yeah , uh-huh . Okay . Yeah , we have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington . Uh-huh . 

Well , I guess the best I can do is , is , uh , compare apartments .  If it can compare the one that I have now ,  with the one that I had the last time , the one that I have now , uh , has a lot more amenities , I guess is the right word , than the one that I moved out of . Uh , this one , you know , gave us free cable and , uh , ceiling fans and , uh , it was practically new when I moved in here and the carpet was new and , Huh . Do you live in the high-rise ? No , it 's not a high-rise . It 's just a , a two story building . Uh-huh . Uh , but there 's , you know , there , there are a lot of buildings but it 's just two stories . Uh , on the second floor they have , they do n't have a patio but they have a sunroom instead of the patio . On the first floor , um , where I am , there 's a patio . Oh , okay . So , so you just , you have one floor all to yourself ? Yeah . Oh , okay . The rooms are nice and large and , let 's see , I have , I have two bedrooms . And , uh , MUMBLEx , Oh , that 's nice . Do you get your own washer , dryer ? Well , I , I , I have a washer and dryer area and I , I did buy the washer and dryer , but they did n't provide it . Oh . The one that I moved from did n't , did n't have a place to put them , and that 's one of the reasons that I did move . Yeah . That is nice . Yeah .  Get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat . Yeah . So , tell me ab- , Yeah , I 've always , uh , been pretty lucky . The real estate out here 's been pretty good . 

It , uh , the , the prices of , well , the prices came down last year . We 've , we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome . Yeah . The past , uh , uh , year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia . Uh-huh . It just , 

It just never happened before . It 's a real good , So it 's really surprising everybody . 

All the developers do n't know what to do . Yeah , it 's a good time to buy , Yeah , if you 're in the market . unfortunate- , we 're , uh , we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids -- Uh-huh . -- and we have a three bedroom house . And it 's pretty much filled up right now . Oh , so you want a bigger one . Yeah , uh-huh . Get an extra bedroom or a basement . Right now it 's just a , a single level rambler . Uh-huh . One thing about the houses in , uh , in Dallas , they do n't , uh , utilize basements the way they did in New York .  My parents in New York had , uh , a , uh , three family house . Uh-huh . Actual MUMBLEx a ,  two family house where the , the , um , the downstairs and the second floor they had , and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment , you know . Oh . And , uh , they had a basement ,  and they , you know , they finished the basement , and they were able to rent that out also . But , uh , in Dallas I , I just , I just have n't seen basements in houses . Yeah , yeah . And I 've looked at a lot of them , you know . Yeah , a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there , and that 's what he said was that , you know , it just was n't something that people had down there . No , it 's a- , They put pools and garages on , Right . but , uh , no basements . I have n't , I have n't , I have yet to see a basement in a house . Huh . And , uh , Maybe it 's all the sand . Is there a lot of sand in , I always think it 's like a desert , I do n't know . MUMBLEx Dallas always , Well , no . No , no , no , you know , I do n't see that kind of sand here . Um , there are some areas though where , where they have a problem with , uh , the houses kind of sinking a little bit -- Uh-huh . -- into the , to the , uh , or the foundation is sinking or something . You know , just a little , just a little bit , some more than others . But you , you have to know the right spot ,  to , to pick where that does n't happen . Yeah . And , uh , Well , out here we , um , we live in what used to be , uh , like a prairie or whatever a natural , you know , natural grasslands . Uh-huh . And , uh , they , it 's just , you go down four inches and you get to sands- , well , fourteen inches you get to sandstone . Yeah . And so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast . I see . It 's just solid sandstone . Huh . Where did you say you 're at , Colorado ? No , Virginia . Virginia , Virginia . That 's right . Yeah , it 's sort of unusual really . Most of Virginia is clay . Anywhere near , uh , Virginia Beach ? Oh , yeah , uh-huh . Yeah . My , uh , my folks used to live there . Back before I was born , Oh . 

they lived there . Uh-huh . Well , different areas in Dallas have different kind , in , uh , in Texas I 'll say because down in east Texas there 's a lot of red clay . Uh-huh . And , uh , in the , in the Dallas , you know , Fort Worth city areas you do n't see that . Yeah , well , uh , Texas is a big state so I imagine the , the type of houses and , uh , things like that are truly different from area to area . Yeah , well , But , uh , that 's the same way out here because , um , well , we , for example , and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington -- Uh-huh . -- and anything instead that beltway , the highway , the real estate 's forty thousand dollars more expensive . Yeah . 

So , you know , you really ca n't afford , I , I , I could never afford a house inside the beltway . That 's why we came out here . This is called the , the , the country , you know , with only , you know , maybe twenty miles total from D C , twenty-five -- Huh . -- from the city . But , um , it 's considered the country since it 's , uh , you know , that far out . Well MUMBLEx , But , um , yeah , we live out by Dulles Airport . I see . Yeah , and , uh , that 's one of the few places still in northern Virginia they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here and , you know , it 's , it 's still pretty rural . Uh-huh . Uh , not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore . Land has gotten so expensive they just ca n't afford to have low income housing like that . So , is your house in an area by itself ? I mean , No , we 're in a development . it 's not connected to another one ? 

There 's , uh , yeah , there 's another one half an acre away , Oh . or a quarter acre away rather . But it 's not , they 're not connected are they ? Oh , no . Huh-uh . You have to , uh , stay in one single family home . I sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up . Yeah . 

Uh , my folks , um , had an apartment for a while when we were kids but , um , for the most part i- , they , they always had , you know , and Pennsylvania always had a single family home and so , Uh-huh . you know , as soon as we could we , we got a single family home , and that 's all I ever knew growing up , Uh-huh . so . I stayed in a townhouse for , uh , two years and then , uh , saved up enough money to , to get a ,
