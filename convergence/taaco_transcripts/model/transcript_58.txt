Yeah , the question was , uh , what kind of books do you read for entertainment , uh , uh , I guess , Oh , I just read for escape . Okay . 

Well , I mean it 's , With two little kids I can understand that . Yes . It 's that 's simple . 

I read to escape , and I do n't read any PARENTS magazines either . Oh . So . What , uh , what kind of , Well , I just finished , just , I just finished one last night . A great book . It , it 's very , a typical for my reading though but a great book , one called , THE THINGS THEY CARRIED by Tim O'Brien . Huh . And it 's , uh , God I do n't know if I would call it a collection of Vietnam war stories or if I 'd call it a collection of Vietnam love stories . Oh . 

Strange book . Beautifully written . Uh-huh . Just beautifully written . By , uh , somebody who was there or , Yeah , a guy who was there as a , uh , foot soldier . Uh-huh . So , he considered himself to be , you know , a , a true Vietnam soldier . Yeah . Well , any of the guys that were ground MUMBLEx yes . Yeah , I can imagine . Yeah . So , what 's the latest one you 've read ? Well , I tell you what , 

I 'm a kind of , uh , a history nut . I 'm trying to think back now , I read an awful lot of , uh , periodicals and , uh , you know , almost what you call reference books . Uh-huh . And , uh , the last , uh , I 'm embarrassed to say the last , you know , honest to gosh , cover to cover book that I read , I can not , right offhand , I tried to read , uh , one of the , the Michener , uh , LONE STAR or the , the TEXAS HISTORY BOOK . 

I have never been able to make it through any of Michener 's work . Oh , well , I 've had similar problems . It does tend to , to , Have you , are you a Civil War buff at all ? Yeah , as a matter of fact , yeah . Because I finished one , 

I think this is like two years ago , and somebody had given me one of these dinky do , crappy women 's novels set in the Civil War , John Jakes with , Yeah . and the novel did n't do that much for me . But , boy , the period of time was fascinating . Uh-huh . So , I then read , was it BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM , Uh-huh . or , yeah , I think it was BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM . BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM . It 's kind of like a historical compendium , Yeah . of the Civil War , and it 's not a story of the Civil War , it 's a story of all the politics and , uh , lobbying and just basically state by state events , Uh-huh . that lead to the events that brought about the Civil War . And it 's fascinating because I had always , you know , been raised on this , you know , Emancipation Proclamation with the Civil War . Uh-huh . There was a lot more to it than that , were n't there ? There was a lot more to it than that . As a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought . Yeah , well , it was a political move . Oh , yeah . 

It was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because , you know , it was , uh , if you read it , it only emancipated those who were in areas , uh , in rebellion against the United States . All the other areas which would , I think at that time would have included West Virginia and , oh , may have been Kentucky , a few states , you know , that were not part of the South but still had slaves . Uh-huh . They did n't emancipate them . 

Well , you know what else really surprised me , now I 'm married to a native Texan and I 'm not . Uh-huh . Uh , 

I 've got the same problem . yeah , I 'm glad you put it that way . And I have two native Texan children too . Yeah . My husband is always , you know , talked about th- , Texas being a , uh , rebel state . Uh-huh . And , oh , my God , all this Civil War pride . I kept waiting for , where 's some reference to this goddamn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War . Mayb- , is n't much there , was there ? They might as well have not even been there . Right . You know , they were n't a state and the only , the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to , you know , who 's going to be going there . And I keep telling my husband that , and he keeps saying , oh , no . 

I thought , okay . They supplied some , uh , you know , they were some groups of it , the Vicksburg , if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg , the battleground at Vicksburg , uh , there 's an area there where there was , uh , some Texas , uh , groups and they had an interesting time there . 

Oh , I 'll bet they did . And down there at Sabine Pass , uh , I ca n't think of the guy 's name but he held off , uh , you know , just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story . Well , you know , why they actually held them off ? None of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar . That could be it , could be it . Now , you did n't hear me say that . Outside of , uh , And then the last Civil War battle was fought at Val Verde , you know , over there on the Texas border you had a lot of , of groups heading for Mexico and they were cut off at the pass more or less , at Eagle Pass . And they did n't get across the river there so they 're , the last , and that was actually after the war was over 

but it was the last , Yeah . organized battle between the two units was in Texas , so . Oh . Yeah , Texas participation in the Civil War was , uh , minor at , uh , it 's been , Boy , 

do n't tell that to a native Texan though , Yeah . I mean , my god , they fought and won the whole thing . Yeah , well , my wife 's from Galveston , so . Oh . Yeah . Well , I 'm from New Mexico so , you know , I was , 

That 's a beautiful state . That 's a beautiful state . See I was raised in the Midwest which , Uh-huh . you know , hell , we did n't even , you know , we did n't even know where the Mason Dixon Line was , and besides , you know , if corn did n't grow there , Huh . it did n't matter . 

It sounds like Iowa or something . Iowa and Nebraska . Uh-huh . Yep . And then I had probably lived the last eleven years in Massachusetts so , you know . Uh-huh . What does that make me , an honorary Yankee or , Yeah , on , yeah . God knows what . 

Oh , well , my sister 's living in Illinois right now , so . Well then , she 's going to come out well rounded . Yeah . But outside of those kind of things , you know , the other thing that I 've really gotten into reading , and I think this is because the kids are getting to me , Uh-huh . is science fiction . I 've always kind of enjoyed it . I , I used to read a lot more than I do now . Well , I 've gone to the point where my husband , my husband travels , I get out like , you know , two or three books . Uh-huh . And I , I 'm trying to think of , oh , Isaac Asimov , ROBOT series . Yeah . I mean , I think I 've read all four of them 

and I understand that there 's a fifth . Uh-huh . In the last six weeks he 's been on the road a lot . I just turned around and looked at my brief , at my briefcase , my , uh , bookcase up here and I see ARMAGEDDON up there . 

And , uh , the SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE and TWO THOUSAND AND TEN and GRANT TAKES COMMAND and THE WAR IN THE YEAR , oh , SPACE MUMBLEx that was the one I was trying to wade through was SPACE , James Michener . Did n't get very far on that . You know , I think I read HAWAII , Yeah . when I was about ten years old or so . Yeah . Which is about the developmental level that , you know , you need to be at to read those things , and I still even then I was so , so disgusted with it I , I tried to read , I do n't remember which other one it was , whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller . Yeah . And I just , I got about like a hundred pages through it and realized I had like a thousand more , I thought , I ca n't do this . Yeah , it really the , the books are kind of , uh , imposing to say the least . Yeah . No , let 's see , here 's one called GHOST TOWNS AND MINING CAMPS OF NEW MEXICO now , not too many people have read that one I do n't think . No . And there 's THE HISTORY OF YOAKUM COUNTY , TEXAS there . I 've got , uh , Is that a big , thick book ? Yeah , and I 've got , yeah , and I 've got a HISTORY OF KINGSLEY , IOWA . What the , what the hell for ? Why Kingsley , Iowa ? Well , because that 's where my folks all came from . Oh , okay . And they had a centennial here awhile back . I read the GRANT TAKES COMMAND , that was pretty good . Well , 

That was part of that trilogy that , uh , Now that 's one that , Bruce Canton did . That 's one I do n't know . See , I had never really been into science fiction that much until , uh , somebody gave me MIST OF AVALON probably about five or six years ago . Yeah . I do n't know if I 'd call it science fiction or fantasy . Sometimes it 's awful hard , some of those get very philosophical they can be in any setting , they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting , you know , the , 

Well , I loved that novel . And then somebody said , oh , God , this would have been even long ago because I was in Boston and it was raining all night , and I had a hole in my roof and I was waiting for the whole house to collapse , and , uh , I was reading DUNE . Oh . Which seeming rather ironic . Yeah . And I read the whole damn book while I was home hauling out , you know , like ten-gallon buckets of , of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and , Uh-huh , you 're reading DUNE . reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits and , I think that 's probably my favorite of , of any piece of science fiction that I 've ever read . That was a movie too , was n't it ? And the movie was awful . Was it ? Oh , yes , it was just terrible . Yeah , I 'd , I did n't see it but , uh , yeah . It was , it was beyond , uh , 

Patrick Stewart was in that . I guess the guy that 's on the new STAR TREK series was in that thing , uh . I do n't know , I just remember Sting was in it . 

Oh , really ? . Yeah , and if you were trying to follow any type of , uh , plot , it , it total- , even having read the book , and I 've read that book probably three times , Uh-huh . watching that movie , I could n't figure out , Could n't , what they were talking about , at all . Yeah . I was real disappointed in that . Well , I 'll tell you another good book , do you like scary things ? Um , well , some history , Have you , 

books are pretty scary , but , yeah . That 's true . Have you read , THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS ? No . Somebody who , Oh . saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they 'd ever seen , they did n't sleep all night . Well , see I , I am debating whether or not I want to go see the movie after having read the book . Yeah . I mean the book is , is chilling . Yeah , I have , Just chilling . no , uh , I do n't have the foggiest notion what it 's about , so . Then I wo n't tell you . Okay , yeah . But , It 's just that if you 're ever , ever really want to just be scared out of your wits , Uh-huh , that 's the one . That 's the one . Yes . Even better than JAWS and some of that ? Yes , because the cat- , the , the character that is so horrible is another human being . And you 're just drawn into his , his horror , 

of him that you , Yeah . begin to kind of like him . Oh . I mean , A , a Freddy Kruger type , huh ? No , no . This guy 's smart and he 's suave and he 's all the charac- , all the , 

Oh the worst kind , yeah , characteristics , yeah . yeah , all the characteristics ...
