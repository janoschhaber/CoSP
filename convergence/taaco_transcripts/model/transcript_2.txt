This is Archie . Hi , Archie . I 'm Sharon . Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES ? Yeah . I 've seen that , that 's , uh , that was a really good movie . 

Probably one of the best things about it was the scenery and , uh , I thought the story was pretty good , too . I , I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it . Have you ever lived in that part of the country ? No . 

I have n't . Have you ever visited it ? Um , I 've visited the Wyoming area . 

I 'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed . I think it was the black hills of South Dakota . Could be . I , n- , I have n't been to South Dakota . Have , have you been up to that ? 

Well , I lived in Omaha for five , Oh . winters , Okay . and that rolling kind of , uh , Terrain . Yeah . Is , is fairly famili , . The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics , apparently it 's going to win everything . Really ? Uh , and I had been told , you know , you would n't notice that it was three hours long , and all this , That 's true . kind of , I agree with that . Um , I , I noticed yesterday in the paper , something said that it , 

I think it 's been nominated for twelve awards and , and all the critics initially said that , you know , it would n't go anywhere , that it was just going to be a dud . So , it , it has surprised everybody . Well , the interesting thing was is I had heard that , and I , I , I tend to , I think , overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it 's that great . And , and -- Uh-huh . -- it was , the thing is , it was , it was a good story . Right . And , and , and I guess that 's what I really like . Although , I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour . Did you ? Yeah . Have you seen SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY ? No . 

I 've heard , I 've heard that 's really great , though . Y- , you have to go see that one . And how about SILENCE OF THE LAMB ? No , Go . You must really keep up . 

I do . I go every weekend . I , I , uh , those are two definite must see movies , I think . Well , is n't , is n't SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY , is n't that a , i , is it , is it a terror movie or is it just suspenseful ? It 's suspenseful . I do n't think it 's very t- , 

I mean , there 's not really any , uh , blood and guts in it or anything like that . It 's , it 's more suspense . Um , the other one , SILENCE OF THE LAMBS , is kind of a , a gory movie , if , if somebody 's not into that kind of stuff . It 's , it 's pretty graphic at points . But , uh , I think they 're both excellent movies . Do you , do you listen to Gary Cogill ? 

No . Huh-uh . Is , uh , do you know who he is ? Yeah . Somebody in South Carolina told me about him . He 's a , the movie critic . 

Um , oh , you 've , oh , okay . He 's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas . Yeah . And he does , uh , he has a talk show on the , K L I F . Anyway , it 's on from seven to nine , or something . And , and , and people call in and it 's , if you keep up with movies , it 's kind of interesting . There 's a certain a mount of dribble that they do . They 've got , uh , they 've got a couple of kids , ten or twelve years old , and they call in and they review movies . But it 's , uh -- Oh . -- he , anyway , he , it 's interesting . You listen to him and then you , you go watch the movie . In fact , they had , people had just seen , I was listening Sunday night a little bit when , Uh-huh . I was going to pick up my daughter . But , anyway , it was , uh , the , it , it 's interesting , though , or did he just do it ? 

I think that , I think he really , his heart was in it , but I , I do n't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was . I think it was something that he really wanted to do . He wanted to direct it , he wanted to , to star in it . You know , he , he enjoyed the story line and I think he just really w , he really wanted it . And whether it , whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office , I think he would have been happy . Because I think that , I think he did a good job and , and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him . Do you know who the guy was that was playing the , uh , the , the wagon driver ? Um . 

A little piece of trivia . You know , the guy when he first headed out from the army post . Yeah . Who , no I do n't know who that guy is . He , he plays on MURPHY BROWN . Oh , he does ? Yes . 

He 's , -- As a recurring character every week ? -- he 's Eldon , her housepainter . Oh . Can you , No , believe that ? 

now see , I 'd , I 'd a never put those two together . That 's , that 's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said , did you notice that ? Huh-uh . I thought , no , it 's really funny . But I thought , it , it , you think back , and yeah , it was him , but with a -- Yeah . -- you know , with the beard and all that stuff . I mean , it 's , uh , Yeah , real scruffy looking . Yeah . Real scruffy looking , and it wa , it was really funny , it 's , uh , that , that he winds up playing in the movie . But I thought , it 's good that , you know , it was a lot of fun . Yeah . I do n't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we 're at about five minutes . I should think we 've done enough . You think so ? I mean , I have n't been watching my watch . Um , I guess , yeah . Does it usually cut off ? Is that what , Well , I do n't know . it does ? 

Why do we end this thing ? It used to , I think it just says hang up . it used to just automatically cut off 

but it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up . So , Why do n't we do that ? I , I guess so . Okay . 

Good-bye Sharon . Good talking to you Archie .
