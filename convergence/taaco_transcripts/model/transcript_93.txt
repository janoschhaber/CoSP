So , do you have any hobbies ? Well , right at the present time nothing real special . I kind of like gardening and I 'm kind of into camping and , you know , vacationing , that sort of thing . Yeah , uh , 

I do n't have any real serious , I 'm an avid gardener , oh , Oh , okay . I think you 're , Um , I consider that a hobby . I do n't know , they were like suggesting , like handcraft things which , Uh-huh . I guess that 's a really true , true hobby , 

but I , Yeah . I think anything that you enjoy , Yeah . um , it does n't really have to matter , I mean , it could be working on cars could be your hobby really . Really yeah , 

I kind of enjoy doing that a little bit , too . No , I , I guess if you make money at it , it becomes a vocation . well , I do n't know , I told my husband , I said , you go out some to work on the car , it 's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong . 

I says , you go pay to have someone do it . Yeah . Because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something . I guess as far north as you are if you like gardening , you 've still got a couple months to go , have n't you ? 

Oh , yeah . Um , well , right now we , um , start our seeds inside . Uh-huh . Oh , yeah , that 's right , you would , yeah . We 'll start them inside and , uh , In cold frames or whatever the , Yeah , well , we usually start them right in the house . Uh-huh . My sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck and , and the wi- , and a wind storm come and knock it down . Huh . But she 's had really good luck . I mean , i- , ca- , next month , well , actually , it , if you , if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside , pretty much the end of May , you can leave them outside . Uh-huh . You might put them in the ground just the first week of June -- Yeah . -- but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of May . Yeah , I 've , I 've lived in , in Texas and New Mexico most of my life , but I did once , I spent one winter in North Dakota , Oh . and I , I remember that it was on into May before it really started warming up , and , uh , Yeah , well , well , we live , we live really close to Lake Champlain , which is in the Champlain Valley , Oh , yeah . so we 're a little , we 're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts so , Okay , because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit ? Yeah . Yeah . 

We are a little lucky . Well , You 're at , my brother lives ten miles from here and he gets frost and , Yeah . his crop gets killed . You 're right across the , uh , lake from , what , Plattsburgh ? Yeah , from Plattsburgh Air Force Base . Yeah , yeah . But , um , Yeah , I had , I had a cousin that was stationed there , Plattsburgh for a while . He , he remembers lots of snow . Yeah , Plattsburgh 's kind of a , it 's , uh , it 's , uh , depressed economically . Oh , really , oh . 

When you go across the lake , um , I do n't know why we have so much going for us , I really do n't . I 'm , just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at Digital and they 've never had , well , they 've had layoffs recently , but when we got hired here , no , no , never any layoffs , never , never , and now we 're looking at serious , I , I mean , I 'm a technician . Yeah . When they start getting rid of technicians , Yeah , well , I 'm , I 'm working for T I , Texas Instruments , down here . Well , I interviewed with them . Oh , yeah ? But I did n't want to go to Texas . Oh , . Even though my , um , mother 's people are from Georgia . Oh , Yeah . yeah . Well , I guess we have to get back to hobbies since , Yeah , 

we 're getting to where , Stick on the subject . we 're straying , I guess , yeah . Well , interesting thing that I do is with , gardening , uh , my sister grows flowers that you can dry , Uh-huh . and you can make fl- , uh , dried flower arrangements and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun . 

And we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with , uh , dried red flowers and dried white flowers and , uh , eucalyptus . Huh , yeah . Yo- , you know what eucalyptus is ? It 's , Yeah , yeah , 

the , they s , uh , it 's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries . Yeah , it 's got a s- , It 's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it but , Yeah , at first I 'm like , oh , how , why do people like this , but it , it is kind of a nice smell after a while . People put them in , Yeah , I did n't realize what it was for a while . I 'd walk into a room where some of that , and I 'd wonder what is that , you know , and then one day I , I realized that it was eucalyptus . it 's , it 's , it 's , uh , like a fad thing . I , I do n't know . It 's , I 've never heard of it , in the last five years I 've used so much of it that , Yeah . I hate , Is that the stuff that koala bears eat in Australia or something ? Yeah , it is . Maybe that 's why they 're so slow . I guess they 're stoned on the stuff or something . Yeah , it , it looks really po , potent stuff . Yeah , yeah . 

But , uh , it 's , yeah , I think it 's the greatest stuff in the world , though . It 's , jeez , they , I make all kinds of things with it . We make all kinds of things just with dried flowers . I , I almost want to start a business doing it , but I do n't , I , I 'm so , uh , timid when it comes to starting a business . Yeah , 

that 's , that 's a big step , yeah . Yeah , it is , Yeah , uh , especially with the , being in on the creative a- , aspect and the crafty end . You know , after a while you make some stuff , then you start looking at it , go , boy , this , this is kind of ugly . But I know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby . Um , he does it , believe it or not , I would n't imagine why , but to get out of the house , away from his wife , because he 's a seasonal worker , he works in the construction . And up here it 's almost a pattern , and you see your fathers do it , then their sons do it . What they do is they work construction , then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter . And , uh , this guy was going nuts , and his , uh , son built him a garage and got him some , uh , oh , I do n't know what the equipment 's called , but planers and things -- Uh-huh , -- and -- shapers and planers and -- -- s , set him up , and h- , he makes , -- routers . all kinds of furniture for , um , his kids , and he makes , uh , uh , like little kids ' furniture . He gets right into it and , uh , 

There was a program on T V down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little , little companies of one and two guys , you know , up there , espec- , this particular one , I think , was in Maine and New Hampshire , where out in the , just kind of out in these little towns they 'd be in , they may be the same kind of people you 're talking about . You know , they 've , they 've got twelve weeks to do something , and they , they 're making furniture and just , you know , things like that during the winter and then they go off and do other things during the summer . Yeah , it 's a , So , yeah , it 's a really , Yeah , yeah . good thing because it 's keeping him sane , Yeah . and plus it 's keeping his marriage , Yeah . so , and , and plus he 's getting on in his years now . He 's , he 's not that old , 

but he 's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost , Yeah . to , to do something like that . And , uh , it 's really , it 's , it 's , uh , hard work . I could n't imagine taking lumber , raw lumber and trying to make something out of it . He d , That would be really t , you know , like say the , He dowels everything . Oh , man , yeah . 

And it 's all got to line up . It 's , and , uh , I do n't think he goofs too much , I do n't to , see too much scrap around . Yeah , yeah , that 's , that 's something . 

Now our temperatures down here , we 're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties -- God , I 'm envious . -- and , uh , so , and , uh , so as far as , you know , planting outdoor stuff , matter of fact , tonight I just got through , I was planting some , some trees out back tonight , and , uh , this is , uh , it 's really nice , Is it going to be , out tonight . Almost hated to come , you know . Is it going to be really dry ? Uh , are you pl , are you , now I always plant trees in the fall . I do n't know why so the , the cold weather can kill them -- Yeah , 

these were , uh , -- but I guess , trees that , that wintered . I do- , do n't know where they came from . They come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that . And they come down here and they 'll sit in the nurseries here and they 'll go ahead and , and , uh , leaf out . So what I 'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that 's , or trees that are already leafed out . Oh , that 's good . I guess they , they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall , all . Yeah . Mostly , I think in a place where it 's really cold they do it in the fall , 

let them winter -- Yeah . -- you know , through the fall , but , uh , down here , well , it 's done both ways . It , it just kind of depends on what you 're , what you 're planting , but , uh -- Yeah , 

and , uh , -- all the shrubs and , when you have time to do it . Yeah . My sister does , uh , flower gardens . She gets right into it . Uh-huh . She spends lots of money on them . And I guess a lot of people do , do do that . They landscape their whole house with flower gardens . Yeah . She 's got like , just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch ba- , tree bark all over her lawn . Yeah . Flowers , during the summer down here , the , the normal kind of flowers , there 's very few of them that will really do well . Everything does real well here in the spring until about , oh , first part of June and then the re- , the heat sets in . 

It gets , ya- , And June , July , August are , you know , most of the , those kind of plants just , are just barely staying alive , let alone make flowers . Do you have a lot of shade trees around your house or is it , Uh , we 're in a relatively new area . We 're kind of out of , uh , the natural tree area . We 're kind of up on a , on a higher , So you do n't have a lot of tree coverage ? on a slope . 

So we do n't have , where we are right now there are very few trees . Because goi , going to make , This was , this was , this was pasture land , but down the , down the hill here a little ways there are parks that are , look like jungles , you know . 

They 're really , Yeah . See , um , uh , where my , uh , well , my grandmother passed away , but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees , Uh-huh . and they just shade everything . Now where is this ? Uh , it 's in Georgia . In Georgia , yeah , yeah . It 's , yeah , it 's right outside of Macon , and , and it 's just a , I like the way that , I like the way that idea of the south is , but when I think of Texas , I think of nothing but , no trees and just grass . Well , I tell you what , now , see , East Texas , there 's two parts of Texas , East Texas and North Texas . Atlanta and Dallas are almost identical in every way , weather and everything . Yeah . The two cities are very , very identical , so if you were familiar with Atlanta , uh , So it 's that dry heat ? Uh , well , no , it 's , it 's , uh , not dry at all . It , it 's humid . Well , where is it , is it Hous- , was n't it Houston 's humid ? Hu- , Houston is awful . Yeah . Houston is really humid . No , It 's humid .
