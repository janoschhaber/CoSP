Well , uh , what is your favorite kind of music ? Well , I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be , uh , classical music . Oh , same here . Oh , really . Yeah . What type of music do you like in the classical area , or what era do you , era do you like the most ? 

Oh , well , I guess I like a wide range . Uh , everything from , uh , from Baroque through at least some modern music . Uh-huh . And my wife and I these days are especially into opera . We 've been sort of opera fans for a few years now . Um , do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages ? Well , we , uh , generally , the places we 've gone they sing in the original languages . Uh-huh . Like the Dallas opera here normally does , I guess . Uh-huh . I , I have n't gotten into that too much because , I , uh , if I do n't know the story line and , um , I do n't speak the language , then I have difficult time , comprehending what 's going on . Well , one thing that 's helped us a lot is that , uh , you , you know , you can buy a lot of these operas now on video casse- , uh , video tape -- Uh-huh . -- and so we have quite a collection of those , and you watch them at home , and they have subtitles , so you , you figure out what 's going on after a while , and then you can enjoy it in the , uh , theater . Oh . But , you know , the , uh , Dallas opera now has , uh , super titles on , on all their performances I think . What is that ? Well , they , they give an , uh , an English translation on a , on a screen up above the stage . 

Oh , I did n't know that . Yeah . That can help people like me . In fact , they even do that for operas sung , sung in English , because it is hard to understand the words sometimes . Well , I can understand that . So , I 'd say , Vivaldi is probably my favorite , uh , composer . Yeah , well , I really like Vivaldi . Uh , he 's , uh , definitely one of the , one of the top of that era . Yeah . I like Baroque music , I like full body music , uh , with the , um , um , with brass and winds , woodwinds , instruments , you know . Uh-huh . Course I like , uh , also string instruments , and I have two string instruments in my house . Uh , instrument players , both my sons play string instruments . One plays the cello and the other one plays the viola . Oh . So , I get to go to at least four or five concerts a year . Uh-huh . How , how old are they ? 

One is thirteen and one is eleven . So they 're doing this in school , or what ? Yes . Uh-huh . Yes MUMBLEx . Well , you 've got half a string quartet there . Yeah . We 're on our way . Yeah . So , uh , um , I try to enjoy all of it . Well , since you seem to like , uh , Italian music , have you ever , uh , gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era , the , uh , period right before , actually before Vivaldi , I guess ? Um , a little bit , but , um , a lot of the , um , music I do n't know about , uh , as far as the titles , 

and I have to listen to it , and -- Uh-huh . -- and figure out , what I 'm listening to . Um , I do belong to a Musical Heritage Society . Oh , yes , uh-huh . Do you belong to that ? No , I do n't , 

but I think I know what it is . Is n't that a , uh , uh , see , ca n't you get records through that or something , recordings ? You can get recordings . Uh , they know have them on compact disc or -- Uh-huh . -- or , uh , or cassettes or L P -s , 

and , uh , they do their , they do a lot of original recordings themselves . Yes , yeah , I think , uh . But they also , uh , they also , uh , go to the different composers , or the different , I guess , 

what do you call them the guys that orchestrate -- Uh . -- the con- , the conductors . Uh , yes , right . Yeah . They go to conductors , uh , and , and they actually have them perform the music , and they record it . So , they 're actually commissioned performances . Sure . A lot of them are . Uh-huh . Or they will kno , find out when they 're performing , and they will , uh , record the music at that time . And so , uh , it is , uh , uh , high quality grade music , and , of course , now they 're getting , they also have a jazz section , and they also have a , uh , more contemporary and American -- Uh-huh . -- uh , composer section . 

Well , I had go , heard good things about the , uh , Music Heritage Society , but if I get involved in one of those things , I end up spending all my money on -- Yeah . -- on music . Well , you can control it . I almost , uh , almost , uh , bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago . Oh , really . Yeah , my roommate signed me up . He got a bonus record , and I got a lot of bills . I see . So we have to watch that . Well , that 's good . Uh , do you play any instrument yourself ? Yes , I , I play guitar and , and early years played saxophone .
