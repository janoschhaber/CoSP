Uh , I 'm of the age that could have gone , although I did n't and , uh , I guess , uh , looking back on it , I tend to think it was pretty , uh , mostly a mistake . Uh-huh . On the other hand , uh , the more I learn about the history , the more I see it was incremental , uh , decisions . Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time . Uh-huh . And , uh , but on the whole I think it , uh , probably was the wrong thing to do . How about you ? 

Well , I 'm , uh , I , I was just , uh , in high school I guess when it , when it ended . Uh-huh . Ended up being , I was in the last , last lottery . Yeah . And I was glad it was over by then . Right . I 've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there . Just because , you know , we did n't really do anything when we went over it seems like . Yeah . You know , we , uh , those people that I know , I work with several that were over there , and for some of them it was just kind of , I do n't know , not so much a holiday , I guess that 's how they tend to talk about it . But that they just kind of lived out in the woods and ever now and then , they 'd go and shoot their rifles and then they 'd , come back and you know . But that they were n't really allowed to do anything . I , uh , to me it seems like we only went halfway . If even halfway . Yeah , it 's funny . 

Tonight I was , uh , helping my kid with an essay on , uh , Stalin . And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it , how , uh , in World War Two , the personalties of Stalin , Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war , it was , uh , it was almost a personal struggle among these three , uh , I guess you 'd have to call them great men in some sense . Uh-huh . Uh , they 're certainly all leaders and , uh , and , uh , with their nations pretty , pretty solidly behind each one of them . Yeah . And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the , uh , early decisions of the Vietnam war . That the , uh , people saw the cold war as , uh , you had to draw a line and , and defend it . Otherwise there 'd be , they 'd get you someplace else . Uh-huh . Looking back , it seems like that was only partly true . That , uh , there might have been a better place to draw the line . Uh , I guess you can , I guess you can say that a , a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight , uh , brought the cold war to an end . But I do n't think you can just fight anywhere just , just in order to , uh , call the bully out and beat him . And I have a feeling that that 's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war . They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line , beat them and they would n't come forward . And , uh -- -- we were wrong . But I , uh , you know , the , like I said , the more I hear about it , the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable . But the accumulative effect was to really get into a , a hopeless situation where , and as you say , uh , going halfway was probably worse than , uh , committing , uh , committing to a completely and , uh , winning it , whatever that would mean . Yeah . Well , I , I , I think we did , I think we did learn some lessons that we were n't , uh , we were n't prepared for , I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war . Yeah . 

Uh , I mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war . I mean -- Yeah . -- they seemed like a valiant thing . You knew , you knew who was good . You knew who was bad . Yeah . And it was a , it was a traditional m- , the traditional battle of , kind of good versus evil , if you , you know -- Well you 're not , -- whichever way it is . But in , in the Vietnam war it seems like it was , a , a , the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who 's good and who 's bad and -- It 's ambivalent , yeah . -- and , uh , you know , the , even , it seems like even the people , you know , had the South Vietnamese , the North Vietnamese and , of course , the Laotians and the Cambodians were n't even supposed to be involved . But , What , what about the domestic effects 

like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it , uh , possible and even popular to , uh , criticize the government . And they , that pendulum started to swing , uh , ma- , maybe even too far . To the point where , uh , uh , supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional -- Yeah . -- from the Vietnam war on . Yeah . And that tradition is still , I mean it 's dying now , but it 's still alive as opposed to , this Desert Storm stuff may have , uh -- Yeah . . -- killed it . But I think that was one of the biggest , that , you know , the , uh , th- , the domestic unrest ,
