Uh , well , uh , the Cowboys are my favorite team . That 's pretty easy to say nowadays . Lot easier than it was a couple years ago , but they had a big win today . Uh , did you get to watch it ? No , I did n't . I , uh , have been at my computer all day so , Oh . 

Are you a Cowboy fan ? Well , I used to be a real big Cowboy fan and , and , uh , I 'm not a Jimmy Johnson fan . Being an Okie -- Right , yeah . -- I just really do n't care much , uh , it 's , it 's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan , though . Uh-huh . They 've always been , you know , my favorite . Right . But , uh , and -- Yeah . -- and I guess I still have a soft spot . I just hate that that 's the coach -- Right . -- that 's leading them . Right . So , now have they , they 're in the playoffs , right ? Yeah , they made it to the playoffs finally like just , you know , two years ago they were one and fifteen . They won like just one game and so pretty fast turnaround . But this year they made it to playoffs and today was the first game and they beat the Chicago Bears 

so everybody 's really going crazy , you know , down here . I 'll bet they are . They 're going crazy , so , so they turned it around , 

but , you know , they have a lot of young exciting players now , uh , I mean , everybody was real upset , you know , when they fired Tom Landry , but , you know , now it 's like , you know , they 're doing good so everybody 's forgotten about that . Uh , football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world . Uh-huh . 

Hit a bad season and it 's , you know , the coach 's fault , let 's , let 's dump him . Right . First good season , the coach can do no wrong . Right , exactly . But they -- 

You know . -- Dallas has always been good ahead , you know , heading good players and -- Uh-huh . -- both running , running backs and , and defense . Right , yeah , uh , you know , they have a young team . 

It 's , you know , a lot different than the teams they used to have where it 's the same old , you know , players every year and , you know , same coach , same everything , so , now it 's , you know , like a taste of something different . They 're all not , you know , mister nice guys like they used to be . Now it 's like , you know , tough and dirty team so everybody is really excited . And , 

Who is the competition going to be ? Well , it 's supposed to be the Redskins , but you know , we beat them already . We beat them this year in , in Washington so , you know , so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl , but , you know , it 's just that we have to play every game away , you know , it 's going to be tough , but , but every- , the competition is , are teams that they 've already beat this year , so , I mean , Atlanta , they 're in it , too , and we beat them and , uh , see , Detroit , we play them next week , but , you know , we should beat them . Everybody feels like we should be able to beat them so , it 's , so everything 's , uh , looking real good . Course , I think , you know , you ca n't really go by what happened earlier in the season -- Uh-huh . Right . -- injuries that heal and , you know -- Right . -- it can be a tot- , or injuries that , uh , have newly happened -- Right . -- and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played . Yeah , well the Cowboys are on a roll . They 've won , like , I think six or seven in a row now , 

so they 're supposed to be the hottest team in the , in the league going into the playoffs so , But , but since you have an O U drop out as a quarterback , Right , yeah , Troy Aikman , he got hurt at O U , 

so he transferred -- Well , -- to U C L A . Well , he , he really did n't feel like he 'd be able to do a lot of passing at O U . Right . O U has always been known for their running game . Uh-huh . More than , They 're playing tonight in fact . Right . I 'm watching them on T V right now . But they 're doing some stomping on Virginia . Oh , I tell you , they 've , they 've not had much of a team this year , bless their little hearts . Really ? Well , they 're doing good tonight . Are they ? Yeah -- I have n't -- -- they 're winning . -- been watching . They 're winning forty-one to seven . Well , good -- Yeah . -- for us . Right . Oh . But , yeah , and , uh , that 's right , Aikman did go to O U . I forgot about that . Yeah , they h- , then he went out to S , to southern Cal . Is that where he went ? Yeah , uh , U C L A . Yeah . Yeah . So , But , the Cowboys did good today . I mean , I was proud . I thought , I thought they would get beat today because , I mean they 're so young , you know , playoffs ,
