Okay . Uh , so , what do you think , uh , about putting the elderly in a nursing home ? Well , I think that it , it varies on on the individual basis . Huh . 

Uh , sometimes it is , there is no alternative . Uh-huh . Uh , you do not have , uh , uh , family available or family that 's , uh , you may not even have family that is , uh , uh , in , you know , who are around . 

That 's true . Yeah . So , sometimes it 's not an alternative . Huh . And I think , uh , but I think also , sometimes it can be , uh , a benefit if it 's for a short time . Sometimes in a nursing home -- Uh-huh . -- uh , especially if , if it 's after an acute illness . To get over a , or to rehab after , uh , an illness . That 's true . I never thought of that . Yeah . Sometimes you know , sometimes the nursing homes are good for , uh , just short periods of time . That 's true , 

until they get over that hump -- Uh-huh . -- of whatever it is they 're dealing with . Because too often the acute hospitals will , are sending them out much faster than what they 're -- Yes . -- really able to . 

They really are . They do n't like to keep them -- So -- -- longer than a week . -- so there is some good to it . Yeah . Uh , sometimes too , it 's used as a dumb job . You know the fam- , -- What do you mean ? -- well the families do not necessarily , uh , know what to do with them and they do n't want to take the responsibility so they will put them in a nursing home . Yeah , that 's true . So you see , uh , there 's both sides to it too . What do you think ? Yeah 

and it depends on how , how sick the person is too . What you 're capable of , like if you have a family to take care of , you know , of your own . Yeah . Yeah , uh , I would personally like it if my parents were to get ill , I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help . That 's not always possible . That 's true . But , uh , to the best of my ability , I 'd like to do it until it gets impossible . I think that 's also where you 're going to have a lot of people who are going to , it 's there 's not a choice , it 's -- Right . -- because , it 's not economically feasible even to -- Uh-huh . -- put them in a nursing home . Yeah . So that , that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the , uh , either Medicare or insurance to cover it . 

That 's true . Yeah . So , But I think nursing homes can be good . It just depends on what kind they are . You know , you need to check them out ahead of time . Yeah , 

and then there 's also some that are set up for specialties -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I know some . Unfortunately , some elderly have to go to or have , I guess it 's Alzheimer 's or where -- Uh-huh . -- they wonder or , or , uh , confused or have some mental problem . Yeah , that they 're , And you need a special nursing home for that . You need one that has a unit that 's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around -- Yeah . -- and you need people who are trained for that type -- Right . -- of problem . Who know what they 're doing with that . Yeah 

so , so there 's different types of nursing homes I think . Yeah well , my , uh , grandmother 's not really in a nursing home , but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it . And she really liked the idea of , of moving there . She 's not ill yet -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years and then she decided that , uh , she 's eighty five years old , that eventually , you know , she she does n't want her family taking care of her and being a burden . She 's very independent . So she 's in this nursing home . It 's out in the country and , uh , she really enjoys it right now because she does n't have to wash dishes or cook . Gives her a little bit of her own independence -- Uh-huh . -- but she still has , uh , a security there . Right . 

Some support . And then there 's also , uh , sort of a wing for those people that do get sick and , what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now and then , so if she ever does become ill , uh , it will be like family around her . 

That 's right and I -- Yeah . -- I 've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of , uh , activities going on for the ones -- Uh-huh . -- who are more active . Yeah . Sh- , So it 's not sort of like , uh , uh -- Uh-huh . -- a sick place . No , she loves it . She has a great social life and she travels and , uh , it 's in , in the very in the mountains and it 's beautiful and , uh , I , I hope that I have something like that when I get older . Yeah I , I think , I think the , uh -- Uh-huh . -- I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the , uh , elderly -- Uh-huh . -- uh , person who 's going in and the family that 's going to be , uh , effec , effected by it -- Oh definitely it 's , 

-- and , uh , you know , sometimes it can , those choi- , those choices can be made in advance and sometimes -- Right . -- the choices because of the nature of the illness when they 're ,
