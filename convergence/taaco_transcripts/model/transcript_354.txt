Hi . So , uh , what was the last car repair you had ? Just recently I was kind of laughing when I , when I heard the switchboard talking about the question because , uh , I had to have my , uh , radiator flushed -- Oh . -- and it was getting rusty . And the thing that they forgot to do was to , um , to also look at the hose , and I had gone about oh , two days with my new radiator flushed and the hose burst . 

So I was stranded out on the highway . Oh , no . Did you crack the block or what ? No , I , I did n't do that thank goodness , 

but , uh , there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there , you know , left to do that but it cost me all kind of money , you know , to have that repaired after they said they were going to , they had repaired it . So that was , that was a horrible experience -- Yeah , I see . -- just recently . You got lucky you did n't ruin the whole engine though . Yes , yes . That can be pretty serious . I know . I know . What about you ? Oh , I guess it 's been awhile for me . I 'd sa , it 's been about a year . Uh-huh . Yeah , I had the , uh , the water pump break on my car . Oh . Yeah , I was traveling , uh , 

I was going on my way home from Thanksgiving -- Uh-huh . -- and it broke like in the middle of nowhere . Uh-huh . So , I had to get it towed and then fixed and -- Uh-huh . -- big pain . 

Oh , oh , I know . I know . Especially when you 're out on the highway . Yeah , that 's where I was . 

Luckily someone came by and gave me a ride . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . I know , well , you know , uh , living in Dallas , you know we 've got , uh , bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic and , uh , that was , that was horrible . Yeah . You know to have the , you know , your car is fuming and everything . It 's already a hundred degrees you do n't need that too . Oh , shoot . But my car is getting old . See it 's about six years old now , so . Yeah , so is mine . Yeah , so I got it right out of college and so it 's , uh , it 's starting to show the wear and tear now . Yeah , I 'm hoping mine gets me through . I got until May until I 'm out . So when I cross that one I 'll be okay . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Yeah , that , uh , that was my graduation present to myself , so . Oh , that 's nice . Yeah . Yeah , I know so but gosh , it 's really starting to , to wear 

so I 've been thinking , especially now is a good time to buy a car . Yeah . Go- , because I ca n't , uh , I do n't know if I want to , you know , pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it 's starting to breakdown . Yeah , I do n't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is and it 's not worth it . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Yeah , that 's true . I agree with you there . Yeah . 

So I do n't know , uh , because I , I need to have it tuned , you know , tuned up and I do n't know , replace some of the belts . And I was looking at the , uh , tires need to be replaced and so I was thinking just a lot of money I 'm , might as well buy me a new car for that . Yeah , I got new tires last winter too so I 'm like , well , that 's the last major purchase for this thing . It 's not worth it . Uh-huh . Well , you have to , in Pennsylvania , boy , you have to really have your car winterized and stuff , huh ? Yeah . Uh-huh . Yeah , we get some killer winters up here in the mountains . Oh , really ? Yeah . Oh , okay . So , Lot of snow and a lot of cold . Uh-huh . Well , especially do n't you have what , a lot of salt on the ground ? Yeah , at times there 's a lot of it . Uh-huh . 

You got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance . Yeah . Yeah , well , rust and the , and the body too , huh ? Yeah , I have n't had a big problem with that though . Uh-huh . So I 've been pretty lucky there . Well , I think they get the new Z-bart stuff and everything to where you can , um , Yeah , that 's usually pretty good . You just rinse it off after the winter is over and -- Uh-huh . -- done with it . Yeah , and go like that so . Yeah . I usually like to do most repairs on my own though . Do you ? Yeah , 

just because that way I know what 's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really does n't . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Yeah . Plus if something goes wrong , I know who to blame . Well , I , I think I 'm getting too old for all that . 

My , uh , I had four brothers and they used to drag me out underneath the car , and stuff so I can , I can do all that stuff but I , I think I 'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to , to go have it done now so I can get my hands dirty . So , yeah . I 'm just getting , getting to that age I guess . You just do n't have , your time becomes very precious so working on the car is just not one of those things I want to spend my time on anymore . More fun things to do . Absolutely , absolutely . So , yeah , 

I 'm trying to , you know , I just need one , I had two cars there for a while so I would n't have to worry about which car was going to run . Well , that 's nice . 

And yeah , so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them . Yeah . And yeah , so that , 

One is bad enough . Yes , one was bad enough . But I think I got rid of the wrong one . I soon , I need a lot of repairs done on , on this one so yeah , that was , uh , that was something else . Well , are our five minutes up ? . Yeah , I was just wondering that . 

I , I did n't , I did n't set the time or anything to , uh , Yeah , I did n't either . Yeah , put , Yeah , this must be a , a hard category . Well , yeah , I guess . Um , you know , 

unless you 're , um , you know , big do-it-yourselfer . Um , to , you know , fix up your own cars and , and things like that . So , but I guess they were talking about experiences . You know , I , uh , uh , I did , my parents live in Ohio so I , I do know something about the , you know , the really cold weather . And , uh , I 've always lived down here in the south , and , oh , I took my car up there to their house and , um , I guess I had a crack in the block , and when I got up there the car ,
