Okay , what do you think about , uh , the self insurance business ? Well , I watched something on T V a couple of months ago by , uh , General , ex , uh , Surgeon General Koop . Uh-huh . And he talked about Canada 's system 

and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that , but the expensive stuff , heart , uh , operations and things , they have a managed scarcity . And they said that in Canada , there were as many heart , uh , trauma centers as there is in San Francisco . So in one city of , in America , there 's as many , uh , hospitals that are equipped to do hosp- , uh , heart operations as in the entire area of Canada , and that 's kind of spooky . Well , I , uh , I understand what you 're saying , and there 's probably some truth to that . 

I think that , uh , generally I do n't welcome added government responsibilities . However , when a , anybody ca n't police their own profession , it eventually leads to that , and I think the costs and the , uh , the way the medical profession has , every year I , being in my own business , uh , in the last six years , every year there 's been at least minimum twenty-five percent increase in health insurance costs , and I think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance , as , as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter . Uh-huh . Uh , I think they 're asking for it . I , I think the medical profession is just , just pushing until there 's no option but the government take it over and , uh , 

Do you think that it 's just , uh , medical guys ? What about , you know , you know how expensive new equipment and technology is . That 's where I think most of the cost is coming . 

Well , I , I think a lot of it is , uh , I , I do n't disagree totally with that , but , uh , my wife this last summer , uh , when we were on vacation tore up her knee , and , uh , uh , it was lig- , ligaments , uh , in her knee , Uh-huh . as it turned out , uh , she came back that , uh , we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened and , uh , she got home , and the leading orthopedic man , who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come , I mean , he knows knee problems okay , Uh-huh . I mean if anyone does , this guy knows it . Well , she goes in , he says , well , I think this is what it is , but , uh , you better go to the hospital and have one of these M R I things . A thousand dollars for this , uh , oh , magnetic , uh , resonance imaging type thing . And my wife said , well , do I need that ? And he says , well , uh , you know , it , it 'll help me diagnose this . I mean , uh , you know , I , I suggest you go have this thing . Insurance wo n't pick this up unless you 're in the hospital . Now , a , 

Oh , great . thousand , uh , uh , dollars for thirty-five minutes . I mean , doctors routinely send people in for anything . Now , for years they did n't have this and they solved these problems , and , you know , Yeah . I said to her , well , look , you know , if you feel you got to go , go , but I , I think a thousand dollars , these guys , I do n't know what it is , but there 's , Uh-huh . no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day . And even if they cost a hundred , two hundred , five hundred thousand dollars , at , uh , roughly a thousand dollars every half hour , uh , that 's ridiculous . I , I do n't care what anyone says . You know , the costs are not , it 's a picture . It should n't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that , you know , reasonableness . But they are n't reasonable . Fifty , a hundred dollars . They do n't have to pay them back in three months time . No . Yeah , I 'll have to agree , You know . with you there , but there 's another problem , and that 's the , how litigious our society is . 

If the doctor makes a mistake , he can be sure that he 's going to be hauled into court . Well , I think that should be , that , that 's a , another problem , but that 's part of our legalese problem . And that , the government eventually will address too just , you know , because it 's out of control . I , I agree with you . You know , uh , I was on a jury or I , I did n't make the jury , but there was a ,  deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant . Uh-huh . Like it was three days after it was born , and he was the one that delivered it . And they got four attorneys , one guy out of Houston , he introduced himself as snake so-and-so , and he says , well , anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars , and I says , yeah , I got problems with . I mean , you know , five million bucks is n't going to bring this kid back , you know , I mean , as sorrowful as it is . Uh , you know , if the doctor is wrong , you know , he should be pulled from his license , but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it , you know , it , it does n't make logical sense to me , but , uh , No , it does n't . Uh , that 's ,
