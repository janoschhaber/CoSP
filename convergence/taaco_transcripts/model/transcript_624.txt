Okay Randall , uh , uh , do you have any special interest in , uh , space flight ? Oh yeah . 

Ever since I was a young and , uh , used to watch the old , uh , Apollo missions going off in , uh , classroom T V -s . Uh-huh . Uh , I suspect a lot of people , uh , uh , got , uh , turned on by watching , watching those go off . Uh-huh . Uh , very exciting . Yeah . The , uh , uh , I 've al- , I 've always , uh , w , wanted very much , uh , to , uh , be somehow involved in all that . Uh-huh . And , uh , to , uh , meet and , and to see , see it actually happen . Of course , I 've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday . Uh-huh . But , uh , that seems rather unlikely at this point , unfortunately . 

What do you do now ? Uh , computer programmer . Oh . Unfortunately , that can be done from the ground . Yeah . To bad , huh . Yeah . Made the wrong , wrong career choice to get up into space . The , uh , uh , I used to think when I was , when I was younger that , uh , by this time we 'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Uh , frustrating at times . Uh-huh . I do n't know what you think about all that . 

Well , uh , yo- , I , uh , I 'm kind of young . I 'm only twenty-two and so , uh , uh , I 'm not , you know , there 's a lot that 's happened in my lifetime as far as , uh , you know , with the space shuttle and all . Although plans to , uh , go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to , uh , the sixties . Uh-huh . Uh , although I have a , Yeah . -- and whatnot , it would be great -- -- if we could find some way to , to , uh , use that to boost the economy . Yeah . 

Well , the , uh , uh , I 've always , uh , felt that , uh , uh , one of the long-term solutions that , at least a few of our problems would be to have , uh , some sort of , uh , solar power satellites up . Uh-huh . Uh , because that 's a , uh , you know , in singularly renewable resource that does n't do it , that does n't require , uh , uh , any particularly nasty environment impact . Exactly . And you can just get as much power as you need up there . Uh-huh . It 's just a matter of how big you build it . Uh-huh . Uh , and , of course , the side effects of this is that you have to have , uh , lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no MUMBLEx things that I think we should be doing . So the side effects of doing that which I think would be good , you know , very , very good for al- , for everyone in the long run is , uh , is it , some of the other things I 'd like to see happen would happen also , so I 'm , Right . Yeah . 

It seems like , uh , there 's , so you 're talking about positive side effects then . Yeah , right . Okay , I understand . Right . Sure , that makes a lot of sense . Right . The only problem is , of course , that , uh , that requires significant commitment -- Uh-huh . -- from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there . Yeah . And they want to do the research and -- Yeah . -- uh , they 're all you know , nor- , the only commitments that they 're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like , uh , the trip to Mars . Right , exactly . Which is , would , would produce some useful scientific research and so forth , but the same money could probably be far better spent on , uh , uh , lunar bases and solar power satellite research and , you know , so forth . Uh-huh . It , it would de- , it would be being done for the , uh , glitz and show factor -- Uh-huh . -- to get politician votes instead of , instead of for , you know , we should eventually send someone , people to Mars but not just because it 's glitzy to do so . Right . We should do it because , for , for the return we get for it . Uh-huh . And , uh , unfortunately , that 's not what I thinks happened . Exactly . Least not , I , I would settle for the gli- , MUMBLEx for the glitz if the side effects were useful , like the , uh , but , uh -- Yeah . -- the downside of that is you , after you do one of those , people say well we did it . Right . Now let 's -- Now we 're done . -- now we 're done . No need to use this anymo- , to play around with this space stuff anymore . That 's what happened with Apollo . Yeah . I think you 're right . But , uh , I 'd give almost anything to get into space . I would too . I 'd , I 'd , uh , was it John Denver that that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle ?
