Okay , what kind of hobbies do you have ? Um , mostly what I do , 

I do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing , and then I , I read a lot . Uh-huh . I like to read , too . I was trying to think of some while , while it was , uh , talking about it , and then I , it took so long for someone to answer , I started reading the -- Oh . -- newspaper , and kind of forgot about it . But , uh , yeah , 

I 'd say reading is probably one of my biggest ones , because it 's the type of thing that you can , you can do a little bit at a time , whereas , I would love to do crafts and stuff if I just had the time to do it -- Uh-huh . -- or if I had the space . I live in a pretty small apartment , and , uh , I would have to , you know , put stuff away . I have two cats , so I could n't really leave it out if I was working on something . Uh-huh . Reading is a little bit easier to work around . Yeah , you can pick it up and take it wherever you go . That 's right . MUMBLEx any MUMBLEx space . I get too involved in reading sometimes that I neglect what I should be doing . That 's true , I do the same thing . You get so involved in what you 're reading . What types of crafts do you do ? I do a little bit of woodworking , well , I used to . I do n't have the equipment here . We moved to Dallas about a year ago -- Uh-huh . -- and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment -- Uh-huh . -- and I did some of that . Um , here I 've mostly done things that I can do strictly by hand , um , sewing and quilting and , um , what else have I done ? 

Things to hang on the wall . Uh-huh . Mostly just stuff that I can , you know , use right around the house -- Uh-huh . -- or give away as gifts . Right . I 've been making a lot of quilts , well , not a lot , but several quilts lately . Uh-huh . So . I enjoy , uh , sewing and needlework also . I 've , I 've , uh , made some small things , cross stitch things . And , um -- Uh-huh . -- back when I was in high school , I worked at a needlework shop , and I , I used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that , and I , I still remember how to do it . 

It 's just been so long since I 've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that . But I have recently done some cross stitch . Uh-huh . And I enjoy doing that . It 's just the same old thing , it 's just getting the time to do it . Yeah . 

I 've done some cross , um , cross stitch , but I never count right , and I always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered -- Uh-huh . -- or , or something . It never has worked out completely . Yeah , it takes a lot of concentration . I mean , it was the type of thing , I was , I was making some little things for Christmas , and I also made a little thing for a baby gift , and , uh , I thought , Oh , I can do this while I watch T V . Wrong . Right . No , you must pay all attention to what you 're doing . It 's , it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be . It took me , uh , quite a bit of time . I though , Oh , this wo n't take long at all . But -- Uh-huh . 

-- I was wrong . It took , it took a while to do . But , it was fun , I enjoyed it . Yeah . The first project I started out one was a big one , 

it was , uh , it was of a lady and she was kneeling , and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe . Oh my gosh . And I , it was just too much to start with . And I still have n't finished it , because I , I stopped , and I thought I better do some simple things and work up to this -- Uh-huh . 

-- because it was just so difficult -- Yeah . -- to get it done . And there were so many different shadings and colors , and , and , it was just too much to begin with . And I think kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it . Yeah . That 's pretty understandable . And I 've done some of the crewel and the , um -- Uh-huh . -- something similar to that but it does n't have the specific stitches . Anyway , it 's a little bit more loose , and not quite as structured , and I like that a little bit better -- Uh-huh . -- the variety of stitches and stuff in that . More like embroidery or something . 

I 'm trying to think of anything else I do as a hobby . Um . I do n't even watch T V very much . I was tonight , but , Yeah . I was reading when you called . Yeah . How about movies , do you like to go to movies ? Yeah I do , I do like to go to movies , and I have a V C R , so I like to rent movies , and , um , I have , right now I have the movie channel , so I 've recorded quite a few movies off of that . Um , just , I 've kind of got a collection going of tapes now , and whenever I go visit my parents , they 're always saying , Well , bring some of your tapes . They always borrow a few of them . I was over there , they live in Duncanville -- Uh-huh . -- and I was over there at Easter , and they said , Bring some tapes with you . So they are always borrowing my tapes . Yeah . But , uh , Well we , I like to , I like to do , uh , stuff with plants . I like , um , I have a lot of plants in my apartment , and I 've got a pretty small porch , but it 's , it 's , uh , I 've got a few planters out there that I , I 'll , uh , you know , in the winter time I usually plant some pansies in there , and then in the summer I 'll plant petunias , 

or something that 's colorful and like , that blooms a lot . But -- Uh-huh . -- have n't done that yet . I kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time , but I think we 're probably past that now . I probably should go buy some . Yeah . I guess if I had a house I might enjoy gardening , some . I 'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that . Yeah , it 's the hard work . Yeah , I like the planting , and watering is okay . 

It 's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers , it 's so beau , I mean , we do n't . We live in an apartment also . Uh-huh . I 've got a few plants here , but I 'm not really knowledgeable . I feel real good if I water them and they continue to grow . You know , I feel like , Oh , I 've accomplished something . Uh-huh . So I enjoy it , but I 'm just not experienced enough with Yeah . I do n't know too much about it either . Mine 's pretty limited to my little , uh , porch plants . And then the ones in my apartment , half of which do n't look real healthy , but I do n't always get direct sun except in certain spots . Oh , yeah . And so that 's probably my problem there . But , 

Have you tried any , growing any , um , like fruits and vegetables or anything ? I guess vegetables are in , insi- , like in pots and stuff ? No , I never have tried that , just because I do n't have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment -- Uh-huh . -- or this little balcony . 

And my other two pots are , they 're kind of , they 're pretty big , and I have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area , so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood , there 's no room for much else . But my dad , uh , my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house . And I 'd , I think when I was real little I probably had a finger in on that every time he did it -- Uh-huh . -- and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff . But I 've never really tried anything like that since then . Well , I considered it last year and this year both , but I have n't done anything about it . Uh-huh . 

So . I think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch . We get lots of sunlight here , and the porch is screened in and it 's pretty large . Oh , wow . So , um , I think if I just would be , if I 'd do something , be motivated enough to do something , I think it would work out well . Uh-huh . 

But , but there goes that motivation thing again . Right . Well , I enjoy playing with my cats . I do n't know if you 'd call that a hobby , but I have two cats , and I gave them a bath tonight , so they 're a little bit angry at me . MUMBLEx . Can you -- They did n't like it too much . -- can you put them right in the water ? Yeah , 

oh yeah -- Oh , that 's good , -- right in the tub , 

and it helps because it 's the time of the year that they 're shedding a lot , and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine . So I thought , this 'll help , you know , help them shed , and sure enough , boy the fur just came off like crazy once I got them -- Oh , yeah . -- in the tub . So , they 're pretty content now , but they were mad at me for quite a while . They went and hid after they , after they got dried off . Sulked for a while , huh . Yeah . Well , I like animals , but we do n't have any yet . We have a nine month old with another on the way -- Uh-huh . -- and we thought , well maybe when they 're a little bit bigger -- Yeah . 

-- then we 'll , or get into a house with a little more space . I 'd love to have , have some animals . Uh-huh . But I like dogs and my husband likes cats . So we have n't reached a real agreement on that yet . If we get a place where we can have both , it 'll be great , but until then , Yeah , I like both , 

but since I 'm in an apartment , I just , I do n't think an apartment is big enough for a dog . Dogs , to me , dogs need a yard , even little dogs . Uh-huh . They just need a yard . Cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine . But I just think dogs need , need to be outside , though . So , I agree with you . I , 

if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat , or even a bird or a fish tank or something , you know . Yeah , now that 's an idea -- Something small -- -- with the small babies . 

-- that she can watch , but wo n't take too much care . Yeah , because , you kind of , even , even a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something . Uh-huh . They 're not as likely to as a dog might , I guess . But with little ones , I 'd be kind of scared , to get anything that has teeth or claws . 

Especially when they 're not quite to the age of understanding that they 're hurting , you know , that they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk . Oh yeah . And if I was a cat or dog , I 'd respond probably by biting or something . I do n't know . Oh , yeah . That 'd be my self defense . But , Uh-huh . Well , I think we probably reached our time limit . Yeah , probably so , and I 'm out of , out of good ideas for a hobby anyway . 

Oh , okay . Well it was good talking to you . Thank you for calling . All right . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
