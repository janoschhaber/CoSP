So , uh , what kind of home repair work have you done ? Well , um , done a little , uh , repair on the , uh , shingles on the roof recently . We 've had a lot of wind around here . 

Been pulling them up , huh , or just loosening them until the rain came in ? Yes . It looks like I 'm going to have to get up there again , because we may have a leak . Are you in the section of Texas that 's been getting so much rain ? We 've been getting quite a bit , maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio , 

but , uh , well , I 'm right , Plano 's just north of Dallas -- Oh , okay . -- and there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas that are under water right now , I guess , I saw on the news . Yeah . 

But you 're probably , what , about halfway across the state from San Antonio , though , are n't you ? Well , we 're up , uh , we 're north -- Yeah . -- and , uh , oh , about , uh , I do n't know , uh , eighty to a hundred miles south of the Oklahoma line , I guess . Yeah , okay . 

But you 're still getting a good bit of the rain , though . Uh , we did have a little bit of rain yesterday . So far we have n't had any today . And , uh , I suppose that means I should be , uh , getting up there to look at that , uh , shingle , but , uh -- Yeah . -- I had something else planned today , so I guess I 'll let it go awhile . Yeah . Is it asphalt shingles , or , or MUMBLEx . They 're , uh , no , they 're , uh , wood shake . Ooh , 

that should be a lot of fun . Yeah . Did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them ? No , I , uh , as a matter of fact , we 've never had a leak actually yet . 

Now this , we just bought the house last year , and , uh , uh , just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles . So , I 've just recently had to start looking at it myself . Yeah . So , it 's a small problem so far , but I guess you just have to keep on top of it . What kind of roof do you have ? Uh , we 're in , uh , campus apartment buildings with flat top , uh . 

Oh , then you do n't have to do too much with it . Not too much . They 're just tar and gravel -- Uh-huh . -- treated flat top roofs . Have you got pretty well pitch on that roof , or is it pretty steep ? Oh , it 's pretty steep . Uh , parts of it are steeper than others . What do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal ? 

Well , uh , you wear , uh , shoes with good traction , and , and , and try to remember where you are at all times . Yeah , I imagine , I imagine . And remember to yell Geronimo , if all else fails . Yeah , yeah , that would be just too much of a fall for me . Um , have you been , uh , was , was the house reasonably new , or you been doing some remodeling work on it . It 's actually just twelve years old , now . 

That 's pretty new house yet . Yeah , it , uh , this part of the country , actually , they say that when the house is , uh , fifteen , it 's already old , but just take good care of it . Yeah . Thing is , we 've , uh , the main thing that we 've had with this house recently has been some , uh , squirming , I call it , of the foundation . We 're just on a concrete slab , you know -- Yeah . -- but , uh , the soil right under this is a clay , and it , uh , It 's settling unevenly ? Well , it , uh , depending on its moisture content , it either swells up or shrinks , and , uh -- Yeah . -- of course the soil right under the slab retains its moisture a lot longer -- Uh-huh . -- and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from , uh , from , uh , drooping -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , but anytime there 's a change in the weather , like the temperature , drastic changes in temperature or in , uh , moisture , uh , you get little spider web cracks all around , uh , windows and doors . Well , that sounds like a lot of fun . Well , usually what you do is just wait until you think it 's stopped , 

and then you patch them up . Um . What is it like , uh , stucco walls or , Uh , well , this is all , uh , it 's all drywall -- Oh , drywall . -- uh , I think , with , uh -- Wood framing ? -- yeah , right . Okay . But , uh , somehow or other that does manage to , uh , show these little cracks . I do n't know quite how that works . Maybe it is n't drywall . I do n't really know . MUMBLEx they plastered over drywall . Yeah , I think it is . 

I remember my parents home is drywalled and then they , uh , almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall -- I expect that 's what it is , yeah . -- to give it a textured sort of a look , and made for kind of a hard shell on the , on the drywall . Yeah , I think that 's the way this is done . 

Fortunately we have n't had any real big holes in it yet so I , Yeah , that 's good . Yeah . Yeah , that would , that would be in terribly , terribly exasperating to have the , the slab floor like that swelling and giving like that . Yes , well , the previous owner had a major problem with it , because , uh , oh probably a variety of things . His neighbor used ,
