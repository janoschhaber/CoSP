MUMBLEx , how do you feel about crime in the city ? You say you 're from Atlanta . Right , I , I , I actually I live in the city -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , I guess it is a concern of mine , uh , you know , for my own safety . Uh-huh . 

I mean , do you , do you find crime in Atlanta really MUMBLEx I live in Atlanta also . Well that 's right . Uh . 

Uh , I think it is bad in certain areas , however I think , the area that I live in it 's not , uh , the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the , of the city . Uh-huh . I think it seems that there 's certain areas where , uh , the crime is focused -- Uh-huh . -- uh . 

Well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city ? Well , I think it 's , what 's been happening over the last several years it seems they 've been beefing up the police patrols , trying to put , put more guys , more cops , higher visibility , and , uh , -- Uh-huh . -- they 've had some impact , but not a tremendous amount , and probably , um , they need to try to increase community involvement , that sort of thing , I think MUMBLEx . I probably agree with that . Yeah . Uh . You know , particularly in some of the housing projects , uh , you know , that 's , that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused -- Uh-huh . -- and they 've got to do more than just having , having cops there . They 've got to kind of change the way people think about it . Yeah , that 's probably true . Um , so , um , well do you think Atlanta 's as bad as most other cities ? Um , well , I 've been to , I 'd say it 's , it 's probably in the top , top ten in terms of crime . Um , it 's nowhere near as bad as New York City -- Uh-huh . -- for example . Probably not , not as bad as Detroit . Uh-huh . 

I do n't think it 's as bad as L A either . No . We , I do n't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have . Yeah , that seems to be true . Um , yeah , if you 've ever been to like New York City and -- Uh-huh . 

-- you can just , you can just , as you walk through the street on a given evening , you can see crimes being committed . Uh-huh . It 's that obvious . Yeah , I do n't know , 

I came to the conclusion also that , you know , just , if you are walking in a downtown area , you know , where there 's a lot of crime , a lot of that 's going to just , just keeping your senses about you and , and trying not to look like a victim , you know . Yeah , that 's true . You know , walk bi- , you know , walk with , you know , with -- With a big stick or . 

-- MUMBLEx just walk in a confidently , and , you know , do n't , do n't be -- Right . -- looking around like you 've never been there before -- Sure . -- and you have no idea where you are . Right , do n't , do n't walk down a , an alley or do n't get -- Yeah . -- just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation -- Uh-huh . -- but , yeah , there are times when you ca n't avoid all that -- Uh . -- and , and then you 're kind of on your own . Yeah . MUMBLEx have you , have you ever , have you ever been mugged in Atlanta ? Uh , no . 

The only thing I 've ever had , was I 've had my wallet lifted -- Uh-huh . -- but that was in a more of a , a setting where there was a number of people around , and I kind of got , I was much younger at the time -- Uh-huh . -- and kind of a couple of people , they just took it from me without me knowing really -- Uh-huh . -- and kind of passed it off , so I did n't know who had it . Uh-huh . I 've had that happen , but that 's , that 's about it . Yeah , I 've been pretty lucky about getting mugged . Um . Oh , yeah . Yeah , I think I 've only actually seen like one , you know , one actual robbery with a gun -- Um . -- and that 's been about the only , you know , real violent crime where , you know , potentially violent crime that I 've seen in Atlanta . Really , well , I 've had my . And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed . Uh-huh . I 've had my car stolen , so maybe that counts . Oh , really . Yeah . 

Oh , where was , where , where was that ? Was that downtown or , Oh no , that was in the northern p- , um , up near Cumberland Mall area . Really . It 's actually Cobb County , but it is Atlanta -- Metropolitan , yeah . -- and , uh , there 's a lot of car thefts in that area . Yeah , 

I 've actually , I 've known , known some people that have had their cars stolen . Uh , and , uh , and , you know , about half the time they seem to , the A P D seems to recover them , you know -- Right . -- in various states of disrepair . Yeah Up on blocks . My friend had a V W Rabbit , and when he , when he got it back his , um , dashboard was sitting in the front seat . Yeah , mine was just , it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage , but they did n't , they did n't strip it -- Uh-huh . -- so I got it back . 

Well , you 're probably luckier than . Yeah , than most . Uh-huh . Um , so like does insurance pay for the body damage , or -- Right . -- was that all there was , body . It was about three grand to put everything together . They cracked the steering column of course , to steal the car . Yeah , you got to , you crack the steering column and you pull the , 

there 's a pin in there that you can pull on these G M cars -- Uh-huh . -- and you can start it up , basically pretty easily . Uh-huh . So how do you know this much about , um , stealing cars ? Well , after I found mine I had to , I had this ,
