Well Carol since today 's subject is our homes , why do n't you tell me about yours . Okay , I live in Plano , in a four bedroom , two bath house , which is the area 's dominantly three bedroom , two bath . So , I 'm just a little bit different than typical , uh , and of course , the Plano area is basically with alleyways , 

so everything around here is set up that way . Which I think is a little bit different than most areas , in the houses , the way they 're constructed . And it 's a brick house , with , uh , some wood . It 's real nice , I like it . How about you ? Well I , I certainly hope so . We have a , a classic ranch , up in Denton . Ranch style home , I shou , I would hate to think that anybody thought , uh , the lot we live on as a ranch . Uh , it 's in a subdivision and one story . It started out life as a three bedroom house , and now has no two car garage and has , uh , the two extra rooms enclosed . 

I suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of enclosing the garage . Are most of the houses in your area three bedroom , two bath ? 

Almost a hundred percent . I , I ca n't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision . Ours is probably the closest to it . You know how realtors are , they 'll say , oh this could be five bedrooms . Yeah , if you had two people that do n't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house , Yeah , to . do n't need a closet . The only thing about mine , um , I think there 's probably about , oh , when I go down the street I can just pick out houses that are , that are identical to mine and usually they are the four bedroom , um , but they 're spaced out , oh I 'd say maybe three , on a two block period . Because it 's all different builders up here . So it 's kind of hard at that point to , you know , classify some of the builders . But most of the builders all built three , two . But the one thing , my house is a little bit different and I can pick it out again because it 's not typical , is I 've got the , oh , what do you call a , uh , double ceiling , double high in one half of the house . So like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings . Uh , cathedral ceilings . And , uh , the kitchen is norm and the bedrooms are norm . So it just goes down the dining room , the family room , and the living room that way . And I love the space . It just , it 's , uh , 

luckily I came from a house in Colorado which had the cathedral ceiling and I just lucked out and walked into this one and of course I felt the same airy feeling , which I liked it real well , so it 's a nice thing to move into , but , again , it 's not typical in this area . You can just spot them because the ce- , the roof is so hi , much higher . But , uh , Well I had n't thought about it in that sense , of the high roofs . We have cathedral ceilings in , uh , two rooms . In the , uh , family room and in the master bedroom and those are , are pleasant . Yeah . 

Well it 's like when my son goes up into the , up into the furnace area over the garage . Yeah . He can walk and he 's six foot . And he says , oh , come on up mom . I 'm not going up there . I 'm not going up there , but he says there 's plenty of room up there for a room . So that means if I knock out the wall in my family room , I could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem . But , um , I 'm not that ambitious . I tol- , maybe someday when I feel really ambitious and an- , get angry I 'll start poking holes up there , but until that time . But , uh , I 've noticed the houses around here are basically , it 's one story and they 're all basically two , uh , bath , two , uh , with three bedrooms . And we 're ninety , I would say about , oh , about ninety-five percent , no I guess may- , probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick , uh , with some wood . Right . But it 's , it 's basically all brick . The next subdivision over from me is total brick and the one on the other side of me is about the same as mine . But , uh , the one on opposite the street now , they 're total brick and they 're basically almost all three , two . They 're all three , two . But of course they have a little river going down their area too , which is kind of nice . If it 's the kind of river I 'm thinking of , better them , than , than us , you know . 

Are you talking about a , a real river , creek ? No it 's a creek , they 've put little fountains in and such . Well that 's nice . Uh , I came from Mississippi recently 

and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the rains and they did n't pay any , any attention to banks and that kind of stuff . Oh . So you 're just as likely to fl- , wake up and discover you 're in two inches of water . Do you have a lot of property , I mean a lot of yard around your house now , in Denton ? Uh , it 's a third of an acre . I do n't think that 's a lot , uh , in fact , I have been real disappointed in the six years that I 've lived out here about lot sizes . I 'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have . Yeah , when you get down closer in to the newer tract homes you find almost like there 's no lot line at all . They 're built practically on top of each other . 

That 's true . I know , I was , An , and while , while there are some advantages to that , there 's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things . Uh , I just feel hemmed in by that . It 's not as comfortable a living for me . Uh-huh . Well this subdivision here has got , 

oh , there 's enough to put , oh , I 'd say , uh , what , twelve feet between each house on each side . Well , I 've got more on one side than I 've got on the other , but I 'm like you , I came down from Colorado and there was more land up there around a yard with a big full back yard , which here , I look out my back yard and I can see the gate . I mean the fence is right there , I mean just do n't run too fast , or you 'll hit it and I 'm not used to that either . I mean I could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me , but to me , you put the swimming pool in your back yard and you 've lost your back yard . Entirely . I mean , uh , sure , I mean you 've got a little place on one side or the other , but , uh , to me they 're not that big enough for a pool , but , you know , they 're going up , so . But it 's , uh , it 's great for mowing . Fro- , from that aspect , you 're right . 

And , and it does n't take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff . But yes , I 'm used to , uh , walking out the back yard and you can play catch across the back yard and you 've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball , but , do n't do it around here . No , the one , that 's sort of what drove me to Denton , when I first came out here in eighty-five . I started looking and it seemed like the further I got away from Dallas , center , uh , the more lot came with the house and , and the lower the price , at the same time . And it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city . 

I had n't thought about it that way . S- , so moving up thirty-five , I stopped when I got to Denton . Uh . It ju- , well see now , with our jobs mainly hitting downtown Dallas we could n't go too much further , but , we pra- , we went that way . It was the schools and the cost of houses , so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic , time to get into work , and that 's where we stopped . It was the tham- , same problem . But I think Plano 's , 

You all both , you all both work downtown ? I got layed off by T I . Oh , well , this is a wonderful thing that , that you 're doing here still helping them out . Oh , I ye- , Uh , but you were working downtown . No , I was working at the Dallas site . My ex-husband was working downtown . Oh . 

But I have , uh , no , T I as far as I concerned , they 've been great as far as layoffs is concerned , so I have no problems . But as far as the housing , I would like , personally , I would like to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller . But prices in Plano , there is n't , um , there is n't a section in Plano you can really move to without getting caught and , uh , it , my price right now , for what I pay ,
