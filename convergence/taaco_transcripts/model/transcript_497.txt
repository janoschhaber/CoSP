How do you feel about the Viet Nam war ? Huh , well , um , you know , I guess it 's pretty deep feelings , uh , I just , uh , went back and rented , uh , the movie , what is it , GOOD MORNING VIET NAM -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh . Yeah , 

I saw that as well . Got that , uh , uh , some insight there , to , to kind of help me put together the feelings . I really appreciated the , the whole , uh , English class where the , uh , the , uh , fellow just would n't do it , you know , the guy 's gouging , gouging your eyes out , what are you going to do ? Uh-huh . You know , what for him to finish me off . And , uh , it , it was , uh , good to remember the , uh , that , that kind of Asian philosophy -- Uh-huh . Well , were -- 

-- that , uh . -- you ever in Viet Nam or , No , no , I was kind of an in-between , uh , finally drew a high draft number , and you ? Um , I was much too young , I was born in sixty-seven , so . Oh . Um , you know , both my , well , both my brothers were , um , draft age , but neither of them wound up going over , which , I think they were very happy for . Well , I , personally , uh , you know , uh , I just went in limbo . I had a passport and was ready to go -- Uh-huh . -- or um , out of the country or -- Yeah . -- join special forces , either one . Uh-huh . I mean , I just did n't know . So , uh . Well , um , so well do you , do you feel that it was worth what we did over there ? Um , yeah , just a second . Okay . Okay . Sure , now . Well , Mark , um , what was that again ? Um , do you think , I mean , do you think , our invest- , the investment in lives and money was worth it ? No , not , not really . I totally agree with that . Um . Um . What , what effects do you think it 's had on our country ? Downside . Um , uh , well , 

the MUMBLEx says we should , uh , go into the grief that , that 's there and , you know , MUMBLEx presidents have always avoided that -- Uh-huh . -- as a country . So it 's pretty serious , really , you know , lot of things that are n't being addressed . Uh-huh . 

I think MUMBLEx you know , that 's pretty typical that , of the entire , entire involvement over that , you know , that nothing was really addressed , it was , it was n't , you know , it was never we , we announced that we were going to war , it was such a gradual and subtle , you know -- Yeah . -- thi- , um , you know increasement of , of force that . 

Gulf of Tonkin , uh , resolution and was it a dolphin or a torpedo . You remember that ? I vaguely remember we , um , we had a , we had a , um , spy ship torpedoed or something . Yeah , yeah , only only it was foggy and finally President Johnson said , well , they 're were n't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo . Oh . Is n't that something ? Uh-huh . Um , so , um , do , do , do you think that like , uh , um , for example like in , in this past war , in the Persian Gulf war -- Uh-huh . -- that , uh , that you see , it seemed to me that , that Bush was going , going to extraordinary lengths to , um , you know , prepare the country for war . 

Hey Mark -- Yeah . -- I 've got to go , um . Okay . We 'll see you . I guess our five minutes are up according to me . Are they to you ? 

Uh , I was n't really keeping count . But I guess , good-bye . Yeah , okay , bye-bye . Bye .
