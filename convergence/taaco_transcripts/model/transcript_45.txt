Okay . So , who 's your , uh , favorite team ? Who do you think ? The Dallas Cowboys . The Dallas Cowgirls , huh . Yeah . Well , they did have a fairly decent year finally this year . Uh-huh . At least they 're coming around . Yeah , 

they 're going to get better . I mean , you know . Well I mean , you know , I think , uh , once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established , uh , they 'll do all right . Yeah . As long as Troy Ot- , Aikman does n't get hurt again . That kind of killed them at the end of the season last year . Uh-huh . 

So , I do n't , I do n't even know who your favorite team is , actually . I 'm a Viking fan . Okay . I think I did know that , I just forgot . Okay . And they have n't been doing too hot , so . Yeah . Has Herschel Walker done much for them ? No , 

in fact , in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal . Definitely . Well , he was a good player . I guess , well I do n't know , he just never , I do n't know , for a while there MUMBLEx , I 've never been over impressed with him . Well , he could always get past , you know , he 'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone . But , um , I guess you never could really see him play , because with the Cowboys , while he was with the team , the rest of the team was pretty poor so you could n't really tell if it was just him or the team and I always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team . But , I do n't know . Well , who 's the running , is it Sammy Smith , or is it , Emmett Smith . 

Emmett Smith , yeah . Emmett Smith . N- , he 's been doing real good . I 'm -- Yeah . -- pretty impressed with him so far . Did he , did he actually play in the Pro Bowl . I remember he was like a backup and then somebody got injured and he was supposed to go . I 'm not sure . Yeah , I kind of , I have n't been keeping up with football , I mean , in the fall I , I can go on and on about football , but since it 's kind of off season , it 's kind of hard to think back about all that . But , uh , , Who else is , uh , oh 

there 's , you know , Mike MUMBLEx , Minnesota Vikings , used to be the general manager starting the World Football League . Yeah . So , and th- , and he was trying to keep , uh , uh , I ca n't even think of the guy 's name , either , the coach of the Vikings . Um , I have no idea . Bu- , Jerry Burns . No earthly idea . Goin- , ke- , he was going to keep him as the coach somehow , but , uh , I do n't know , I 'd like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow . How did they end up this year ? Did they , did they make it to the play-offs at all ? Well , they started out really bad , they went like one and six , and then they won five or six in a row . Uh-huh . So they were in a shot to make the play-offs and they screwed up the last couple of games . Kind of like the cowboys , huh . Yeah , I guess you can , Except I think the Cowboys are on the upswing . I do n't know about the Vikings . Yeah . Just had n't heard much about them lately . And the Cardinals were kind of like the Cowb- , in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys , and the Cowboy , Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season , and the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys , so . Yeah . Well , the Cardinals , I do n't know . I think the Cowboys probably have a , a better team . They just , 

at the end of the season , the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt , because , uh , Laufenberg just could n't ever really get it together at all . Of course , he sat along the sidelines all season , he never really got in a game , never did a whole lot . Oh , do n't made any excuses for him . Well , I 'm just saying I should n't , I should n't blast him like that , say , oh well , Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them , I mean , he did n't get to see much action . But , too bad . Because now , now , you know , he had a shot and , and did n't look too good and so , no one 's going to have much faith in him any more . Uh-huh . In fact , I think they 're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback . I have n't , uh , I have n't kept up with it lately , but I remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on , or , or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody , 

but it was n't anybody I 'd really heard of . But I heard on the radio this morning , or yesterday morning , that , uh , Aikman 's back in practicing , doing real , real well . Um , who is it , Michael Irvin -- Uh-huh . -- MUMBLEx he said that , uh , Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time . So , sounds like he 's going to be all right for next season . They 're just trying not to overwork him right now , until he gets his shoulder , uh , back in shap- , it was his shoulder , was n't it , that he had the problems with ? 

I do n't know . Yeah I think it was . I think it , I think it was his shoulder he had surgery on . 

But anyway , they 're trying to keep him , you know , keep him , uh , from reinjuring anything , but anyway . But , uh , well I got my thirty day notice yesterday . Thirty day notice for what ? Um , I 'm done , where I work . Oh , really . So , anyway , I guess we ca n't talk much more about that , but I just thought I 'd throw that in there . What . Oh , okay , maybe I 'll call you back after , after the recording is finished . Actually I think we have talked about football for five minutes . I ca n't remember . 

Oh , w- , I 've always ran out of time ever since I 've done this . Really . I usually have , too . They always say you 've talked your ten minute limit . Yeah , I 've done that once or twice . I did n't look at the clock when we started talking , 

so I guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in . Make sure we get our cash flow . Yeah . So other than the Vikings , who do you like ? 

Um , actually , when I was younger , I was a Cardinal fan , too . Uh , oh . Remember Jim Hart ? Jim Hart was playing . Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals . This was a long time ago . Yeah . Um , I do n't know who else I 've ever . That 's about it , I was always a Viking fan . I think I was into the Cardinals for a little bit and , Uh-huh . Back when they were in Saint Louis ? Yes , oh , of course . Since they 've been to Phoenix they have n't been , uh , all that impressive , I guess . I guess I 've always been a Cowboy fan . Other than that , I mean , you know , when I 've , you know , when you grow up in a city that has the , you know , one of the greatest football teams until the last few years , you kind of tend to get caught up in it . Yeah , well , the Cowboys were th- , America 's football team , Yeah . there 's no question about that , so . Yeah , I mean it , it was really exciting , growing up when , when the Cowboys were really big . Because my parents would always have season tickets , and they 'd go to all the games , and you know , the hype were just unbelievable . It 's just , you know , the last , oh I guess probably since about eighty-four , about eighty-five was when they started kind of going downhill really , but , you know , I 'm just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys , Cowboys , Cowboys , and , you know , Super Bowl , and all this other stuff . So , I ca n't , you know , I 'm not going to decide I do n't like them just because they 're having a few bad years . I mean , I think they 'll pull out of it , and , you know , they 'll , they 'll wind up being good again . They 've got some , lot of really good young players that are going to , that are going to , uh , do pretty good , I think . But , they 're raising prices on their tickets . So they 're banking on doing good next season . I think tickets are , Again . Yeah . What are they going up to , thirty bucks or something ? Thirty , or thirty-two for really good tickets . 

See , they , they sectioned it out even more . They used to just have like , uh , first of all it was all one price . And then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else . And now they 're sectioning it off to like from the , from one twenty yard line to the other one , just on the lower levels is the highest price , and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level , and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line . And then they 're some sections kind of in the corner areas , and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end , the direct end zones . But , um , they have about four or five different prices now , that they 're structuring it with , but obviously yeah , they 're all going up , MUMBLEx more or less is what it 's going to do . So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year . 

Um , you know , I 'm not sure , I 'm not positive , I did n't , I did n't really think about that . I just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper . But , not that I 'll ever go . I had n't been to a Cowboys game , las , time , last time I went to the Cowboys game was during that , um , N F L strike , or the , when they had the scab team , teams in there , and it was the , uh , Dallas and Washington Redskins game . And I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets , because a lot of those doctors have season tickets , and they , um , if they 're not going to use them they 'll give them to somebody else . So my dad , I went with my dad to a game that one time . But that was n't a real , you know , it was , it was the scab teams , it was kind of , you know , it was kind of different , I guess . And before that it 's been quite a few years . I 've been wanting to go to a game , I just never , never have gotten around to it . So maybe this year MUMBLEx . 

That 's interesting , I almost lost our electricity here . Oh .
