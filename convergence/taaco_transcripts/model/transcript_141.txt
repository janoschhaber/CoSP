Perhaps this connection , no , it still echoes . Okay , um , Do you like to cook ? I love it . I do too . Uh , It , it 's kind of hard to find time sometimes but , Do you work ? Yes . And have a family ? Uh , I do n't have a family , but I , I usually work about fifty hours a week and , Oh ! by the time I get home I 'm so tired it 's hard to cook a full meal . I expect so . Uh , well for a dinner party , I think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine . That 's , that 's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party , mine is , is a , is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce , Oh . 

so . Where did you get your recipe for it ? Um , I guess mostly out of an international cookbook that I have . Oh , okay . Well mine actually came from the , um , Texas Instruments Cafeteria . Oh . They , they , They have a T I plant in Texas , in Kingsport ? Yeah , we have , it 's in Johnson City . Oh , uh-huh . And , um , the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes , you know , like once a month , 

they 'll put out a recipe of the month . Uh-huh , great . And they , they put this one out and I tried it and it was really good . What is , uh , is a marsala wine a sweeter wine ? Yeah , 

a little bit sweeter . Uh-huh . And it , uh , it 's a , it 's a red wine . Okay . And , uh , I 'm trying to think what else . I , I roll it in bread crumbs and , uh , Parmesan cheese , Uh-huh . and , then I rub it with a little bit , I rub the chicken with a little bit of oil , Huh . and pour the wine sauce over it as , like the last twenty minutes , Oh . so that it gets just enough flavor . Oh , so it kind of browns and then you put wine over it . Right . Uh-huh . That sounds real good . 

And , it 's really easy too so , Yeah . What do you use MUMBLEx ? What do you serve with it ? Huh ? What do you serve with it ? 

I like to serve , um , a wild rice with it . Uh-huh . That 's what I do too . This is really neat . And , I , we 're big broccoli fans . Uh-huh that 's what I 've got . I 've got steamed broccoli down on mine . 

Well , I just , I just do n't think you can go wrong with something like that . No , it 's great . I 've got a good dessert recipe . Oh , what ? Uh , do you like angel food cake ? Yes . I just break it up in a glass bowl , Uh-huh . and then I mix up , uh , some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta wi- , and some cool whip , Wow . and I make a thickened blueberry sauce and I layer it with , uh , angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping . What time should we be there ? . That sounds wonderful . 

It is , it 's great . I love desserts , but since there 's only two of us , Uh-huh . it 's really , I , I try to avoid making anything that , too fancy , that , Right . we 'd like too much and eat too much . I know , I know what you mean . We do n't eat desserts much any more . But I , I guess one that , that I really like , that I have n't made in awhile , and it 's , it 's called a fruit pizza . Uh-huh . And you take a , uh , sugar cookie , uh , recipe , Uh-huh . and , and spread it out on a pizza pan . So you make it like a pizza crust , 

and then you , you bake that and then you , um , take things like kiwi , Uh-huh . and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want and you mix that with , um , excuse me , you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice and I ca n't remember what else is in it and you make kind of a glaze , Uh-huh . and then you layer your fresh fruit on that . Oh , and pour that over it ? Yeah . That sounds great . It is really good , and it , It would be pretty . it 's real light and it , depending on the fruit you use it 's , you know , it 's real colorful . Right . Yeah . Especially with like the kiwi and the strawberries . Right . That would be pretty . So , but usually I just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream . We 've been fixing something lately that , well we 've been cooking a lot of , turkey breasts . Uh-huh . Because it 's low fat . Yeah , 

it 's just so much better for you . And I 've been making a hot sandwich . I toast a piece of whole wheat bread , Uh-huh . and then put the turkey on it and then slices of the low fat Swiss cheese and then I make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it , Oh ! and pop it in the microwave . That sounds great . It is delicious . 

I would n't mind serving that to anybody . No , and that 's some- , that 's something that just , you know , it does n't take a long time to fix , No . it 's really good , and it 's really good for you . Yeah , it 's real quick . And we eat out a lot and there are sometimes you just do n't feel like eating out , Right . and I wish I had something a little bit different , Uh-huh . to just zap together . Yeah . Well ma- , mix up a little , uh , mayonnaise with some dijon mustard , Uh-huh . and honey until it just , I mix it until it just tastes good to me . I was going to say , do you just mix it to taste ? Uh-huh . Okay . Yeah , and it 's real good . And it keeps in the refrigerator . 

How long , does it keep , do you , well you would n't have to make , Oh , it keeps a long time . Yeah , and you would n't have to mix that much together even . No , uh-huh , 

it keeps a long time . I 'm sorry I keep coughing . I 've had a bad cold . Oh . And I put a little , um , oh , yogurt in it too . Plain ? Plain yogurt ? If I , just plain yogurt . It gives it a little tang . I 'll bet that is really good . It makes a great sandwich . Man , I 'm going to have to think of that . We 're getting company tonight , Oh , are you . and I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian . Oh , yeah , that 's kind of hard . So , we 're going to , I think we 'll try to do something a little bit , we might try to , to , um , to grill some flounder or salmon steaks . They 'll eat fish ? Yeah . She 'll eat fish . And , I usually , when they come down I 'll grill those -- Uh-huh . -- and brush on a little lemon butter sauce and , um , definitely go with , it will have to be a rice dish -- Right , uh-huh , that sounds good . -- lots of vegetables , to make up for the lack of meat . Right . I had a recipe from that , um , INTERNATIONAL COOKBOOK TWO , that 's a great salad in summertime . Do you , do you garden or not ? No we do n't , our next door neighbors do and some , a lot of times they 'll give us something . Okay . MUMBLEx it 's just sliced tomatoes 

and I put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty . Yeah . Sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips , Oh ! just over it , Uh-huh . and some red onion slices , Uh-huh . and just a little bit of , um , basil , Okay . and then a little Italian dressing over it . And everybody loves it and it 's so easy , and it 's delicious . 

That 's what I was just thinking , it does n't sound like it , it would be hard at all . Huh-uh , it is n't . 

where did you get , And you can put some cucumber slices on too . where did you get this cook book ? I got it at the Checkbook Store . Really ! And , it 's got beaut , all these beautiful pictures , in there that are inspiring . It 's going to say , uh , edited by Charlotte Turgeon , editor of , I 'm not french , LaRoute , Gastro LaMink 

the creative cooking course . I 'll might have to visit the State Book Store . I 'm trying to see who it 's published by , Ottenheimer , 

I 've never heard of it . I have n't either . This edition is published by Bonanza Books . Okay . It 's a big book but it was not expensive . Well , the ones that I 've been , I 've been wanting to get , um , I guess you 've seen the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK CHICKEN , Uh-huh . and the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK PASTA , Uh-huh . I 've been , I 've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken , and we do eat a lot of pasta . Yeah . 

So , we , we just said the other night it would n't be too difficult to be , to do without red meat . That 's right . I do n't think it would . You know , we do n't have that much of it now . 

As long as we have plenty of vegetables , Uh-huh . and lots of chicken . I stir fried some the other night though . Some , uh , beef and broccoli strips , it was good , but it did n't have much beef in it . Yeah , I 've got a , I 've got a Wok that we do n't use near as often as we used to . Uh-huh . 

We used to stir fry a lot , especially , um , a lot of chicken and , and a lot of rice dishes . Uh-huh , it just takes the time to cut everything up . Yeah . But usually if I 'm , if I 'm , if I take a day off or on the weekend especially , I try to cook , Cook . real , real food . Uh-huh . And at least cook a couple of dishes ahead . Right . 

So that we can have those to enjoy . Uh-huh . So , One of my daughters sent me a COLORADO COOK BOOK , put out by the Junior League of Denver . Uh-huh . Have you ever seen any put out by Junior Leagues ? Yes . Cause , we have some , they are great . some local ones . Uh-huh . And we have a share alike column in the paper , Uh-huh . where people , you know , write in and share recipes or write in and say I 'm looking for this recipe , Uh-huh . Right . and that 's where I get a lot of my recipes . Yeah . They are good , usually good are n't they ? Yes . 

And I got , I got a real good one from a doctor 's office one time . Oh , is that right , what was that ? . It 's , uh , it 's a baked bean recipe . Uh-huh . 

And , you mix baked beans and Lima beans and , uh , let 's see , I guess , You buy the canned baked , canned baked beans ? Yeah . 

Just mix the canned beans together , Uh-huh . and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup , you know , Uh-huh . and , and you just bake it . And it 's just , it 's like a , a spicier baked bean dish . Oh , that sounds . And , you can add hamburger if you want , Uh-huh . to give it a little more body . That sounds good . So , I , I try to always keep my eyes open and because a lot of time you can find , find really good recipes where you would n't even think about it . Right . So , I try to always keep a little notebook in my purse . Uh-huh . Jot them down , huh ? But , it 's been ,
