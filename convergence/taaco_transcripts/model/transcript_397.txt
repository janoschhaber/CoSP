Okay . So what do you , uh , think is the , uh , the worst culprit for air pollution ? Well , I think it 's , it 's probably a combination of things . 

Um , factories that , that burn coal as a , an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants , you know , and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides . Uh-huh . Uh , those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain , and I think that 's , that 's probably hurting us a little bit . It 's hurting , you know , it 's hurting Germany , for example , too , and some other parts of Europe where they , where they have high industry . So we 're not the lone ranger here . Yeah . I , uh , I , it 's hard to put the finger on , uh , what 's worse , you know , the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion , um , with , uh , your hydrocarbons , uh -- Yeah . -- causing the damage in which , Hopefully we 're backing off from that a little bit , but I know we have n't cured it yet by a long shot . 

Well , I notice on one of these , uh , home shopping networks they were selling these , uh , halogen , uh , fire extinguishers -- Yeah . -- and the halogen is , uh , an ozone depleter , and it got hydrocarbons in there . It 's a very clean , uh , fire extinguisher , but it 's , you know , really bad on the environment . Yeah . Huh . Yeah , I guess I missed that one . Uh . Yeah . Automobiles of course are contributing , too , and , you know , how , how we are with our love affair with the auto -- Yeah . -- kind of hard to do anything about that , I guess . I know , uh , in the Twin Cities area , I just moved out of there and was kind of happy I timed it just right , 

but they had a new policy where in order to get your , uh , your license , uh , your car license , uh , renewed , you had to meet the pollution standards -- Yeah . -- and , uh . We have that here , too , but it 's part of the inspection sticker , you know , they put a probe in your exhaust pipe and , and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out , and -- Yeah . -- so that 's , you know , that 's the way they 're dealing with it here . Yeah , uh , yeah 

I guess that was just mainly in the cities there , and as far as where I live , I do n't have to do that , but -- Yeah . -- I have an old car which I doubt would , uh , would , uh , pass the inspection , a seventy-six , and , uh , you know , there 's no way I would put in a lot of money to , to repair it -- Yeah . -- to meet standards . It 'd probably be difficult anyway . Yeah . So , although I do what I can to , to cut down pollution , 

but , uh . I was just reading an article in , uh , MOTHER EARTH NEWS , MOTHER EARTH NEWS magazine -- Yeah . -- and , uh , they 've got a new , uh , you know a lot of places are burning wood -- Yeah . -- a lot , a lot of people are burning wood , those of us who have , I 've got a place in the country , you know -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , they 've had catalytic con , you know , catalytic converters on those , on , uh , I think they 're required in California and Oregon and , and Washington , but they 've had up those for quite a while , and somebody 's come up with a new one that , uh , sort of , it 's a , it 's a catalytic converter , it 's , it 's a plate that fits in , you know , into the smoke pipe -- Yeah . -- and , uh , apparently it sort of feeds itself . The more smoke is produced , you know , after you get to like five hundred degrees , the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is . And it sounds real neat . I have n't seen them priced anywhere yet , but that , that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on -- Yeah . -- you know , old , old , uh , older stoves that do n't have any kind of E P A requirements on them . That might help a little bit , especially in some places . We 're really lucky here . We have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out . Yeah . Now sometimes we get a kind of a , especially in , in , uh , autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us , but most of the time it 's blowing out pretty well . Yeah . Probably blowing up there to you guys . Yeah , well , well around here I , we get , uh , well it depends , you know , either in the , in the winter time it , it blows it your way , and in the -- Yeah . -- summer time -- It comes back . -- we probably get yours . Yeah . I really think , uh , you know , we 're doing some , some important things . Education , raising consciousness awareness , uh , I know school kids , I work for the school district here , and , uh , you know , this is one of the big things with kids . Kids are writing letters to the newspapers about , you know , telling adults to -- Yeah . -- clean up their act and , it 's uh , you know , I hope we 're not too late with it . We 're , we 're , uh , we 're having all kinds of recycling . Yeah , well , it , uh , th- , that 's a big thing , too . 

I know it has nothing to do with air pollution , but I kind of look at the way people treat our ,
