What kind of painting are you planning to do ? Well I have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting . Uh-huh . And , um , it 's a rent house and I decided it 's too expensive to rewallpaper so I decided I 'm going to paint . Uh-huh . And I 've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint . And I 'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them . Oh , what would be interesting . Either that or maybe rag rolling . Uh-huh . To give it kind of a country look . Yeah , I 've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments , but they look very interesting and you get some beautiful effects with them . Yeah . Uh , one of the books that I bought , where it 's d , describing the sponge painting , said you can like layer different colors and , Yes , yeah , I 've seen that done , where there 's uh , oh , 

I saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat and then it had , a little bit darker sort of peachy color , Uh-huh . and in between there was a sort of a rust , uh , put on very sparingly . Ugh . And it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco . Yeah . Um , what I , what I 'm trying to do is I 've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms -- Uh-huh . -- so I want something that 's going to tie that together and I 'm changing the , like the towel racks and stuff , the , the fixtures out to make them wood , I 'm going to put wood in there . Oh , yeah , that should be nice . So it 's going to have kind of a country look . Uh-huh . Um , and I have n't even decided as far as , um , what kind of paint to buy . 

I do n't have an actual instruction book so I 'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now . Well , uh . Um , it 's going to be a big experiment . Yeah , 

I was about to say , you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing . Yeah . Because you might find that it 's beyond , uh , what you 're willing to put into it . Yeah , yeah . Although I think it could turn out really nice . Yeah , I 've , I have n't ever done fancy painting but I sure did my share of just regular painting . Uh , I 've painted several houses , inside . No- , I , Uh-huh , inside . never painted the outside . What , what kind of , what kind of paint do you normally use ? Well , uh , we used a latex , uh , wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork and my job was mostly the woodwork . Okay , uh-huh . My husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers and I got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine , uh , trim work , Uh-huh . where I 'd use a small brush and , uh , try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that . Uh-huh . Well we only have on- , only one of our bathroom has a window in it so I 'm hoping that , um , it wo n't be too much of a , a problem . Uh-huh . Um , I 'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first . Because I , I think , Well I was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it . No , I 'm , I 'm planning on taking it off . I have heard that they 've got these steamers you can rent now , which make it much easier to get wallpaper off . Um . Um , I tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago , oh , with a just a scraper and wet sponge and it took forever . I would not recommend that method . Okay . Uh , if -- Well that 's something that , that 's worthwhile checking into then . 'Cause I , -- if you can rent a steamer , if it 's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble . If it 's really old , you do n't know what it 's put on with . It , it 's hard to tell , it 's , the patterns look like they 're nineteen sixties style . Yeah . And I know the house , um , was built around the mid fifties . Uh-huh . So it may be the original wallpaper . Could be , yeah . Um , if it 's vinyl it should be easier to strip too . If it 's paper it will probably shred . Um , in one bathroom it 's , um , it 's probably paper , uh , it 's silver , silver and yellow , Um , uh-huh . and white . Well the wallpaper that I was trying to remove was black , i- , this was in a bathroom too . And the , the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white and the , the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background and then it had vivid , uh , almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise , and lime green and silver , and , uh , a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that . Um , that 's kind of an odd color for a bathroom . Oh it was awful , it was absolutely hideous and , and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it and a , a guest went in there and he said it 's a good thing I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something to drink and went in there I would think I was having hallucinations . Really . Well I , I 've also been thinking about , after looking at all these magazines , um , these design magazines and stuff , I 'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too , in a color that will kind of , um , tie in our , um , our , um , our , uh , comforter , Uh-huh . with a color that 's kind of a , um , burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design . Uh-huh . Um , and I 'm not really quite sure , I do n't know if maybe I 'm biting off more than I can chew . Well I 'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale . Yeah , well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting . Sure . It would n't be any kind of special , um , special effects type thing . Yeah . It would be just plain paint . Well it 's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time . Because if you , uh , use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out , uh , all the parts that you do n't want to slop over onto , you do n't have to be quite as precise about how you do it and it can be done a whole lot faster . Um , okay . And with rollers and , uh , modern latex paints , you can wash up easily because they 're water soluble . Uh-huh . And they dry fast so you really do n't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend . If you have some help . Um . And then if that , if you discover the little tricks and tips about , you know , how you get through corners and how you do trim and , uh , how long to leave the masking tape down , because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when it , when you pull it up . It , it peels the paint off when you take it off , yeah . Well , not , i- , if you leave it on for weeks , it will do that . If you take it up the next day it should be fine . You want it to get dry , but not , uh , just real hard . Yeah , okay . You do n't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried to hard . That 's the problem . Yeah . It will come up a lot easier if you do n't wait too long . And I 've , I was told , I always used the nice wide masking tape , but I 've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth . Oh really , okay . Because it , it rips as you pull it off for one thing and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape . Um . And the whole point of using it is to save yourself work . You can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape . But use , use good , uh , stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands , Okay . that will go down and come up easily . Well I really appreciate all the helpful tips , I think you are , just made my project a lot easier . Well I wish you very good luck with it and I will tell you that I have retired from the painting business . The last time I had something done was my kitchen cabinets and I decided that was too much to tackle , I 'd hire a professional . If you were , if you were closer I 'd , I 'd , I 'd tell you you could come over and supervise . Well if I were closer I might . Oh , well I hope your project turns out great and I , really think that it 's exciting that you 're going to try the sponge painting . I think that could give it a really a , Well , we 'll see how it goes , I may just be flat painting over it . Well , of course that 's the other advantage of paint . If you do n't like it all you do is put on another coat . Yeah . I guess we 'd better go because our time looks like it 's about up . Yeah , I , I need to go to the dentist , so . Okay , bye-bye . It 's was nice talking to you Kathleen . Thank you . Bye-bye .
