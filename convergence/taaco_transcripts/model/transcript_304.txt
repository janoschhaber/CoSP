You ready ? Yeah . Okay . What have you seen lately ? Well , uh , it 's funny , when I tried , 

to make the call the other days , I thought , I had n't seen anything since DANCES WITH WOLVES but today I went to see REGARDING WITH HENRY . Oh , I 'm dying to see that . 

It was really good . We -- Oh . -- uh , Jeff Wariner just got out of the hospital -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , Jeff and Deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood , and , uh , we all liked it . We had both moms and , uh , fifteen year olds and a twelve year old and -- Oh , my goodness . -- everyone enjoyed it . And , uh , 

Oh , well I am just dying to see it . I went to dinner with some friends last weekend and they said get a baby-sitter and we 'll all go see REGARDING HENRY -- Yeah . -- and I said , ooh , I want to see it so bad . Well , my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer , on , choir tour and -- Oh . -- visiting friends and one thing and another . A lot of the ones I had wanted to see and so since he had this friend up from Houston , uh , and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I thought well , I want to see this one , too . 

So , we , uh , Yeah . I finally , it 's my first summer movie . Oh my . Well , let me see . Was it , 

well , we went to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS last weekend and that may be , no , right before I went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on , we 're going to the movies . And we wo n't , well she goes all the time but I go maybe once every couple of months . Yeah . And when I go , I go see two at a time . So we went to see SOAPDISH , and -- Oh , was that good ? Cause , -- Oh , hysterical . We laughed so hard , 

it was just , you could n't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing -- Yeah . -- so hard . Well , I want to see that and CITY SLICKERS both . I love -- Yeah -- -- comedies . But , that 's what I was , 

-- that 's the other one that we went to that night . Oh , was it ? And , my face hurt so bad , from laughing -- Oh . -- because I love Billy Crystal . And course , growing up on , on the back of a horse , you know , and being on ranches and stuff , so much of that was so true and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles . It was so funny . Both of them were great . Oh , well good . 

I 'm , I 'm glad to hear that because they , Oh , they are , are we just laughed so hard . And like I said , with CITY SLICK- , I mean with SOAPDISH , it is so cornball and it is so overacted that you 're just hysterical -- Uh-huh . -- you know . Just , they just carried it off , to the tee . Well , I do n't , I do n't know if you got to see WEEKEND , um , AT BERNIE 'S -- No . -- that was out a couple of years ago . They had a free showing at the Berkeley , um , United Artist . How neat . And , I do n't know who was here or whether Jay called a friend and we did n't think we 'd have much chance of getting in but we thought we 'd try it , you know , free movie . Shoot , yeah . It was so funny and it sounds like , uh , what you were just describing , SOAPDISH , too . I mean , we just , we hurt by the time we came out . Oh yeah . And the whole theater was hysterical and it 's just , it 's just goofy . I mean , it 's , uh , if you have a chance to rent it , at least , or it should be out on T V , I would think , Yeah , I think it is . I think it is . Um , cause it 's , it 's just a fun summer light comedy , make your cheeks hurt laughing . Especially in the theater it was contagious , you know -- Yeah . -- I , I imagine the way SOAPDISH was , but , with -- Oh gosh -- -- everyone laughing . -- I never laughed . And people were just screaming and applauding and , you know , it was just hysterical . Well , I 'm glad you did that before your surgery . Oh , me too , because I do n't even know if I could live through it now . Yeah . I mean I 'm getting around real good and I 'm just still real sore . Yeah . And today I was , I , course I went back to work two weeks after , uh -- Oh , gosh . -- but see I do n't have permanent work . I , right now I 'm working with a temporary agency . 

And so , the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free . Oh . Oh , so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that 's what everybody wants , and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed . Yeah . And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day . And I said , yeah , and I went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that . And , uh , I worked about three days a week ever since , two to three days a week . And so I went to my doctors last Thursday , and this was my fourth week checkup and he said well gosh , you 're just healing really well , I just ca n't get over this . He says , in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things . If you want to play ball , you can go play ball . He says , now I 'm not going to say you 're going to feel like playing ball but you can -- Yeah . -- if you want to . And , uh , you know , he was teasing me and he says , yeah , you 'll be out there waterskiing , I can just see it now . And , uh , he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks . You 've only got two more weeks . I said okay fine , I , I will , I will . Whatever you call easy , I 'll do it , you know . But and I 've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it . Yeah . Yeah . And so , I do n't , I 'm real glad that we did n't go see those funny ones when I was , when I 'm still sort of on the sore side . Yeah . But , well , wha , what 's your next , have you seen ROBIN HOOD yet ? No , 

that was one , uh , Jay got to see with a friend and so I -- Uh . -- and to try and , uh , try and find time it 's hard , uh , with Jim 's schedule , too , just to get a time that we can both go . Oh yeah . And , uh , I 'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because , uh , we had friends that went to see that and said , you know , it 's just perfect for our age group -- Uh-huh . -- and because I think he , he needs a comedy , too . Uh , and that 's what he would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY , too , but knew that , uh , we 've , we 've got a lot of company this summer , which is wonderful . We 're really enjoying it but some of the different things we 're doing , uh -- Uh-huh . -- there 's just not a time , enough time to do it all and he said , well , realistically , Yeah . You know , he knew he could n't get them all in . But , uh , Jay really liked ROBIN HOOD . Um , when the choir group went to see BACKDRAFT and they thought that was , uh , it was funny cause he sounded like the critics . He said , you know the plot line and the characters , uh , you know are n't real big but the , the fire scenes and the dra- , you know -- Uh-huh . -- that action part is fantastic . But , he thought ROBIN HOOD was great . It was real different then you 'd expect , but h- -- Oh really ? -- but he enjoyed it 

and so , Well I went , course I am a Kevin Costner fan . Yeah , me too . And -- Supreme . -- yeah , I really , uh , like him a lot . Which is why , DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie we had seen -- Uh-huh . -- for several months but , Gosh , was that wonderful . It was , I , uh , in fact , uh , a friend from Germany was visiting in March and we wanted , we did n't , ran out of time , we wanted to take him to see it . We were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it , too . 

Oh , yeah . Uh , I just thought that was terrific . And I really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons I wanted to see , I do , too . I think he 's really good . And he 's very good in REGARDING HENRY . That 's not an easy part to play , I , I do n't think . I would n't think . Well , my kids are going to their Dad 's tomorrow night so I sort of think I may go do that . Yeah . That 's at , that one wo n't your sides . Good . 

Um , it , was this the first time you got to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS ? Or , I hav , my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie 's age . Uh-huh . And we went to the ,
