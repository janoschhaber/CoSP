Okay , well what movies do you like ? Gosh , I like just about anything . 

We , I think the last one we saw was , uh , TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PART TWO . Oh , now , I lo , I like the turtles . My little boy 's four and he loves them . 

Well , we do n't have any kids but we like them anyway . Oh , that 's okay . How old are you all ? Um , we 're late twenties . Oh , and you just do n't have any yet , okay . No . Well I 've got two . 

Oh , gosh . Yeah , my little girl is three months old and my little boy just turned four . I had his birthday party yesterday . Oh . But he 's a turtle fanatic . He even had turtle cake yesterday . But I 've been wanting to see TURTLE TWO . Is it as good as they say it is ? It was , 

it was actually better than the first one , I thought . Good . What 's the last movie you saw ? GHOST . Oh we were just , when , when the topic came up , we , I was asking my husband right quick , what 's the last movies we saw . He said well GHOST and TURTLES . I really liked it . Now GHOST , yeah , I love tearjerker movies . 

But that was n't too bad on tearjerker but , Not too awful bad . It was , oh , it was good movie , Yeah . Because that was just so good . And I like Demi Moore . Did you see PRETTY WOMAN ? No , but I 've been hearing a lot about it . I don- , we do n't get to the video store very often and we do n't have cable . Oh , gosh . Well we do n't really want cable , it 's just , you know , glued to the T V all the time anyway . Yeah . So we get two channels down here . 

MUMBLEx I 'm from Kentucky originally , Uh-huh . and we used to get five channels without cable . Yeah . You know , forty , well I do n't think you all have the same channels , but here in Texas we only get two channels , and that 's , um , do you watch soap operas ? Uh , once in a while , when I 'm home . Okay , you work then ? Yeah . Okay , well we get the channel with YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS on it . Okay . And then , uh , I think GENERAL HOSPITAL and that comes on different channel . Yeah , 

it does . But that 's all we get , and that 's no cartoons for my little boy . But we 've got a V C R and a lot of tapes . Yeah . And , uh , my husband is a movie fanatic . 

I think you would really like PRETTY WOMAN , it was , it was really a , it made you feel really good . It was just a happy movie . Oh , what about TOTAL RECALL , have you seen that . Yeah , I saw that one . That 's good . I , I was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was . Yeah , it was violent . I try to get away from that . My little boy , oh , he loves ROBO COP . 

And that movie , I have to , I 'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is , have you seen it ? Yeah . The part where they 're shooting mercy . 

I do n't like that . That , oh , that 's horrible , that is horrible and their , their , the language on that 's filthy . I do n't see why they have to do that , I mean , Yeah . I mean n- , everybody knows that it , that the , the language is there so they could just ignore it and , you know , Yeah . use different words instead , I think . Yeah , yeah , I know . But I , I think lately PRETTY WOMAN 'S been my favorite . I went and bought the video . I 've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times . 

Um , my husband bought me , like , um , uh , I think PRETTY IN PINK for my birthday . With , a , wait a second , I will in a minute Kyle , . Sorry . That 's okay . Uh , he bought me PRETTY IN PINK . 

Just a second . Sorry , now , you 're glad you ai n't got a four year old . That 's okay . Now , It this is the first time he 's interrupted my phone calls . Now I have n't seen PRETTY IN PINK , 

Molly Ringwald . Molly Ringwald ? Yeah . It was cute , but , it was n't , I like the , um , SIXTEEN CANDLES , or sixteenth birthday or , I think , I think SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it . Yeah , oh , that was so good . Of course I was a teenager when I seen that and I loved it . I have n't seen it either . Oh , well if you like love stories , it 's sweet . I do . Oh , it 's sweet , 

it really is . And that 's a tearjerker it gets you , I mean it makes you feel really sorry for her . Oh , gosh . But it 's hilarious too , especially with that , uh , little guy in it . Oh he looks like little , I do n't know , he looks like a little boy next door , Oh . but he 's sixteen . Oh , it 's a cute movie . I ca n't remember his name . He kind of looks like DOOGIE HOWSER . Huh , I do n't know . Do n't know either . Bu- , He 's got curly blonde hair , he just a little freckly , little boy . 

Probably know him if I saw him . Yeah , if I could remember the name , I know you 'd know his name , because he 's played in a few movies . But , uh , 

I was just thinking another good one I saw not too long ago was , um , SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY . Okay , I 've heard about that but I ca n't remember it . That , that 's , that 's Julia Roberts ' new movie . Okay , yeah , Julia Roberts is good . Yeah she 's , this one , you know PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and a romance , Uh-huh . and , and this one was a lot more dramatic . Was n't it a murder mystery ? Y- , well , Like , sort of . it was like , uh , it was a , it was a mystery . 

She disappeared from her hu- , uh , husband who was abusing her . Oh , okay , the , yeah , that 's the one I wanted to see where he was on , she was on a carnival , at a carnival on a Ferris wheel or something . Yeah , yeah . Well did that come on T V or did it come out in the , No , it came out in the theater . Oh . And I think , you know , around here , it 's all ready quit playing . But I do n't , I do n't know if it 's still playing any where else . Well I , I think , But it was , it was , Real good . it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat . 

I want to see that . Yeah , I seen the , uh , previews for it on T V down here , but it 's just been down here a couple weeks , I think . Oh , okay , Yeah . 

because we saw it , probably , A month a- , four or five months ago . Well I know it has n't been that long since I 've seen the previews for it , but yeah , I wanted to see it . Her husband was a , dark haired guy with a beard and moustache , or a- , no he shaved the beard off . Yeah , he 's , uh , he was a real psycho in the movie . Yeah . It was , it was scary . Oh , I 'd like to see that . What about , oh , there was a , we got one back here a while , I want to see WAR OF THE ROSES too , have you seen that ? Oh yeah , boy I , I did n't like it . 

You did n't ? No , it was , I did n't like the way it ended . I know , well the only reason I know why it ended is on ARSENIO HALL one night , Christopher Reeves told , Uh-huh . 

that , you know , I ca n't believe they killed them . Or , or who was it Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas . Might have been Michael Douglas . Oh , that starred in it . Yeah . Yeah , it was Michael Douglas . Christopher Reeve was n't in it at all ? Huh-uh . Okay . 

Well Arsenio Hall is the one that jumped up and said that I ca n't believe they killed them and Christopher Reeve , or , Mike Douglas went after his throat , you dummy . So I know that they die , but I have n't told my husband . We 've both been wanting to see it . It was , I , I , it was , it was weird . 

It was a different movie from anything I 've ever seen . MUMBLEx well we was , uh , teasing , about , you know , splitting our house down the middle . Yeah . They did that did n't they and they marked off routes that they could go or something . Yeah , that would be kind of hard for us , we 've only got one bathroom , I do n't know h- , , We 've got two bathrooms but , well i- , mi- , actually , if he takes , my house kind of looks like two trailers put together . And one bathroom is at the end of one side and one 's in the middle of the other , so we could do it . That would n't be too bad . No , and he could climb out the window . Wh- , and we , our whole house has , you know , every room leads to three rooms , so we can , you know -- Get around . -- yeah , you can get around . You just ca n't go out the front door honey , sorry . Well did you see FATAL ATTRACTION ? Yeah , that 's coming back , on too . I know it 's going to be on , on the , on C B S Tuesday night 

an , and that 's kind of what , in a way , you know , how it kind of bothered you , the way it ended and stuff . Uh-huh . That 's kind of how WAR OF THE ROSES was . Huh , I , Parts of , parts of WAR OF THE ROSES was funny but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious , and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling , you know . Eerie feeling , or , I want to see it though . I 'd like to see that and , uh , THE NEVER ENDING STORY , came out on Disney this month , I think . I -- I wanted to see that . -- I 've heard about that but I do n't know what it 's about . THE NEVER ENDING STORY ? Yeah . It 's a child 's movie , but , oh , it 's good , I enjoyed it . I love Disney movies . Yeah , I do too I mean , they 're some of the best of , that are made . Yeah , yeah . And , uh , well it 's about this little boy who , uh , 

I think he 's up in a attic , or some part of school . He got locked in the school and he got scared , but he starts dreaming and then , uh , he 's saving the land of , uh , oh , it 's been so long since I 've seen it . All I know , alls I can really remember is him flying this great big dog , this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing , Oh go- , it flies through the air . And he 's trying to save the land from some , ooze . But it 's really good , I mean it sounds ki- , it , it had , uh , Fred Savage in it . No , no , no , no , no . Did you see that movie with Fred Savage in it , though , I do n't think so . with , uh , oh , he had , uh , uh , oh it was THE PRINCESS BRIDE . Nope , I did n't see that . You did n't see that , that was cute , that was real , that was a good one . I , I like , I like slapstick comedy . So do I
