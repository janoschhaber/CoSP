So , uh , what things do you consider an invasion of privacy ? Ooh , well I do n't know . What do you think ? Oh , I do n't know . 

I had a little bit more time to think about it . I was thinking of , like , uh , I do n't know , I was ju- , started to think about all the big , you know , data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- and all those , you know , demographics studies that they do that , um , you know , have , who knows , how much , you know , stuff about all the purchases that you 've made and everything kept tract somewhere and I do n't know , I do n't know how much the stuff actually , what they actually have in there but -- Huh . -- I know they use that , I mean they sell those , Well what about , uh , required drug testing , uh , as a , uh , condition of employment ? Yeah , that was , that , that was the other one I was thinking of . I think that 's , uh , I mean I know drugs are illegal . It MUMBLEx thing actually . Uh , I , uh , have worked at Texas Instruments . Huh . Uh-huh . And , uh , they instituted a drug policy there . Drug testing policy where they randomly would test , uh , employees -- Uh-huh . -- and actually , to tell you the truth , I really did not think much about it . I , I had n't , you know , it really did n't relate to me . 

But there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they , they get a false positive , you know , what recourse do you have . Uh-huh . And , also , uh , uh , this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing , this kind of big brother activity and yet , uh , a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments , although they do n't admit to it , it 's actually , oh , a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure . Uh-huh . So what that means is , to me , that really it 's the government that 's requiring this , although they do n't actually e , execute it themselves , it 's really the government that MUMBLEx . So , in that sense , it , at least , philosophically , it 's really borderline legal . Uh-huh . 

Well I , I think the , I think that , you know , a person 's competence should be more determined by , you know , their actions and their behavior and if they 're , you know , if they 're on some kind of , you know , contol , controlled substance then , you know , it kinds of takes away from the job of , you know , the supervisor or manager type person , you know , who is able to evaluate them . I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a , you know , a chemical , you know , Well , what about this , uh , AIDS epidemic now ? Where you find that , uh , uh , you know , certain people are actually are , are criminal in their disregard for it- , -- These people that are carriers and do n't -- -- others . Yeah , and -- -- that do n't reveal it ? -- and , uh , of course , the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it does n't , 

it , uh , it destroys their libido . Yeah , tha- , that would be kind of an extreme . Now , uh , you know if they ever , I mean I 've heard of things like , you know , making them , you know , marking them somehow or , you know , or something like that or , you know , putting them all someplace like in a kind of , So what about that as an invasion of privacy ? Yeah . Wel- , I guess it kind of borders on where , I mean what do you value more . The invasion of , uh , the person 's privacy or the possible danger to , you know , other people . So really , it i- , gets to balancing , uh , personal freedom against , uh , the general welfare -- Yeah . -- of society . I guess that 's alwa- , that 's been the big role of government , I guess . I mean generally . Well , it , it 's supposed to have been . Yeah . Yeah . Well , that 's kind of a difficult one to go into . 

I mean that , that particular case . No , it , Because I mean , there 's a lot of people that , uh , I mean they could require , you know , ob , obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because I 'm , you know , there 's a huge part of the population , not a huge part but a , you know -- A growing part . -- the AIDS population I guess that have it , that do n't know they do -- Uh-huh . -- are spreading it . But , again , to require , you know , such a test and jus- , and then to make , make it MUMBLEx is to subject them to , to discrimi , discriminatory practices and other things . I do n't know , uh , I do n't know how exactly I feel about that . Maybe chop their weenies off .
