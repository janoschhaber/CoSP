We 're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis and , probably the first question would be whether you 've ever had to go through that process . Well , not so much personally but my , um , husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother , I mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such . They live down in College Station where ,  his parents do too . And they put her in a home last year . Uh-huh . She appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to , uh , not be able to be in her apartment on her own . Uh-huh . So they found a , a place nearby that they put her in last year . So it was pretty much a physical decision ? Uh , yeah , 

although she is , uh , in pretty good health and she 's , does n't take any medication , it 's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point . Um . Then she was starting to get , uh , you know , lose memory sometimes and , which is kind of frightening when she 's in the car . Yeah . Uh , 

My husband 's family are reaching that point but it 's , it 's so difficult . Was she in favor of it or , or was she kind of opposed to it ? Well , yeah , 

when it finally came down to it , um , she just got to the point after the , I mean , it was n't a very , um , strong stroke . It was just kind of all of a sudden she was n't herself anymore . Uh-huh . And she got kind of fearful of being on her own . She never really ate very well . It was one thing . She hardly -- Yeah . -- ever took care of herself and she did n't eat . She ate very poor so I think she was , you know , bad , uh , nutrition on top of it . And , uh , she got to the point she did n't want to alone anymore . So , So often I think though , elderly people do n't realize that their diet is that bad . 

I work with a lot of elderly people , I 'm a trust officer -- Um . -- and so often they think they 're adequately caring for themselves when they 're really not eating very much or very balanced meals . Well , she was almost ridiculous . Like she 'd eat ice cream and cookies . She 'd , Yes . Well you know that 's part of the aging process , Did n't one , That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste .  It really is . Oh really ? Yeah . Uh-huh . 

Well she did n't want to cook for herself anymore . Yeah . Oh , that 's too much trouble . That 's too much trouble . Did n't want to cook . And the portions , 

people do n't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals . I do that right now , -- Yeah . -- and I 'm not near nursing home age . Although they 've got , uh , Meals On Wheels , Yeah . Which I understand is a really good , you know , way to handle that so that at least they eat . Uh-huh . So as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there was n't a whole lot of choice . No , I do n't think there was . Um , I know a little bit more from a , a co-worker . Her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in . Uh-huh . 

Um , she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care . Uh , then she got , uh , uh , hip broken and then , uh , she was n't as ambulatory so they -- Uh-huh . -- were almost , you know , to the point of saying she ca n't be here anymore . But , I remember from her checking around , she ended up staying at the Arkansas House I think out in Arlington , something like that . Uh-huh . And , uh , you know the type of facilities whether it 's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh , a , uh , bathroom . All of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items . Oh yeah . That 's a given . 

They 're always saying that somebody 's going to , and some of them , I think unconsciously do it , you know , Uh-huh . as a just , you know , half seni- , And sometimes the , the help there does it , I think . Uh . So , they , they , uh , do n't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items . Uh-huh . 

Very limited space waste but , um , at least they all seem to have , uh , you know , people that monitor their , uh , medication intake and dining facilities , you know , go to the dining room -- Uh-huh . -- and , and eat some good meals . I know when my friend 's mother-in-law first went in , I mean , very antisocial . Maybe it takes a while for them to say , okay , well I 'll be with other people but , Adapt . Yeah , I do n't understand -- Yeah . -- that , they , they do n't want to be with anybody else . 

I , as I think I mentioned , I was in the trust business and I 've seen so many elderly people . Usually there has to be some wealth involved , which is great , if , if you 're financially , if , if you do n't make the decisions so late that you 're worried about money but -- Uh-huh . -- the , the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the , the retirement places where , where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better , as far as elderly people adapting . They 're able to move in while they 're still independent -- Uh-huh . -- and still social and , and they do group things . And then if health or , or mental capacity deteriorates , they 're able to take the next steps without so much change and oh , I wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they 've always been in . It 's really kind of difficult . Yeah , I have a , um , 

my aunt 's mother is , uh , gotten ill recently and , uh , she lives in Pennsylvania , they live in Alabama . And they 're saying , hey , we need you to be closer and -- Yeah . -- you have , women like that , I do n't to men , it seems like the women out just out live their husbands , but , very reluctantly , that -- Uh-huh . -- whole , I mean they do n't get out of the house , they do n't socialize but it 's my home and I do n't want to leave it . Well and it 's the first step in , in actually accepting that you are failing and , and aging . Uh . You know once you make that step you know that it 's just going to be downhill from then on and , and I 've seen people really fight it that desperately needed -- Um . -- to make the change . 

They , they became , in fact , that 's probably what 's going to happen with my husband 's mother . She 's going to endanger herself before she 'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision . And that scares me the , the thought of forcing somebody to do something . But it 's , it 's so lonely , you know they ca n't get out and see anyone and -- Yeah . -- I mean , it 's hard for , for someone like me to understand that because I th , I think , what do you have there ? It 's a house , Uh-huh . it 's walls and it 's furniture but -- Not as independence . -- there 's nobody there . 

Do n't you want to be close to me ? .  I mean , you know -- Yeah . -- be with other people . I just do n't understand why they , so much want to just stay in -- Uh-huh . -- that building . Uh-huh . And there 's no family there , they do n't get to see their grandkids , they do n't get to see their children , they just there in that house . Yeah . And the quality of life really is n't there . Yeah . Oh it 's tough , it really is . That 's from the child 's standpoint . 

The child is going , why do n't you want to be close to me and your other family . Uh-huh . What does that house got attraction ? Well , they fear being dependent -- I know they 're really proud of independence . -- on somebody . They , they fear being a burden -- Uh . -- to , to family members . My husband 's mother will have major surgery 

and we 'll find out about it in a casual conversation .  She 'll let something slip and we 'll say , wait a minute . And , and that 's it , she , just , well I did n't want to bother you . She ca n't accept that we want to be the care givers . Well , when she got home , who took care of her ? Yeah . Well , she stayed , she stayed in a temporary nursing home . Oh . Until she was okay . 

You know , it 's just , but it 's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her . She 's down in Temple -- Uh-huh . -- and we ca n't see her often enough to really know what 's going on . Um . So , it 's difficult , it really is and we 're all heading that way and , Yeah , my ,  husband and I , we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station and we 've pretty much planned that we 'll be here in the Dallas area and -- Uh-huh . -- there 's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they 're retired . So we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here . Yeah .
