Wh , what 's -- Uh . -- your , uh , are you into the Cowboys ? Oh , God , no . Uh , no , 

I 'm not , I have n't been , I grew up in Dallas but I 'm still not a Cowboys ' man . I like Philadelphia Eagles . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . Well , that -- That 's my favorite team , so . -- that 's all right . Uh , now that Randall 's coming back next season , I hope they 'll be , do a little bit better . They did n't do too bad last season . Yeah . But , I hope they can do better . How about yourself ? Well , I do n't know . 

I kind of go back and forth , uh , depending on who 's really hot and who 's not . I guess I 'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects . Uh-huh . But , uh , I guess if I have , uh , my druthers , I 'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks . Oh , tha- , I kind of like them . Yeah . That 's another one of my favorites . Yeah . They 're kind of , They 're not , they 're not my favorite totally . But I do like them . I like , yeah . Yo- , Seahawks are good . They , now that Steve Largent is gone , I kind of lose a little bit for them but -- Yeah . -- you know , he , To be honest with you , I , I probably watch , uh , college a little bit more than I do pro . Really ? Yeah . Huh . I kind of like college actually . Quite a bit . Yeah . That 's kind of , that 's kind of strange . It 's too much running for me in , in college football . I like -- Is it ? -- I like the pros . 

They do , you know , it 's more high tech , more , you know , players are apt to act a little bit different when they , when their jobs and their , when it 's a job and not just , you know -- Yeah , yeah . That could be . -- when you 're getting paid millions to do it , you ac- , I think they take it to another level . Yeah . But I can see it 's more , you know , grunted out , run the ball type . College football is a little bit different but , Yeah . 

You probably would n't like my favorite team in college then . Who , who 's that ? Notre Dame ? No . I root for Nebraska quite a bit . 

N- , Nebraska . Yeah there 's a running team . Ye- , . Yeah . That , that , that 's boring for me . I , I 'll take the passing teams any day . Yeah . But , 

Well , I can see , I can see definitely how you get into that . I , to be honest with you , I find th- , that too much running gets pretty boring as well and . Yeah . It 's just , it 's four yards , three yards -- Right . -- eight yards , tackle . 

That 's , you know , it gets kind of monotonous . After awhile , I , I prefer forty , a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just , just to -- Sure . -- juice it up a little bit and but , Well , I think they 're starting to realize that . A lot of the , like the big eight teams that used to run so much . I think they 're starting to realize that they just ca n't compete anymore . Yeah . It 's high dollar . You know , it 's all , it 's all money now . Even college is all -- Right . -- can we get on T V so . Yeah . That 's , that 's , So , uh , what 's d- , this World League is coming in ? Uh , that 's getting ready to start up , right ? Right . Yeah . Have you followed that very much or , Uh , not really . 

I , I do n't think anything will ever take over the N F L . I think -- Yeah . -- it 's basically , you know , it 's , it 's an institution . It 's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball . It 's just , I just , you know . Yeah . I mean , it , it , it can be , it can take over part of it . But it 's never going to be the next , Right . 

It can take over a small market share but nothing really , Yeah . MUMBLEx it 's going to take a little bit . Some people are going to watch it but it 's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday afternoon or anything , you know . Right . It 's just , it 's never going to reach that , that standard but , Yeah . I think I agree with you . 

It 's , it 's kind of interesting to see , uh , to see their claim of , you know , like world football . But , when in reality , it 's really Americans playing somewhere else you know . Yeah , yeah . It 's kind of , it 's kind of strange . Uh , I guess we 're the only ones , who take it that far . Everybody else still nuts over soccer but , Yeah . Actually , uh , I kind of like soccer . 

I 've -- Yeah ? -- never really played it but , uh , I like the idea . It 's , it 's an interesting game to watch . That and rugby . I 've like to watch , rugby every now and then . Yeah or Australian rules football . That 's , Yeah , whatever you want to call it there . Yeah . That 's some brutal stuff there . 

That 's , that 's worse than football as far as violence I think . Golly . Those guys kill each other out there . Rugby is something else . Yeah , MUMBLEx . Yeah , there 's an element there 's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere . Yeah . That 's just wild . That 's why it 's a go- , a big college thing . Yeah Rugby is definitely big in college because it 's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do . Right , exactly . Yeah . Tha- , So , yeah , I could see the feel for that . But it 's , it 's pretty , it 's fun to play . Yeah . I 'll give it that . It is fun to play . If you do n't value your -- You 've played it then ? -- very much . But , you know , I do n't think rugby will ever be professional but -- No I doubt it , you know . Not , at -- 

-- it , it 's , it 's , -- least not in this country anyway . No . You ca n't stay healthy and do that . That 's a rough game . Yeah . It is . But , uh , I do n't know . I do n't know how my Eagles are going to do this year . 

So you , the , the Seahawks are an up and down kind of team . They really are . Yeah . Yeah . 

My , my , it 's kind of odd . My roommate that I live with here , he 's , uh , he 's lived in Pennock , Minnesota . Do you know where that is ? Uh , no I do n't . To tell you the truth , I 'm , It , it 's a small town . It 's about two hours , it 's in like central Minnesota . It 's a couple of hours , uh , west of Minneapolis . Okay . 

But , uh , To tell you the truth , I 'm not even really from here . You just live there now . Yeah . I 'm , I 'm up here for a year on an internship . Uh-huh . Well he 's , But I , I actually live in Florida . Live in Florida . Yeah . Like the Seahawks . 

Well , you know , I . Hey , I , I -- I mean , who , who -- -- I 've only been to Philadelphia twice and I , you know , I , I still like , -- who the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay , right ? Really , really . I mean , I guess I could go for Miami but -- Yeah , but . 

-- I do n't know . I 'm from , I root for Nebraska so I 'm , I do n't have a real love for Miami anyway . But , I do n't know , I , I guess , I get , into pretty much ,
