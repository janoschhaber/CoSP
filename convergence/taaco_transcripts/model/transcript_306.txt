Okay . Um , Where do you live ? In Plano . In Plano ? Yes . 

Where do you live ? In Dallas . Oh , okay . Uh , the air pollution is n't too bad in our area . So , we 're very fortunate -- Huh . -- but I know in some areas , it 's really , it , it really is bad . Um , I was trying to think , uh , something we were watching the other day and they were doing an overview of Los Angeles , uh , from an area that was up higher and you literally could see the band of smog . That , uh , I 've never been out there , but , I have n't either . it was , it was quite evident that , Uh-huh . it was a real brown area and , Well , I think it would be terrible to live in an area like that and , unfortunately , I think there are a lot of areas that are , that , that bad . Yeah . Particularly in the areas where there are industries , uh , where they are burning a lot of coal , Yes . 

and oil -- Yeah . -- up , more up north , I guess , uh , I think it 's a bigger problem . With the car pollution , anti-pollution devices , I think , uh , air is n't as bad it once was , from the cars , because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area . Yes . 

Well , I know , uh , that 's been the concern in Europe . They had n't , uh , we have friends in Germany and , uh , have family that live near the Black Forest area and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we , s , uh , switched to the unleaded gas and , and had the emission control advice , uh , , devices required on the cars , uh , that 's something that Europe did n't do right away and now they 're doing that and I guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country , that 's the only pollution that 's been there . It 's not an area that is industry but they were losing a lot of , uh , trees and a lot of , 

From acid rain ? Um , I guess . From , from something that the car was , uh , was giving , I think it gives off , uh , in the emissions , it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere , uh , and form a , a weak acid . Yes , and , It just makes the rain fall on the acid side and after a period of time , I think that accumulates in , uh , trees because they take it up through their roots , as well as it landing on the leaves , on surfaces , like you 've seen what it 's done to buildings even -- Yes . -- where it 's really bad . Yeah . What 's interesting , several years ago , I took a course , uh , on , uh , well , it was actually , it was put on by the power companies and , about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was , and there was n't from various kinds of , of energy . And , uh , at that point in time , one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain and it was kind of pooh-poohed , you know . Oh , you 're making a mountain out of a molehill , kind of thing . And it 's turned out that , that 's been very true , what he was forecasting about the accumulation of , of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage . So , it 's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when I took that course . Now , a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear . Uh , I 'm not afraid of nuclear , having had that course because of how the nuclear that , uh , they use is not bomb quality , and , we 're so strict with all our controls in the United States . The chances of , of an accident are slight , and , it does n't pollute the air at all . It 's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant . Many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants . It 's kind of funny because people are just petrified , at least some are , at the thought of nuclear . Yes . So , I do n't know . In Europe there 's a lot of dependency on nuclear power and they recycle the fuel and then instead of , of , some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they 're afraid it could become , uh , bomb quality . But , that 's the only sensible thing to do , is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground . As far as I 'm concerned , where it could eventually , perhaps , there 's some problem , uh , pollute the groundwater . So , I do n't know what the answer is . The best answer , of course , would be solar or , uh , fusion , or something clean . Yes . Well , we 've got a problem on the line , do n't we . Yeah . I , I get that sometimes , um , my line gets some static . I do n't know why . Uh-huh . But , uh , solar , of course , would be the clean , the cleanest . Well , I know it 's MUMBLEx , um , we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston and , uh , oddly enough I thought our part of the country was ideal . I ca n't hear you at all for all this static . Oh . I do n't know what to , usually it 's the other phone I have trouble with . It must just , be on the line . Can you hear me ? Now I can again . Okay . I do n't know what , uh , I , I do n't know what the problem is but , uh , when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater and -- 

-- we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy and we have enough clouds that , uh , there are other areas that would be better suited . That surprised me because I think , we have a tremendous amount of , um , sunny days . Uh-huh . And , and it , yes , it can be used and it can help but , uh , that was a problem that they were still working on . But , 

Oh yeah . It , it 's still got a long way to go . Well I , It 's just , you know , a possible solution -- Yes . -- in the future , I think , maybe to help in some ways . It may not in all ways . Maybe they 'll come up with fusion . You know , con- , be able to control it . I do n't know how long that 'll take , but , one of these days , because that 's perfectly clean . Yes . It 's just we ca n't control it . Right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out , so , it is n't , not at all , and you ca n't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field , so that 's not going to work . At least not now . But , uh , who knows what the future will hold . Uh , as far as energy goes , I , I think , with solving some of the energy , future energy problems , we 'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well . Uh , I hope so . I do to . I like to be optimistic , I do n't like to be pessimistic about these things . Well , I do think , um , 

I mean , you 've already mentioned several things , I think , uh , just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in , uh , We have one earth , Yes . to live on and we got to take care of it . Yes . Well , -- Uh-huh . -- and , and for the future generations , too . Uh , I 've noticed students are , are much more , you know , young , young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment -- Yes . -- and protecting the earth . And so , if we can raise it , uh , you know , generations with those concerns , we 'll solve a lot of our problems . 

I 'm afraid , I know I was part of the me generation where they did n't , MUMBLEx so many of them did n't , people did n't care . You know , it 's whatever , you know , recycle , well , if it 's a problem , forget that . Uh , not throw the trash out the car window and leave it in the car and then throw it away ? How horrible , you know . Now , I 've always done those kinds of things because I just did n't like messes , and ...
