Okay . Okay . Well what do you think about the idea of , uh , kids having to do public service work for a year ? Do you think it 's a , Well , I , I think it 's a pretty good idea . 

I think they should either do that , or , or afford some time to the military , or , or helping elderly people . Yes , yes , def- , I , I , you know , I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and , and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home and -- That 's true . -- I 'm not sure that that 's not a bad idea and , or the military for a year or two , Yeah . would n't be bad for , I think it teaches kids how to grow . How about yourself ? Uh , I agree with you . Uh , uh , what I 'm thinking about is back , well , when I was a kid , and much earlier than that , kids were kind of , i- , i- , 

you know , the parents kind of pushed them to join , like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts and they did , do , do do a lot of public service activities , but these days they 're not , uh , par- , parents are n't encouraging their kids to do things like that . Because when I was in the Girl Scouts , we did a lot of public service things , because that 's just part o- , of , of the scouting , and , you know . Yeah , I 've , I 've , that 's really great . I , I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent , two excellent organizations . They are 

but parents , You know , kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that , Yeah , they do . and they do n't follow it at all , you know . There are very few Scouts go on , Oh , no . and become Eagle Scouts . And , and I do n't know what the high rank is for the gals but , I , I , uh , senior . Oh . Senior , okay . So , there 's not , uh , Oh , they 're just not , 

once they get into junior high it just , Yeah , they , they lose interest . not done anymore . and then when they young , young adults , Uh-huh . there 's even less interest there . They 're more for , I g , Me . Not , not , yeah . Grab , grab , grab , walk out . Yeah , you 're absolutely right . Yeah I think it 's a really a good thing . I , I like to see , of course , there 's , you know , third world countries that can use all kind of help . Yeah , but there 's a lot that can be done right here in this country , 

But I think , too . we ought to start right here at home . I 'm , you know , Yeah , uh , I 'm not , I 'm not so sure that overseas help , helping overseas would be such a hot idea for , for , uh , a lot of young k- , people . No , it , it , But , since there is much that needs to be done here . I think that , yeah , I think that we need to really address what we 've done here 

and , and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook . Uh-huh . Well , it 's been really good . We talked about this for a few minutes , and , uh , hopefully , we 'll have other good topic maybe another call someday , but I , I do n't really have too much more to say on this topic , I guess . No , I , I agree with you . It , we , I guess we both agree that it 's a good thing , Yeah . that they should do sometime . Okay . 

Well you take care , and , and , You , too . enjoy the day . You , too . Thank you , ma'am . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
