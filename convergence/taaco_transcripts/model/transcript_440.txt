Uh , well , uh , to begin , I guess , uh , space is , uh , real important , I think , so it 's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time , I guess . So . Yeah , I , I agree -- Uh . 

-- it 's definitely new frontier stuff . So , uh , but , uh , I 'm not too up-to-date on the space , on the space frontier , but , uh , I guess they 're going , going pretty far into it now . Um , Star Wars is not too far I do n't think . But , uh , 

I , I , I worked on some of it at T I -- Oh , have you . -- once upon a time . Yeah . So what do you know about it . Well , actually I 'm , I , I 'm quite versed lately . I get on a computer network all the time , and people are talking about , about the current space program all the time . They 're talking about new rockets that they 're designing now that , you know , are just like science fiction , you know , it 's like they , take off , you know , and then they land , with the , with the , you know , the afterburners are going , you know , not like space shuttle landing , you know , gliding down , but -- Really . -- straight down to the landing pad . Oh , my gosh . Yeah , it 's called V C X or something like that . Also called Delta Clipper , which is a decent name for -- Wow . -- something like that . Well , I do n't know . 

You think you 'd , you think you 'd , uh , go up in space if you had a chance ? Oh , yeah -- Do you , -- I think I would . I think that 'd be neat . I think I would just sitting here talking about it , but if the time came , it 'd be real nervous . I 'd be scared , scared me worse than Six Flags roller coaster . That 'd be pretty hairy . 

Well , you know , I had a car , uh , uh , a tire come off of a car , so you know , I , like I know what it 's like to , Yeah , imagine . Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home . Right , right . So , well , I guess they 're talking about people going to the moon and stuff , now , wherever . Yeah , they 're talking about doing that again , too . And opening up those stations , whatever , filling them . Uh-huh . I do n't know if we 'll ever see that up there . Well at least we 're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years . 

Oh , really . Yeah , and they 're going to put , That 's all beyond my imagination really . Yeah . 

But , science fiction books , I mean , you look at the Jetsons , you know , cartoon show , and it 's not too far fetched what , what they all had in those cartoons , so you never know . Oh , yeah , yeah . Any of that stuff from the Jetsons , from that cartoon , that you would never imagine would come , become possible , and now you , we have a lot of those , so , Uh-huh . 

So you never know what , what may occur , but -- Yeah . -- as far as me seeing it , you know , I do n't know . I do n't know , but I think it 's real vital important for the future , you know -- Uh-huh . -- generations to come , so . Yeah , 

I , uh , it 's , it 's , it 's something definitely that , uh , you know , it 's , it 's , uh , got the extra little oomph of interest . Yeah . Uh . I 'm sure it 'll draw a lot more interest too , once it becomes , you know , like it 's more possible , but -- Yeah . -- when they start showing the drawings and all that , I 'm sure , you know , when they , Yeah , I wish , uh , 

like , uh , Boeing or -- Right . -- McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy , uh , a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it , you know , purely commercial -- Uh-huh . -- and they 'd go up , you know , and do things and , 

So did they scratch those , uh , that Star Wars deal , you know , they one we was all worried about -- Oh . -- Russia and all that ? No , it 's still probably going , 

but I do n't know whether , it , it , research will go on . Yeah , but the economy the way it is all over , they probably cut back on -- Oh , yeah . 

-- on that , because it 's not , Well , they 're , they 're going to be cutting back so much on just , you know , the number of troops we 've got in Europe and the number -- Right . -- of troops we have here . Yeah , I know , and then , But , uh , Russia 's still going to have missiles , they 're still going to be subs and things . Yeah , and we do n't know who 's handling them now -- Yeah . -- so that 's a whole different story now . Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia that , Russia itself that was going to have them . Oh , really . At least that was , you know , that 's what everybody says . Oh , yeah , yeah , we want only Russia to have them . Uh-huh . And now they 're saying , Yeah , yeah , you 're a republic , you do n't want those , you do n't want those . MUMBLEx . Some crazy hit man over there so , with those little republican- , republics or whatever they splitting it all up now , 

and one of them crazy -- Uh-huh . -- crazy guys get a hold of it , you never know . But that , the guy that 's taken over for Gorbachev , he 's supposed to be , he 's supposed to be on our side , is n't he . Pretty much . One hopes . Uh-huh . I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects so , Uh-huh . But that way , you ca n't never tell that . Yeah . Kiss some butt , but , but , uh ,
