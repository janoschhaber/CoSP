Recently graduated from high school . Meaning like , uh , you know , three or four years ago . I 'm a senior in , in , uh , college now . Uh-huh . And , uh , I ca n't really talk too much about the problems with , uh , public education in detail because the school system I went to was , uh , really superb even though it was a public school -- Really ? -- system . Yeah . I feel that my , uh , I 'm a junior in college now . And -- Oh . Okay . -- I go to Tech , Georgia Tech ? Yeah . And I , I got a friend who goes there , by the way . I want to as- , talk to you about that afterward , okay . Okay . Uh , I 've , the high school I went to was , uh , was a good one also . 

And I , well , I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools . Because the one I went to was , you know , I 'm sure a , a lot nicer than , you know , a lot of the inner city schools and -- Yeah . -- the things around Atlanta . Yeah . It was a , a , it 's a more or less a suburban school system ? Yeah . Yes . That , that was true for mine too . Uh , although I I 'm sure to some extent , that money is part of the problem in the disparity , but I do n't think , I honestly do n't think that 's the biggest part of it . You know , I -- 

What d- , -- think that , uh , I mean I know that in my town , you know , most of the , most of the parents , they 're valued education . And , uh -- Yeah , 

that 's true . -- you know , and so the students were , you know , to some extent , motivated to learn . I mean -- Yeah . 

And I 'm also -- -- you know . -- I mean , in the , in those places where , uh , like the economy is really bad , they might , you know , be more tempted to , to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the , you know , money to put food on the table and stuff like that . More than they would , you know , in areas where they yeah , Yeah , that 's true . But , but , uh , I think , I mean even more than that , even , I mean if you drop out in high school -- Uh-huh . -- you should still be able to read , you know ? Yeah . That 's true . Which it MUMBLEx , I mean it sounds like , uh , now I think maybe it 's started changing in the past few years because , uh , they have of these , uh , sort of mandatory , -tory tests if you have to take before you get -- Right . -- a diploma . But , uh , 

but , uh , certainly before that , there were people that , you know , would graduate from high school and could barely read . Uh , and that 's just sort of inexcusable and you ca n't really , I , I , I mean I just ca n't even picture how that could happen . Yeah . You know , except maybe to someone who 's , you know , really badly learning , uh , disabled or something . But these people obviously were n't . That 's hard for me to say since I did n't , I did n't really grow , well when I went to elementary school it , it was n't in a great area but I still , I mean , I learned to read , started learning to read when I was in kindergarten , you know . Yeah . So I guess I ca n't really -- Yeah . -- I ca n't say what it would be like to , uh , grow up in a really oppressed region . Yeah . You know , I guess the whole , the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the MUMBLEx people . Yeah . And I think that 's almost a bigger factor , than anything else probably . I mean , I do n't , I think you know , people just , So , I guess the problem is the , the thing to do is to try to , uh , to get some kind of motivation to learn and , Yeah . And , again , I do n't , I mean they got to know the , you know , how qualified , I mean , MUMBLEx 

I think it 'd be interesting -- Uh-huh . -- to , you know , to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school . Uh , you know , sort , sort of maybe from elementary through , uh , high school . Yeah . You know , just sort of to get a feel for what it 's like . Uh-huh . I think that 'd be an interesting experience . But , uh , I have n't done that . No , 

I , I ca n't say that I have either . But , uh , But I do , I do think that , uh , I mean , public education in general I think can work . And I think it 's a good thing . Yeah . I 've , I 've heard some , I mean I 've heard sta- , sta- , statistics and things that , that compare a public education to a private education . I mean within like , within the same , uh , income groups . Yeah . If you compare the , like the people that could have , that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that , you know , the people that , uh , did send their kids to private -- Yes . 

-- schools . I think they compare fair- , you know , fairly well . Yeah . Yeah . I mean , I do n't , I honestly do n't really think I could have , you know , done much better than I did in the school system I was in . Yeah . I mean . I , I , I , my schools , I mean , there , I have a lot of once , once it seemed I got into high school , they had a lot of , uh , MUMBLEx accelerated programs and all kinds of -- Yeah . -- stuff like that . That , I mean , that makes a big difference cause I wondered when they 're taking classes with , uh , with people that are really , are interested in the , the subject and stuff like that . Yeah . I mean , and and in the , once you book junior high , uh , start junior high , starting in eighth grade all the way through high school , there were four levels . Well , no , I guess it wa- , in junior high , it was still three . Then in high school it changed into four levels of , uh , of instruction in the major subjects . Uh-huh . 

Uh , which , I mean , actually I think that works pretty well . MUMBLEx and that , that makes ,
