Um , I think life , uh , now I grew up on a farm , I do n't , what kind did you grow up in the farm . I grew up in , um , 

well , at that time I was in a , uh , Trenton , New Jersey so , and it was a suburb of Trenton , so I really had mixture of suburb , Uh-huh . and urban living . Yeah . I think though it was much slower and , uh , much more self-contained . I think you 're right . It 's interesting I 'm , um , I work in a high school . Uh-huh . So , uh , I 'm comparing my life when I was in high school thirty years ago to what I see these children doing . Yes . And the pressures on the children , uh , you know , you hear this as an excuse , but it 's true they are so much greater . 

Unreal , unreal by comparison . Oh , I can not believe , uh , what they 're doing , uh , academically the demands on them and , uh , and I can see why children do drop out . Yeah , I think that 's right . I can see , I can see the , uh , you know , I , I can remember as a child , you know , nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where I wanted to go . Uh-huh , uh-huh . It was n't , it did n't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me 

they were , And you , you did n't , you did n't have to lock your door . No , no . And , uh , a lo- , some of these are urban worries but , uh , it 's , uh , it 's a lot different all though I guess twenty years a go now , in this area , things were , um , similar because twenty years ago let 's see , it was after , 

It 's not all that long ago is it . yeah , to twenty , twenty-five years ago is when we had the Washington riots , Uh-huh , uh-huh . the first rights we 've been having some problem now and it reminded me of that . Yeah , we were living in New Jersey . Uh-huh . Uh , in , twenty years ago . Whereabouts ? In Allendale . Uh-huh . And , uh , I use to have to go over to Patterson when those riots were going on , Uh-huh . at sometimes . Um , I do n't know though 

it 's , it 's kind of hard to really know because of though the news media had those riots , uh , kind of blown up out of proportion . Uh-huh , well , because I went there many times and , the Washington riots were n't , because , The Washington riots were n't 

because I lived right downtown , Washington and , uh , and what you saw is was what you got . I 'm telling you . That 's what , yeah , well . Yeah , but , you know , it 's , it is interesting , uh , they 're so many mor- , they 're different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures , uh , the pressures of drug is so much , the prevalence is so much greater , Uh-huh . the , the kinds of diseases that you 've got out the , uh , um , Uh-huh . I mean the consequences is 

so much of what 's going on , I think that 's true , I think that 's true . is so much more serious then when we were younger . 

I think the other thing is that , uh , we have taken some rather drastic turns in our , in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when , when I 'm number one , you know , and , uh , uh , uh , worrying about self and not , uh , seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family . Uh-huh , uh-huh . And , uh , and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged closeness of families and , uh , support for young people that the kind of support that they need , Yes , and , to help them take care of the things , if you do n't have some kind of , of basic believe or something down inside of you , Uh-huh . then it 's very difficult to , uh , have anything to turn to , That 's true . when you got , when you 've got something facing you like that . I also being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents , um , children who will lie and cheat and you approach their parents , and their parents are constantly justify them rather then to , Uh-huh . uh , you know , they 're constantly , Like MUMBLEx . 

excusing their , Right . child and you can see exactly , Yeah exactly . why the child is that way . You can as a teacher , ca n't hold a child accountable , Yeah . if you 're not going to get reinforced by , That 's right . that at home . that 's right . And you ca n't make up in a classroom of one hour a day , No . what 's not been done for , That 's right . fifteen or sixteen years at home , Oh . and you 're , you get mixed signals so it 's , it 's not always the school 's systems I think a lot of , No , there 's so much more , then that it starts , yeah . very much deeper then that I think that too . I see some flickers of , of , uh , of good directions turning , No . but whether they 're soon enough and fast enough I do n't know , it 's just , Of course , life is a lot more complicated too in ways , um , the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained , Right . for now . Uh , you know , with farming being so mechanized , Uh-huh . uh , people working on the family farm which was a traditional American way that becomes less and less likely , factory jobs are so much more , um , uh , sophisticated . Yeah , that 's right . And the kinds of knowledge that , uh , you know , it , it 's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force and , Right . some people just do n't have it . 

And there 's so much , so , so many people on the lower end of those who , who are going to be the , the drop outs and the , And you worry when , and the poor and the homeless and whatnot , you know these the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children , Yeah , 

that 's just another , uh , in terms of what it 's going to mean to a society , Yeah . in the future it 's a some ways it 's rather frightening , It really is 

it 's just , it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think , It certainly is . of , of the jobs that is out there to be done , Well , it sure is . in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be , It sure is . Uh , not that I really think that they were perfect ten , twenty , or thirty years ago , but , It was a little easier though was n't it ? Uh , yeah , just the volume makes a big difference , Yes . I think as , uh , as , uh , mother you know , I use to think sometimes it 's not so much , uh , it 's not so much the kids , it 's just the volume of it , to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and , you know , and everything . Right . uh , I look at my mother 's life I mean she , she did n't work , um , um , for a long time whe , when I was very young she did n't drive . Uh , she learned to drive I think when I was , um , a teenager , and her life was a lot simpler , Right and , and I sit here , and children 's lives were simpler because mother was there , somebody was there . That 's right . And , and when there 's nobody there , That 's right , that 's right . I always thought too that , you know , people worrying about going to work when their child , when their children are little and I , and I think that 's sad if they have to because they miss so much , but I , I believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go , They need you more as a teenager . to go work was when they were teenagers . Is n't that true . That 's why I 'm working in a school system so that I 'm home when they 're home . Um , Right , it 's not so much that they come to you every minute , but it 's that you are there when they need you . That 's exac- , is n't that , that 's so true , Yeah . 

uh , uh , I find working in a high school is very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do , Yeah . and it keeps me from being the old fogy so , but at the same time , it also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes , Yes , I think that 's true . as to what 's com- , 

but that 's the same I 'm home in the summers , I 'm home with the holidays , Yeah , that 's , I 'm home at three o clock when the children are at home or where home , Yeah . one is now a senior in high school and the other 's in college , Well , and , uh , But that helps a lot , It 's , uh , it , uh , it does , 

I have a daughter who just had a second job , she needed to work and he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her . Uh-huh , uh-huh . And , uh , and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so they she would be able to interact with them , That 's right . and , uh , and so I , MUMBLEx , you know , good kind of experience as well but , uh , Well I , I think that 's really important I do n't think people realize how important it is . That 's , that is , that is so true , Yeah , uh , and it 's not that always that the children always say something but every once in awhile they 'll come up and make a comment , Yeah . and you realize it 's important that , uh , and yet , you know , we have to make that choice 

I think twenty , thirty years ago a lot of women , Yeah . just did n't have to make that choice . I think that 's right . What was , what was your name again ? 

Well , I , Linda Lee . Linda . Uh-huh . Okay . And your name was ? Well I think probably that we 've just about . 

Well I enjoyed , I 'm going to , talking with you . 

change the world but , uh , Well , I enjoyed talking with you . Yes , it 's nice talking to you , too . Okay . Bye now . Bye-bye .
