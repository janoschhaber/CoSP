The question was on lawn and garden work . Um , how do you like it ? Well , I do n't do much of it here . I 'm from , uh , Te- , from , uh , Colorado originally and there are no bugs there . And I did n't mind getting in the dirt there , 

but , boy , I 'll tell you what , once I see these bugs around here , I 'm just kind of out of it . Oh , what kind do you have ? . Oh , roaches and , Do they really ? Oh , yes . 

Cockroaches are awful here . Oh . Just awful . So I , Oh , and I know somebody that lives there , and they never mentioned that problem . 

Oh , you 're kidding , you 're kidding . No , it 's a d- , well , maybe they did n't mention it because it 's just kind of a fact of life around here . And , uh , Oh , my . 

They probably just take it for granted then . It must be . If they lived here , a lot of people I know just say , oh , I just stomp on them . It does n't matter . They make good fertilizer in the garden . Oh , yuck . Me , personally ca n't , 

MUMBLEx I do n't have that problem , uh , it 's , mine is mainly we kind of have an understanding that , uh , I , I said I 'll do inside work you do outside work . Uh-huh . And so I get into the gardening part of it , the fun part , like putting in the annuals and things like that . Uh-huh . But I do n't like , I do n't like it dirty . No . I have to , you know I have to say that 's not exactly my favorite thing either really . No , 

I do n't know . We got the , we got the question and I thought , oh , this is going to be interesting . Two bits I 'll get a man to talk to me , because they get stuck doing it all . But although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work . And this year we put in a new lawn in a new home so , um , we 've been fighting a drought here this summer -- Huh . -- and getting into fall . Today we just had a lot of rain . Oh , really ? Yeah , so it 's kind of nice . I do n't know how yours has been . Well , it 's been real hot here lately . I mean we 've had to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything but , uh , doe , 

it 's supposed to rain again now , uh , this weekend . Oh , I see . So , then , Okay . Well , we 're leaving tomorrow and we 're going down to New Orleans and from Ohio since we 're right near Lake Erie this is going to be a switch for us for a week -- Yeah . -- going down there , and I think we 'll probably experience some of your weather although I think they have more humidity . But , um , Yeah . as far as the gardening and things like that goes I do n't know , uh , too much , too much about , uh , how much I really r- , do enjoy it myself . Do you like it at all ? I , well , not here . 

I mean it 's just , here I just ca n't stand to even get out in the , uh , in the dirt . Just , Well , how about when you were in Colorado ? 

Well , I liked it a little bit but I did n't , uh , I was working at that time full-time and did n't have a lot of time , Uh-huh . for that and so that I think really , um , hampered it a little bit . Well , and then , too , now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly . My water bill was high . And , uh , if you have that on a regular basis in Texas , I think I would go with something very dry to keep it off , you know . Yeah . But , uh , and with children , um , you probably do n't have time anyhow -- No . -- to , to get into it . Not really . It 's so , uh , okay , very good . . Uh-huh . I guess we 've kind of covered our subject matter , Sounds like i- , since neither one is really into gardening , are we ? No , no . Afraid not . Uh , hopefully they 'll give a subject I like one of these times . Right . Okay . Something I really know a lot about . Right . Wh , nice talking to you . Nice talking with you . Okay , bye-bye . Uh-huh , bye .
