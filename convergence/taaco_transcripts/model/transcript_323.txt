So do you have any recycling programs there ? Um , I do n't really think we have anything in the works as of yet . Uh-huh . Uh , we 're a pretty small town and , uh , the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of Wal-Mart -- Oh , uh-huh . -- that show , you know , plastics , paper -- Yeah . -- liter bottles , et cetera , et cetera . We 've progressed a little bit farther than that . Yeah . Um , actually they have , uh , parts of town , it may have even spread all over the whole town , and , um , they will have these green bins -- Uh-huh . -- and it 's just as standard as a , a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump . Yeah . And , uh , just along with a trash can you have this , this green plastic bin , and you put your bottles in it and paper and , uh , you know , all those things that wh- , aluminum . You know , anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin . Oh . And , uh , I guess you can al- , 

and a lot of the restaurants -- Yeah . -- they just have , uh , places where you can throw away , especially beer places , where you can throw away green bottles , Huh . and then the brown bottles . And , uh , oh , I do n't know , I guess they 're , you know , clear bottles . Yeah . So , um , you know a lot of people do have those separated . And , of course , they have the , um , dumpsters , uh , the , the igloos . Yeah . Uh , and they have those strateg- , strategically placed around the city . Oh . And , uh , they 're , they 're actually going to extend it , I think , one of these days maybe to apartment complexes and , uh , 

Oh , that would be good . Yeah , things of that nature . So , I guess when you live in a bigger city it , it really becomes , uh , Yeah , see , necessary . 

it 's not anywhere near that . Uh , we , you know , as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans . Oh , yeah . But that 's as far as we go because I take them to a girl at work , and she goes and cashes them in because , you know , I just -- Uh-huh . -- I can do that for her and -- Yeah . -- and I do n't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it . Oh , really ? Yeah , Huh . see we do n't have anything here in Belton . It 's , it 's a pretty small little town . Yeah , 

I remember my grandparents and I used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans . Yeah . And , uh , So , you know , that 's about all the , that we 're doing here . Uh , they 're , uh , getting a little bit more on , they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle , and what can you recycle and what you ca n't . Uh-huh . Because , you know , not a lot of people do really know what , you know , what it 's for . Yeah , they 're doing a real good job of , uh , separating it here . And , of course , there you know you have a specific place to put your paper . Yeah . And , uh , they try to get you to go ahead and separate it , but they actually have the door to door pickup . Um , and it 's , uh , I think it started out to be , um , just kind of a test , a pilot project . Uh-huh . And it went over so well that they just extended it . And it 's almost , uh , I do n't know if it 's done by a private company or not . It may be . But , uh , they just go around to each , uh , door and pick it up . 

Wow , that 's excellent . Yeah . That 's good . Let 's see . Oh , and every year , of course , the phone books -- Yeah . -- um , they tell everybody across the city to , uh , put all their phone books in , uh , the , uh , recycle bins . Oh . Because , you know , phone books are pretty , well , for a bigger city they 're pretty thick . Yeah , 

they are . And sometimes you might have two or three . Exactly . So , uh , that 's , that 's a big savings right there in itself . Yeah , see ours just goes in the regular trash . Yeah , It just , huh . you know , there 's not a whole lot . 

And there are , you know , some places that will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff . Uh-huh . But usually it 's , it , it has n't caught on yet . I 'm hoping it will soon . Uh-huh . Well , the thing about newspapers and paper , recycled paper is actually very expensive . Yeah . 

So , when you see something that 's on recycled paper , they 've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that . It 's , uh , they 're not coming out ahead at all . It 's , uh , it 's really a cost . Huh . I was n't totally aware of that . Yeah . So . I mean it , it sounds good to the public 

but there 's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something . Now , aluminum I do n't know . They may be coming out ahead . But I know , Yeah . for a fact that the paper , uh , on that end they 're not , you know . It 's just good to recycle but it 's , uh , not to their advantage . Yeah . And it costs less . Huh . Well , 

I ca n't think of anything else . I ca n't either . Okay . Because we 're , we 're at a very , you know , beginning stages , so . Uh-huh . We look forward to it to get better MUMBLEx . Well , I hope you all , um , uh , come along a little farther in the future . Yeah , me too . It was nice talking to you . You too . Bye-bye . Bye .
