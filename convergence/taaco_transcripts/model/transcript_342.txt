Do you have any ? Sure . I have a Springer Spaniel , and her name is Thumper . She 's about seven or eight years old . I got her for Christmas from my family , and , uh , back when we lived in Nebraska . I like to hunt , and , uh , so , I thought that if I had a good hunting dog like Thumper that , boy , I could just go out and get all kinds of game . Did it work ? . Yeah , except we live in Plano , Texas now -- No , right . 

-- so . I , um , I had a , for many years I had a dog that was part Springer Spaniel . I just love them . Her name was Molly , but she is n't alive any more . We had her for , um , fifteen years , I think , my family did , and just loved her . She was the greatest , greatest , um , went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle . Do you have a pet now ? Yeah , I have a cat now . He just turned seven , also , and he 's , I , um , got him in Arizona -- Oh . -- and , when I used to live there , and he is huge . He is eighteen pounds . 

What kind of cat is it ? Just , um , I got him , he was , um , he was born in the wild , like in a , in a shed -- Uh-huh . -- and had never been in a building when I got him . So he , and he 's , he , he must be part , cross part with some kind of desert animal , because he 's very long and lanky , but he 's a very tame spoiled house cat , you know , now that I 've had him for seven years . Being born outside , you did n't have any problems house training him ? No , no -- 

That 's good . -- he 's , yeah , he 's great , and uh , he 's , uh , he 's really spoiled , though . So , but he 's really big , so , lots of times he , it , he seems to get in fights , and when he was younger I think he started them , and now , I think he barely makes it . I think he gets beat up even though he 's big , because he 's -- Sure . -- pretty much overweight , and -- 

And older . -- comes home with a few scratches now and then , yeah . Well , we went to a cat show at the Plano Center here in town , and , uh , we thought that , we have a cat now , but we thought , Well , if we ever get another cat , you know , we 'd want something kind of unique , so , we kind of looked around , and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats and we sort of fell in love with the , uh , Maine Coon cats . Oh , I 've seen them . I -- They 're huge . 

-- yeah , I have seen them . They , um , were n't they , they were actually , I ca n't remember , they were used to be used on ships and in , for , for mousers -- Oh . -- you know , so they 're very nautical , too . I 'll be darned . I did n't know that . Yeah , 

I just , uh , I think I 'm , I think I 'm being accurate in the , in the area of folklore , but I 'm not sure . Well that 's interesting . Yeah . We kind of like , well , my family did n't necessarily like , like them as much as I did , but the Manx , is that the one that does n't have a tail -- Yeah . -- it sort of has a bob tail . I kind of like that , too , but . Yeah . I 'd love to go to a cat show . I 'm real , a real cat lover . I 'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let u- , let me . He does n't really like mine , let alone another one . 

Well , I 'll tell you an interesting story about how I got my dog , and then I suppose our five minutes will be up . Yeah . Okay . I work for a university , and I went to , uh , Omaha , Nebraska to recruit students , and I had some time off in the afternoon , so I went to a , a pet shop , and I saw these little Springer Spaniels -- Um . -- and so I decided , well , you know , this would really be a nice dog to have , so , when I got back home to Carney , Nebraska , I told my wife about it , and I said , You know , this is just a , I , I , I can just hear the dog crying for me now . 

I know what you mean . And Christmas is coming up , hint , hint , and so , I had to go back the next week , as well as a bunch of other people from the university , and one of the people , uh , that we went with , uh , they were friends of ours , and so , we got to Omaha , and I decided I 'd take my friend over and show him the dog , and so I got over there , and she said , Oh , that 's too bad , the dog has already been sold . And I did n't realize it , but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier , bought the dog , and she was in the back room , and so that night we had a reception for some of the , uh , potential high school students or college students , and , and , uh , he had the dog the whole time in his room , and , and I had no idea . And so we headed back to Carney that night , and the dog rode in the car and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat and they left the dog in the car , and I guess while we were inside eating , Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car , and , uh , finally we made it back to , uh , to Carney and ,
