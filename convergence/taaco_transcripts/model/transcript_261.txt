Okay . Okay . So tell me about CHINA CRY . Okay , CHINA CRY was basically the , the true story written by this , this lady who had , uh , was a native , a native Chinese , uh , uh , who was raised by Christian parents . Uh-huh . And her , her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution . I see . Although she , herself , had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other , uh , Christian , uh , portions of , of the faith , repentance , baptisms , et cetera , et cetera . She had always felt a very strong , uh , leaning in this direction . And whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or their , all the clergy and so forth were killed or , or imprisoned or , and the property confiscated , she was safe because she had , you know , not officially joined the , the Christian movement . Uh-huh . So , anyway , she , as she grew up towards maturity , her parents , well , her dad was a doctor and , and he was rather well , you know , rather well to do in the old regime and the , the Chin- , the commu- , the communist Chinese did n't like this at all . You know , the bourgeoisie was , was , was definitely out of , uh , style , then . Right . Everybody was back to a commonality of one . And so they kept picking at him , picking at his , at her mother and , uh , finally , uh , started picking on her . Uh-huh . And getting her to , you know , they were starting to , uh , accuse her of , of , of , uh , crimes and atrocities before the , the revolution and , and had her write her own story over and over and over . Uh , and the , uh , the major point of the movie was that , that she had , uh , married this , this Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court . Now , I think I 'm leaving out a portion . She gr , she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had , uh , gotten a job as , as an instructor and they had her teaching , or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers . Uh-huh . When the , they decided that , that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre , uh , regime crimes as it were . Uh-huh . Being a child , you know . So , they kept on and on at , at her , and in the meantime , she and her husband , uh , were ex , ex , were expecting a child , their own child . And , uh , the , the people kept harassing her over , you know , over a period of months and finally they , uh , carried her , uh , out into the courtyard to , to , either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of , of shooting her , uh , with by firing , or , you know , executing her by firing squad . Uh-huh . And , uh , the Lord just said no , this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really , you know , she 's , she 's one of mine , she is not going to die and , uh , the , the soldiers were blinded when they shot . Huh . And she , her life was spared . And this , this frightened the , the , uh , the commandant and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp . Huh . Well , uh , and , course , here 's this , this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around . Huh . Well she , she put in for going , going to , uh , and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong , uh , and then she put in to go see him . And over time she , uh , uh , finally , through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the , the middle , uh , bureauc- , bureaucracy that they finally let her go . Huh . And , of course , she had to walk . You know , they , they stripped her of everything , practically besides the , the clothes on her back . And , uh , so she , so she went across the border to her husband and another , and other child that they 'd already had -- Uh-huh . -- uh , to freedom . Oh . And they knew that she was n't going to come back , but yeah , she did , years later when the , uh , liberalization , you know , in real life -- Uh-huh . -- liberalization of China happened , and , uh , she was not persecuted or anything else like that . Huh . Interesting story . Yes , it was . Uh , very moving , too . 

I , uh , I do n't even remember seeing that advertised and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly . Well , it was within , oh , ninety days . 

Oh . That recent . Yeah . No , I mean it 's , it was , it was advertised over a period of about ninety days . Oh , I see what you mean . But it was n't , uh , they did n't have it in , uh , too awfully many movie houses , but it was , it was , in the , it had large , uh , uh , uh , press release . Uh-huh . Well , uh , I guess what I , what I saw most recently and luckily I saw it only a week ago so I 'd remember -- Okay . -- remember it well was , uh , sort of light by comparison . Uh-huh . Uh , my husband and I had this great desire to go see a comedy and , and , uh , we ended up going to see GREEN CARD . GREEN CARD ? GREEN CARD . Uh-huh . And , uh , he chose it and , uh , it 's got this wonderful French actor who 's , it was his , like , his , and he 's been a star in France and a wonderful actor who we 've enjoyed for years , but he 's never made an American film . This was his American film debut -- Oh , I see , uh-huh . -- and he speaks very broken English . And basically he played , uh , a Frenchman who married an American girl , uh , in a marriage of convenience -- Uh-huh . -- so that he could get his green card , which is what an alien needs to work in this country . Right , uh-huh . 

And , uh , because she could claim she was married , she could get , uh , an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had a garden , an , an , an outside garden , which is very unusual there . Uh-huh . So she was a horticulturist , and that was sort of her dream . Oh , I see , uh-huh . Of course , you know , they got married and they never saw each other again . Except , except fate through them together and the Immigration and national- , Naturalization Service , uh , started investigating . So they had to get back together and get their stories straight , and , and she was a very svelte , sophisticated urban New Yorker -- Oh . -- and he was a , a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the , on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer , but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was . Uh-huh . He 'd been working in a restaurant when they met . Uh-huh . And , uh , they had to learn all about each other basically -- Just then . -- in a , in a weekend . And , uh , it was , you knew what was going to happen , of course . Uh-huh . That they would fall in love . Well , they fell into like , at any rate and -- Right , uh-huh . -- and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever , uh , they did perfectly and then he said something , because his English was so poor on , for the most part , he , he was so proud of himself for giving ex- , all the correct answers that , that on the last one he said , oh , I never remember that answer and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , uh ,
