Go ahead . Okay , do I still can , still can feel that the Soviet Union , as such , is still a threat to the civilized western world ? Absolutely . And my reasons are based upon not only from what I read in the newspapers , what I see on the newspapers , but up against some of the , fun and exciting things I ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group . 

Um . Okay . I guess I do n't see them as much of a threat as they used to be , but I think just the instability of the country right now is , sort of scary . Well , that 's what makes it a powder keg . The , um , I 'll go back in time a little bit , to about eighty-one , Uh-huh . when my first real involvement with the military started . Um , naturally we were at the time , the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat . So we got lots , quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons . Uh-huh . 

I went to Lebanon in eighty-three , before the marines ever got there , with the U N Peace Keeping Force . And with the training I received prior to going there , with captured weapons we kept running up against . These were n't , these were n't Chinese made copies . These were Soviet made , top of the line , fresh out of the box , A K forty-sevens . 

Um , uh-huh . As well as a lot of the explosives we were running into . In Granada , in October , twenty-fifth , eighty-three , we invaded the place . Sure there were Cuban soldiers there , but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots . The team I was with , we jumped in on the western tip of , of the island down on Point Salinas . And for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors . Huh . And they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons . In eighty-four , I was down in Central America , as an advisor to the Honduran Army . Again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit , plus Soviet advisors . And the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans , was brand new , out of the crate , Soviet made material . Do I consider them a threat ? Absolutely . They have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University . About like A and M or U T , where they 're teachings subjects like that , they 're teaching terrorism . Some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place . And let me tell you , they are nothing nice to go up against . Huh . I 'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we did n't have more incidents than they did . These guys are top of the line . When they , when they graduate from there , they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world . And they are very , very good at what they do . So until I see the entire , quote , old guard of the Soviet military , of the Soviet government completely roll over and disappear , preferably buried , I still consider them a threat . Uh-huh . Their military is different from ours , to where there are extremist gen- , generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops . That irregardless of what Soviet policy is , they 're going to do what the general tells them . Yeah . 

I guess that 's what concerns me the most . Is they 're , they 're so unstable that somebody like that could make , uh , decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people . Well , it 's in , interesting watching the different Soviet states , Albania , Lithuania , doing their little revolts down there . Uh-huh . Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there . So far they have n't run into the real psychos yet . There 's probably five or six , which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs , that are in positions over some of these Soviet states . If uprisings hap , happen in their sectors , it is , it 's going to be a total blood bath . Yeah , it looks like it 's come close to that as it is . Actually , they 're showing remarkable restraint . They get real nasty , the hyundee helicopters come out and they , would level entire areas . Okay , you 're from the Dallas area , right ? Uh-huh . Okay , you know , basically the size of , uh , the area around Richardson ? Yeah . You put five Soviet hyundee helicopters in the air , they can level the entire area and there wo n't be anything left alive . And they can do that in about four minutes . Huh . And they 've got entire squadrons of those just standing by . They used them in Afghanistan , did re- , remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in . But on a highly populated area , like some of the Soviet cities would be , with the weaponry that 's attached on those things , there is no place to hide . If the bombs do n't get you , if the bullets do n't get you , then , then the nerve gas definitely will get you . The only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time . They drink that much fuel . Uh-huh . Were you , have you , I take it you have n't spent any time in the military ? No , I have n't . As a civilian that 's never been attached to any form of the military , I know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in , never did make the newspapers . Uh-huh . But , during that same time frame , did n't you get some feeling , that , I mean , they 're getting all these weapons and stuff ? Did n't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff ? You mean in the , in the most recent conflict ? In any of them since eighty-one . Oh . Yeah , definitely . I , I 'm , I 'm a little bit shocked to what the U S has done in terms of selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years . Yeah , I think we , we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too . It 's bad enough that the Soviets do it . It all boils down to , whether it 's our side , their side , it 's a matter of money , Um . to a certain extent . Uh-huh . The deal the Iraqis have with the Russians was for oil . Yeah . 

It 's scary to know that they 're supplying that many people with weapons . Especially when it 's to the south of us . Uh , the ones to the south are more regional conflict . They 're not really that worried about invading north . They 're more interested in , they 've got a screwed up situation , I 'll give them that . From Mexico all the way down into Cen- , Central and South America . The situation down there is weird and it 's very screwed up . Uh-huh . Inflation is out of this world and the governments , which our government has technically supported for years , are corrupt as all get out . And generally the people , are getting screwed , and they 're tired of it , and they 're willing to try anything to get out from under it , even if that means going to communism . Yeah . Well , I think Russia is getting to the point where they 're , they 're about to do something to get out of communism . I guess I 'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power . I think Gorbachev has about had his day . Unfortunately , Yeltsin 's got too many connections with the old guard . That 's the only drawback that I see with the entire thing . Yeah . Gorbachev has made his attempt and he 's had his problems with some of the old guard himself . Uh-huh . Yeltsin 's in tight with the old guard . So it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils , Uh-huh . 

at this point . True . I do n't know , I sure would n't turn my back on them . You mean , 

I understand when they pulled the troops out of , uh , or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down , I thought that was great . But by no means do I endorse or approve pulling everybody out . Uh-huh . It may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there . But you still better have the key players in place , if something does go down . Even if it 's a regional conflict . If United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is , not only does it , it can talk the talk , but it 's got to be able to walk the walk . It 's got to have the stuff to back it , back up what it 's saying . If you 've only got a token force there , you ca n't hold your ground . 

At least they 're learning a little bit from history . I mean , uh ,
