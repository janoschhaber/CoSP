Are you a player ? Uh , I , I think I am . It 's , it 's been a while now . Has it ? Yeah , I 've , uh , oh , 

just recently I got married and we bought a house . We 're about fifty yards from the golf course -- Oh . -- but unfortunately the house is taking up my time . Yeah . So it 's been , uh , it 's been almost a year , I guess , since I 've actually , uh , swung a club for a purpose . Yeah , 

I hav , I have n't played in about two years , and then I went out two weeks ago with the guys here . I work at T I . Yeah . And I played in a tournament out there , and I shot a net fifty-nine . They were kind of , little upset . I guess I laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits . Yeah , yeah . I have a hard time inventing shots , you know . Let 's go around this tree , and -- Right . -- you know , try a slice through a hook here , and I ca n't do that so . Right . I finally got out , and I 've been watching quite a few videos . I had not been able to play so I took out a few videos and watched them for a while , and I , I hope I 'm on the right track . Yeah . Shot a career low eighty-nine , so , and my handicap is twenty nine . That 's , that 's great . I like that . Yeah . Now it 's , uh , like I say , it 's been a while for me , too . I , uh , I 've got my wife motivated about it , um -- Really . 

-- and , uh , I think that 's probably going to be one of the next investments , is get her , get her a set of clubs and , uh , we 'll get out of the driving range and , and get some interest built up and hopefully we can , uh , we can start in . Yeah , I 've tried to get my wife , I bought her a set of clubs four years ago . She has n't even swung them , but -- Really . -- she wants to get into it now after I came home and won the tournament the other day , she 's -- Well , great , great . That 's good , -- she 's ready to get off into it , 

but , you know , I like , I just like getting out , being in the outdoors , and I 'm a hunter and fisher anyway , but , you know . Yeah , same thing here . You know , at least I can get out and play a few hours of golf 

and it 's not going to cost me an arm and a leg , really . Right , right . And I , you know , I walk , I do n't ride so -- Uh-huh , yeah . -- you know , I get a little exercise there , too , so . 

That 's , I 've got the same attitude . I , uh , I tell you , I started , I guess , the first time I played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now , when I was in college . Yeah . And , uh , I took , uh , I took it as a P E course and then kind of left it alone for a while , and then finally got , got into it when I was , while I was still in school -- Right . -- and since then , uh , we 've made it , um , as , as the friends start getting married and things like that , we 've made a tradition of , uh , having a , a Thursday , um , well , have , have probably like , like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding . Yeah . And , uh , so , it , that 's back in South Dakota where I grew up -- Oh . -- and , uh , so that , that 's , uh , that 's been my main , my main involvement , is it seems like I go home and play golf more than I do around here , but , uh -- Yeah . -- eventually I get people to come and visit me in Dallas , and then I 'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we ca n't do it back home . Yeah , it 's pretty nice . We played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not . They were amazed . Yeah . You know , here it is , sixty-five degrees , we 're out playing golf , and they 're freezing cold back there , so . Yep , yep . But , I , uh , actually I picked it up when I was in high school , on the same as a P E course , you know , when I got into the service I got into it -- 

Oh , okay . -- and now when I come out here I just kind of let it go , and then one , one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if I played golf . And I said , Well , yeah , you know , I 've got my clubs , but I have n't swung them in quite a few years . Uh-huh . And then I got into it and then back out of it , and it just seems like every couple of years I get back in there . Yeah , that 's right . You know , I really enjoy it . It 's really nice . 

Oh , it is , it 's , it 's a lot of fun , especially if you can find somebody that 's , uh , that 's got the same level of interest . That seem to be the hardest -- Yeah . -- thing . Well , about , that 's , that 's true of any sport , you know . If you want to play tennis , or -- Yeah -- -- racquetball , -- you do n't want to go out and get beat to death , but . Right , 

and , and people do n't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time , you know -- No . -- and , and , uh , And then , you know , we 've got some guys here that they are , you know , four and five handicappers -- Uh-huh . -- and they do n't like to play with me because I 'm too slow for them , so . Right . You know , but get somebody around your own handicap , and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time . 

That 's right , yeah . And I 've , you know , I 've never , never yet have I walked up , now I 've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with , and never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that would n't allow me to join their twosome or threesome . That 's true . They are always friendly . That 's true . Sure , come on out , you know , and they do n't mind if you make a mistake , they do n't mind saying , Well , you know , let me tea , tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that , or , Well . You know , it 's , it 's pretty nice and friendly out there -- That , that 's , that 's so . -- and you ca n't find that in all sports . Yeah , that 's absolutely right , 

and you can gain a lot of ground doing that , too , if you , if , you know , you gets , you get in a rut if you do play a lot but you play with the same people , you , you are n't going to learn anything . Yeah , After a short period , once you learn everything they 've got to offer , then -- Yeah , you need to , 

-- you 've basically tapped your resources there . Yeah . But , uh , I 'd like to , uh , eventually I 'd like to work up , if , if my wife does get interested , and maybe get involved in a league in a , in a mixed , mixed doubles league , or something like that . Oh yeah , we MUMBLEx , we have one down here in the summertime . 

Uh , it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty -- Uh-huh . -- or eight o'clock , you know , because it does n't get dark until nine thirty or ten . Right . And we play in the summertime out here . We get a mixed league in , and that 's what I 'm trying to get her ready for . It 's going to start , well , when we change time back whenever that is -- Uh-huh . -- next month , I guess , and it will start then , and , you know , we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago , and they were just starting to learn , and , you know , they were shooting a hundred , hundred and twenty -- Sure . -- but they were , you know , now they 're down into the hundreds -- Right . -- nineties , so , it wo n't take her long . Well , that 's good -- You know , -- that 's good , that 's sounds like a lot of fun . And it 's something we can do together , so . Well , she does n't do much hunting , she could care less about that . Yeah . She 's does a little fishing , but , you know , golf would give her the exercise , she 'd be outside , give her something to do that we both enjoy , so . Yeah , it , it sounds like we 've got real similar situations . Yeah . I , I , I go home , uh , I 've gone home every year now since I 've moved to Dallas to , to go pheasant hunting , and , uh -- Uh-huh . -- um , the , the last time I , I took my wife along and , uh , k- , kind of the same situation . She 's , she 's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff , but , Yeah . She 'll definitely , uh , she 'll make the trip for fishing -- Yeah . -- if that comes along , but , uh -- 

All right . -- it 's , it 's interesting , Yeah , and it 's , you know , it 's a game that you do n't , like bowling , you know , you feel bad if you bowl a hundred . 

But if you shoot a hundred in golf , you know , you do n't have to be an expert to play , That 's right . Any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right . Uh-huh . So , you know , you do n't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all . That 's right , well , yeah , 

I 've , I 've kind of formed the attitude that , you know , if I could just , if I could pick two or three shots out , uh , out of my game every time and put them together on one hole , then I do pretty good -- Yeah . -- and then , and I keep , I keep rationalizing that well , you know , I can do it , I just got to do it all at th- , on the same hole , and , and then it will get better , and you just keep going , and in the meantime , just enjoy what you 're doing . Yeah . It , it , it really works that way . And when , you know when I first got back into it , I used to get mad because I knew I could do something and I did n't get it done . Uh-huh . You know , and I just , well , I need to slice this ball around here , 

I naturally slice anyway , now you know , the ball will go straight and I go Yeah . but , you know -- Yeah . -- I 'd get upset about it sometimes , and now I guess , you know , being in my forties , I just kind of mellowed out a little bit . Sure . I do n't get upset any more . So , and , Sure . And well , that 's great . Well , I 've enjoyed talking to you . Well , you bet . I guess I 'll go back to work . Okay , sounds like it . 

All right . See you later MUMBLEx . Okay . Bye-bye . Bye .
