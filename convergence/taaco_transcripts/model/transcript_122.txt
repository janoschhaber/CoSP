Well , have you ever served on a jury ? No , I 've not . I 've been called , but I had to beg off from the duty . And you ? 

Well , I was called and then I was not chosen . Um . Well , I was , I was , uh , originally chosen primarily , I think , because I was a young fellow 

and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict . I do n't know why . Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago . Oh , really ? Yeah , it 's that the younger they are , they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason , and they kind of liked me . I looked conser , and all that stuff and they , I do n't know what they saw in me , but they saw it . But , uh , back to the issue , is , uh , I do n't know , at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted , especially in cases in which there 's no smoking gun . But , there , too , there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable , particularly , I think in civil cases . In criminal cases , I 'd like to see the unani- , unanimity remain , but in civil cases , I think a majority rule by , by jury would be sufficient . Well , uh , could you give me an example of a case where you think that ? Well , in a criminal case , say one in which , you know , there is , like , say assault or some such . I think there ought to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this . And in civil law there , you know , is such a thing as like , let 's say , uh , misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that . A majority rule , I think , would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases . I do n't know if I 'm making any sense or not . Well , I mean , I think , 

are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more , uh , tangible or , Yeah , often there 's more incriminating evidence . Like , for instance , say , uh , and also , too , I think I 'm , I 'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more , uh , serious in a criminal case . 

Well , do you think that , that in a civil case , if there was majority rule , that it would be easy for someone to be set up ? Um , well , I really ca n't say for certain , truth be known . Uh , as it stands , there 's , there 's many ways and means by which a person can be set up , both , uh , in a civil , uh , civil and criminal case . I mean , the , uh , documentary , the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that . You know , I do n't know for , if you 're familiar with that or not . No , I 'm not . A , uh , fellow when he was much younger , uh , was tried and convicted and sentenced to death . Fortunately , in his case , the death penalty was revoked and , uh , so he served out his , his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system . 

The case was reopened and he was exonerated . Well , I mean , I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served . Yeah , many laws , but little justice . Say , but , uh , and I also think , just like you were talking about before , why you were chosen to be on a jury that , uh , the , just , the process of picking jurors is not always objective . Oh , certainly not , certainly not . 

And , you know , they like to think that they 're getting someone who 's objective in all this , but they 're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers ' desires . You know , the , because you get up and , and they ask you a few questions , both sides do , and then you , you 're either challenged which is , you know , each attorney can use that as much as they like or , I think it 's a limit now , they probably have a limit now , but , they pretty much go through that , and then you have to give a reason to the court why you ca n't serve . For me , it was financial hardship , so . But , onto the thing , uh , I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing . It was always my impression that the Justice himself , or herself , had the final say .
