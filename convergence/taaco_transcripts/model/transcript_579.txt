So . Have you heard about Saturns ? I 've heard some about Saturns . I do n't know a lot about them . I have n't been over , uh , to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight 's paper that said that their , uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the , I guess , the Japanese cars . Ooh , that 's great . Actually that 's kind of the type of car that I , I 'm thinking about we might get . Saturns , you ca n't go to a dealer unless you go to a , a Saturn dealer . This , this offshoot of G M . Yeah . And , uh , supposedly , they 've got great customer satisfaction from what things I 've heard . 

Um . Yeah , I 've heard a lot of people like them . Uh , yet I do n't know wh- , whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point . I 'm kind of , my card and , uh , desires tend to be pretty picky and so , uh . Well , like what ? Well , let 's see . I li , I like cars that are designed with , with human beings in mind , and that 's not just the driver and the passenger but that 's the person who 's working on it , cause I do al- , almost all my own maintenance and , uh -- Uh-huh . -- those types of things . And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in , uh , finding a ca- , car anymore that 's , that 's fairly easy for me to work on , it 's just not very eas , it 's not very , almost unlikely at this point . Yeah . And , uh , yo- , Yeah . 

I 've got a sixty-five Mustang and -- Ooh . -- I , and I do the work on , most of the work on that myself . Uh-huh . And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that , I just say I will never do that with the modern cars . It 's not worth my time . You ca n't get in there . You ca n't do anything . Yeah . And it 's so complicated too . I look at it and I say , boy , you know , I , I 'd have to almost go take a class or something like that . Well I 've got an eighty-three Saab . Uh-huh . 

And I find that for a normal , you know , everyday things . It 's really very easy to work on and so , uh , you know , I 'm kind of spoiled . I used to have a MUMBLEx Chevy . Uh-huh . With a three fifty in it . Yeah . And , uh , I really liked working on it . Uh , cause it was pretty easy too . It was about a nineteen seventy . So I 'm kind of , uh , biased in that and , you know , I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore . Yeah . And that 's kind of , that 's , that 's probably one thing I 'd look at . I think another thing I 'd look at is safety . Yeah . That 's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about . Actually , the car , one of the cars we 'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they 're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual -- Huh . 

-- side air bags . That 's a real nice car , I think . Yeah . I 've driven some , uh , Tauruses over the last couple of years when I 've been on business trips . Uh-huh . Uh , as rental cars . And I 've always been very impressed with the Taurus . It 's a really nice car . I think it 's very , it 's a stylish car both inside and out . It 's comfortable to drive . Uh , reasonable performance , and this is out in California where , where they do n't make a car that 's got reasonable performance anymore . Yeah . Uh , I 've been real impressed with that . Yo- , and I did n't realize that they were putting dual , uh , air bags in that car now . Ninety , yeah . Or , excuse me , the ninety-twos . The -- Uh-huh . -- ninety-twos had dual air bags . This newest model . You could -- Oh , I think that , -- get them with duals . That 's excellent . 

That 's excellent because , Yeah . But the thing is that it 's twenty thousand dollars . Actually , my , my wife and I are actually thinking , contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so . So we 're actually -- Oh . -- been looking around and thinking about things . We 'd like to get like a oh , I do n't know . What do you call it ? A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know . Uh-huh . Year old ninety-two or something like that . Uh-huh . Sure . Those are -- See if we , -- yeah , 

that , that would be a good deal to go with . And the other thing we 're looking at is the Saturns too . Okay . Because they looked really nice . Uh-huh . What do you , what do you looking for in , in those ? What , what attracts you to the Saturns ? Or , or , of course , we 've already talked , you know , the Taurus is safe . But wh , what kind of things are you looking for ? Well , the Saturns you can get air bags in them . I do n't think you can get dual side air bags . Uh-huh . But one of the , the two things that I 'm really , 

the , the I 'd say the most important thing is a car that 's not going to fall apart . That does n't have problems . Uh-huh . You set down . You look at consumer reports . We 've been pouring over consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the U S auto -- Yeah . -- makers when you do that . Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have and , and the two cars that apparently are close to that . That actually have high reliability , the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars . Uh-huh . And the other one is , are the Saturns . Uh-huh . So those two things . And then , you know , we kind of want a four door . Okay .
