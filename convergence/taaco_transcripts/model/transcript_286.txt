Well , this is the season for vacations . And , uh , I guess for places I like to go , I enjoy going to the beach and having , having outdoor , being outdoors somewhere . Someplace that 's very different than Texas . Right . And I , as far as , maybe , maybe as the summer heat comes along I would sort of like going somewhere where it 's not so hot . And being able to be outside , enjoy outsor , outside activities , so . Yeah . Enjoy going places where , I enjoy playing tennis , so I like to have a tennis court there , or , or if it 's at the beach , the beach is great . A pool is great . And , I , Where , where do you usually go ? Oh , well , let 's see , we have plans this year to drive up to the , uh , to Colorado . Uh-huh . And , we will be going to Estes Park , and Colorado Springs , so . Uh-huh . One year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado , into Durango and north of the area there . Uh-huh . And I , boy that 's a nice , a nice place to visit . It 's really nice at , there 's a nice , nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining . Right . And , uh , and then actually , north , north of that is another town and , a smaller , on a smaller scale , I guess , than Silverton . But , I , and then there 's lots and lots of real , of mountains that are covered with , uh , boulders . Uh-huh . So , I guess people Jeep through that area and we did not have a chance to do that . But , I sure would like to go back there and do that again . Right . We are , uh , we have not had a vacation in several years , so , be our first chance in awhile , uh , 

we are going to go to , uh , Destin , Florida , which is a very nice beach area , if you are not familiar with it . I have not been , but I have heard it 's wonderful . Oh , it 's , it 's gorgeous . Uh , we used to go quite a bit , uh , before I moved out here . We were closer and , uh , used to go almost every summer , uh , and , rent a condo there on the beach . Uh , there 's quite a few , uh , there 's a lot of development of , of condominiums there on the beach front . Right . And , uh , so they have , uh , they are very , very large condos . And , they have quite a few rooms , and , uh , so we , we will usually rent one for about a week or so . And , Right , and the , go down . beach is nice , Oh . 

the beach is really nice , is n't it . Yes , it 's , uh , it 's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water , and a , Oh . lot of nice waves usually , uh , 

Sea shells . enough , enough to make it . I am sorry . Sea shells . Uh , there 's not as many sea shells along there , uh , that 's the only thing that they really do not , they have some , but not , not so much . Yeah . Um , if you go further down , uh , you will usually find some , but not right in there . Uh , I do not know why it is , but , uh , it just , it seems not , it seems not to have as many there , right there . But , uh , we , we enjoy it , uh , it 's , the place where we stay is , we usually stay at the same place every year , and they are , like I say right on the beach . So , Oh , where do you stay ? My husband always wants to go to Destin , we just have not gone that direction yet . 

It 's a place called Jetty East , uh , J E T T Y E A S T , and it 's , uh , called that because it 's at the very end of , uh , a jetty there , which is , Okay . uh , sort of at the end of this little , little point and , uh , it 's a , at the very end , it 's the last set of condominiums there , and it 's , uh , it 's very nice . Uh , it 's not very expensive , uh , you can , I think we are going to go with another couple and their kids . And , uh , they have a , we have a , uh , I think it 's three bedroom or two bedroom , uh , condominium , which will sleep , I do not know , quite a few about , Right . six or eight . And , uh , cause it 's got , you know , pull out couches and all that , and , uh , I think it 's going to cost us , per couple , about three hundred dollars for the week . Oh . That 's nice . Yeah , it really is , because , uh , the , uh , you know , it has got its own kitchen , full size , Great . kitchen and everything . And , this one , I think has two baths , and it 's , the one we got is on the , on the beach side . So , Oh , nice . We have got a beautiful view and balcony , and , uh , just , you know , it 's really a nice stay . Uh , in fact , we stayed there on our honeymoon , we , I had won a trip to the Bahamas , but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time , so we instead went there , uh , and loved it just as much as , as if we had gone to the Bahamas . We , Oh . in fact , we stayed an extra day or so , because we liked the , uh , the particular ro- , uh , uh , uh , suite we had gotten was very nice and , Great . so we decided to stay . Oh . But , uh , it 's a pretty nice place , you will need to try to go and , Well , we have just -- stay there sometime . -- we have just , It 's a little far from here , but , uh , Are you driving ? Yeah , we are . We are , it will take , uh , a day and a half to get there , probably . Oh . So . Well , we are , the neighborhood that we live , they are switching to an alternate calendar this year , so it , starting , well , starting at the end of July , we will have two vacation weeks in October and two vacation weeks in March . Uh-huh . So that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family . So , I , Uh , what does , what does that mean , alternate ? Well , it 's , what it truly is supposed to mean is nine weeks of school , three weeks of vacation , Oh . nine weeks of school , three weeks of vacation . Uh-huh . And , uh , in , and in the summer would be more like a two month , two month break . Right . So , and they hope to boost the , they hope to boost the learning of the children . 

I see . Just the retention of the material for them . So , uh , Kind of scattering the vacation out , throughout the year . Yeah , Yeah . yeah . So , it 's 

so , anyway , so maybe , maybe within a year , we will see how that falls . Right . We will head for , we will head for Florida , maybe in somewhat of an off season , instead of summer . Right . So , uh . Okay . Well , that 's probably ne- , all we need to do today . Okay . Alright . So long . Thanks a lot . Bye-bye .
