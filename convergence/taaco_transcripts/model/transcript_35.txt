Uh , the last movie that I saw , I , I do n't go to that many so I 'll just have to talk about the ones that I went to see , but , Okay . uh , it was AWAKENINGS with , uh , Robin Williams and , uh , Peter DeNiro . Yes , uh-huh . Have you seen it . No unfortunately I have n't , 

I heard it 's really good , but . It is . I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro . Uh-huh . He is one of the best actors I 've ever seen . It 's , there 's a point where , the , uh , the show is about these , uh , catatonic type people that , this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the , the living , more or less , but it wears off . Uh-huh . And the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic , you know , uh , it starts off with like a tic , Uh-huh . and then it gets to where he ca n't , you know , control his movements at all . And it was just so realistic . The way , you know , you have to just keep reminding yourself that he 's an actor . Uh-huh . What does , uh , is Robby , Robin Williams , does he have a funny part in it ? No , it was very serious , very se , 

Oh how does he do serious . He 's good , he 's , he 's talented , boy , he is . I 've only seen him in funny stuff 

and so . I know , me too . But , uh , well , what was that show , um , Gar- , uh , Garf- , I want to say Garfield but that was n't it . Yeah , uh , GARP , THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP . Yeah , THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP . He was n't always funny in that show , was he . I did n't read , see the , the movie , I read the book but I , I did too . 

That 's why I was thinking it could n't be just a totally funny part . Yeah , in fact , it got some pretty serious deep parts in it so . Yeah , right . Yeah . Well what have you seen ? I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES . Oh , I saw it . Good , we 've both seen one . Did you cry through it ? Yes , the whole way . It was telling a friend , I , I said , I only cried twice , but each was about half an hour long , so . Where did you cry . Um , let 's see , when I , each time that I thought that the Indians were going to get killed , I cried . Uh-huh . Um , I cried the first time when the , um , the wagon man got killed , when they attacked him . Uh-huh , yeah , yeah . And , uh , I think from there on , all the way through the movie . Let 's see what else did it . Um , what other parts . I ca n't remember any of the other parts right off now . 

I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed . We- , I do n't remember when the horse got killed . Oh , th- , when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him . 

Oh , yeah . And then he , uh , the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards , you know . Uh-huh . And that horse has been such a pal to him , Yeah . when he was alone . You can tell I 'm an animal lover , you can hear my dog . Unfortunately we do n't have any animals , so , uh . Yeah . It was a beautiful story , it really was . It , 

there was a lot of pretty scenery , too , in that movie . Uh-huh , uh-huh . What did you think about the buffalo scenes . Oh , I thought it was awful , That was , and so graphic , Yeah . 

I mean I had n't even imagined it , you know . I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo . Uh-huh . Um , I had a friend who had fixed some , uh , chili , buffalo chili and , about a week before went to see the movie . Oh , oh . Of course they raise them now , you know , to eat . Uh-huh , yeah , it 's not , But she , we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that . Uh-huh , well at least you know that it was n't same situation that the buffalo died in . No 

it was n't . Um , I thought the scenes when the buffalos running , though , were beautiful , like that was great . Oh , yeah . And there were so many of them . I did n't know that , that many buffaloes alive , much less in one place . Yeah , really . So that was pretty . 

And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape , you know , you could follow this , this beaten down path , Yeah . and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing . I wonder how they kept up with them , though , it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast . 

I know . I guess they graze , though , that would n't be a problem . Yeah , yeah . Uh , have you seen any of the behind the scenes , uh , of , of that movie . No , huh-uh . It was , 

they tried to keep it , you know , as very close to real . Uh-huh . I mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes and , uh , they had to teach a wolf how to , to howl . Oh . That 's the , part they had trouble finding was wolves . 

I guess they 're just not domesticated , or , or , Yeah , what , they just do n't howl that much anymore . I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off and that 's all they 'd have to do . Yeah . 

Well that 's funny . Well , I think we 've made it . Oh is that five minutes , is that , I do n't know , is it five or three . Okay , oh , I 'm not sure . I 'm not either . Okay , 

well I think we 're , we 're , we 've done okay , though . Okay , me too . Well thank you for calling . Well thank you . And I hope you enjoy some more good movies late- , Yeah , you too . Bye , bye . Bye , bye .
