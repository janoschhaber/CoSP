Hi , my last , uh , auto repair was my , my , uh , alternator went out . I have a nineteen eighty-six Toyota , uh , it 's a little Tercel . Uh-huh . And , uh , I have a fri- , a friend who 's real good with , uh , repairing cars so I got him to take the alternator off and take it and , uh , you know , get a replacement part . Uh-huh . So we went to a , uh , a , a place called Quality Auto Parts an , and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and , and everything and they 're , they 're , uh , very reasonable . So , uh , I bought the alternator , we p , put it on the car and it , it did n't work , and it blew out all the fuses . Oh , no . Yeah . 

How much was the alternator ? Uh , I bel- , something like sixty-nine dollars , som- , something on that order . Did he , did he hook up the wir- , wiring wrong ? No , 

he hooked it up right . It , it was just that the , the part just , just did n't fit the car , so . I took it back and , uh , he , he took the alter- , the guy in , in the parts shop took the alternator and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them and , uh , he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator so we , we went back and tried it again , put it on again and it still did n't work , and we took the car up to , um , a little place called Pep Boys , I do n't know if you have them in your area -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , they 're , they 're pretty reasonable , uh , car repair place also . So , uh , took it up there , towed it up there because it , you know , would n't start or anything and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and , uh , took them about an , an hour to , um , figure out what was , what was blowing the fuse , and it was , it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse . Anyway , ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer and the only problem was that , uh , it had to be a genuine Toyota , uh , alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it , that , that , you know , they sit in there and everything but there 's just some little difference that , um , causes it not to work an i- , Uh-huh , they probably built that in so they could make money . 

Ye- , yeah , I guess so and that was my , that was my last experience . Well I had a weird , 

there 's a little sensing device , uh , in front of my , uh , um , I 'm not sure , right in front of the f- , fan , it 's a , it 's an air conditioner sensing device . I do n't know why , it actually , there 's a metal piece that fits through the belts , uh , and somehow that broke off and , uh , I , I still ca n't figure out how it broke , and , uh , anyway , so a- , this piece obviously , um , I have a Subaru , and , uh , I think you can only get it through Subaru dealer , etcetera , so . Uh-huh . Uh , this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks . Goodness , are you able , 

And , and I have n't had too many problems with my car , I got a eighty-eight Subaru , G L X T and it , Uh-huh . uh , and then , you know just basic maintenance and oil changes an I , and I do not do my oil changes and I will not do my oil changes . I 've , I think the first time I tried to do one and ended up , um , trying to ge- , uh , yo- , borrowed somebody else 's jack and I did this and I went and bought everything , Uh-huh . so after buying the filter and all the oil , you 're looking at ten bucks at least , Uh-huh . or somewhere in there an , and , uh , and then to go to the trouble , that I figured it 's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube . Yeah . So that , that 's , um , you know , as far as any maintenance on my car , I , I shy away from the oil changes , that 's for sure . Uh-huh , well my car is , uh , it 's an eighty-six 

and I really had n't had any , any trouble with it un- , until that and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it and , uh , and this was just recent , so I really ca n't complain about this one . How did you put that many miles on it , in , Um , well , I used , four or five years ? I used to work , uh , it was a seventy mile trip everyday , you know , two ways was seventy miles . Oh , a hundred and forty mile trip ? No , it was , it was just seventy miles . Oh , thirty-five miles each way . Yeah . Yeah . 

And , uh , I did that for about three years and it really , it really added up . I 've only taken , uh , maybe two trips that were about four hours long dow- , uh , down to Shreveport . And , uh , the rest of it was , you know , it 's just basically driving a long ways to work . And now I drive like twenty , twenty-three miles each way , so , I 'm getting a little , a little , uh , little relief , but still I drive a long ways . Yeah . But I guess because they 're highway miles , you know , it 's not so bad on your car as , as if it , you know , were just regular street , you know . Uh-huh . Do you work for T I ? Yes 

I do . Okay . Do you ? I was going to ask you , you know , as far as how we 're getting compensated for what we 're doing right now , um , I do n't work for T I and I 'm just , I get these green , I do n't know what you want to call them , fake -- Points . -- point things , Uh-huh . and , uh , I just wondering how I go about getting the cash . Uh , there 's a number that you call , it 's the same number that you , that you call to make a call . 

Oh , okay . You , you call that number and , and , uh , somehow or another they 'll give you an option to leave a message and you can leave a message . Okay . I know someone that did that , you leave a message and they 'll , they 'll call you back . Okay , 

all right , well that 's good to know . I have n't been doing th- , this is the first time I 've been called in a long time and I have n't been doing it so , Oh really . And , uh , I 've done it maybe twelve times . Uh-huh . Well I do n't know if I 've done it quite that much , but , uh , mine is mixed up too , I have to call and get it fixed . Uh , let 's see before I had this car I had a , um , I bought an Audi five thousand -- Uh-huh . -- but I bought it , I bought it used . 

I , I just bought it from a friend who was going to , who just charged me what the dealer was going to give , give him for it for a trade-in , and , uh , it had a whole lot of miles on it . I , I figured maybe I 'd get one or two years out of it , an I , an I did get a couple of good years out of it and the , uh , the engine messed up on me and then I gave it to a guy to repair who works for the aut- , for the Audi dealer and , uh , he took the engine apart and , you know , he just said he could n't fix it so the engine never got put back together again . Huh , oh well . I , 

I was driving a sixty-six Plymouth Fury . Wow . I think those old cars -- Yeah , yeah , and , -- might , might be a pretty good bet because you , I do n't know , i- , Oh , tha- , that 's when they made cars , though , this things was , the body was in good condition and MUMBLEx you know , it ran fine . 

It was starting to burn some oil . Uh-huh . Um . And , um , but I had to , you know , ge- , you know , I , MUMBLEx after about thr- , couple of months after I was out of college I finally splurged and bought my car so . Uh-huh , I read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy-four . Yeah , well , you know , these , these cars made in the sixties and stuff , I mean the steel , I mean , the thickness , I mean , i- , those thin- , they 're just , th- , you just do n't see cars like that . Uh-huh . And they last a long time . And they were simple too , the engines were simple and durable and -- Yeah . -- some people will still buy them , you know , they 'll , Yeah , it 's easy to , it 's easy , I guess it 's still easy to find engines for those cars , engines and transmissions and if you , I guess if you keep trad- , changing them out you can keep a car for a long time . Course I guess I could do the same thing with the , the Toyota that I have , I just do n't know how much they 'll want to charge me to , It almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it , you 're just better off buying another car . Yeah , 

I guess so , but I just think they cost too much in the , in the first place , now a days .
