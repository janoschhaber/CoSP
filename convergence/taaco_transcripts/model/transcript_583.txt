So , do you , your privacy being invaded at any time ? Well , uh , one of the things that , uh , that I found to be , uh , an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the , on the , uh , credit card bill . That -- Well , yo- , -- is something that is not required -- Right . 

-- and , in fact , uh , it is actually prohibited but it does n't stop many people many people from , uh , from doing it . And it 's n- , o- , one of the things that it 's used for , primarily , is for demographic , uh , research . And to get th- , your , your phone number on , uh , uh , lists for phone solicitations . Yeah . Yeah . Now th- , that y- , s- , you can still , yeah , I 've always done that . I started , once I found out that that 's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse and I say what are you going to do . You going to say you do n't want to sell me this product then -- Uh-huh . 

-- that 's fine . I 'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all . And then , ultimately , they say , no you do n't have to put it down . But , uh , really it 's part of this compliance thing . Uh-huh . Uh , the thing I do n't like , I know that certain states actually sell their , uh , their lists like , uh , motor vehicles . Uh-huh . That really burns me because , hey , you 're required . You have to do that . Right . And nowhere does it say you h , asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone . Uh-huh . And I think that , it , it 's one thing f- , to , uh , voluntarily give it because someone asks . You can always refuse but it 's another thing where it 's required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody . Right . Uh , That , 

You know , I do n't think , I do n't think they have the right to do that . I agree with you there . That 's something that , uh , people have seen . Oh , here 's an easy way to make some money . But , uh , I do n't know if that 's been challenged in the courts or not . I , I 've heard , fairly recently , uh , some talk about that in this , in , in my state . Uh , the budget problems up here are , are pretty tense . And people are looking for alternate ways of , uh , en , enhancing revenue is the , uh , phrase they use . 

And they were talking about selling the D M V lists and there was a lot of , uh , a lot of , uh , consternation about that and the last I heard they 'd backed down from that idea . But it really makes you wonder what other lists you 're own that have been made , uh , public that you , do n't know about . Well , that 's easy . Whenever you donate money to someone ? Uh-huh . They , you become , put on something like a sucker list and you start getting millions of calls or -- Right . -- solicitations . And then you s , y- , y- , it kind of makes you feel MUMBLEx from doing it again . Uh-huh . Like , uh , National Public Radio or any of these , the public , uh , stations , you know . Uh-huh . I , I , I , I think I sent in , in money for , f- , once to , uh , to public , uh , T V . Uh-huh . And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and -- Huh . -- everything you could imagine . I , it 's like , and it just started soon after I had done that one . Right . And I just said this is , this is terrible . Uh , and that 's also happened to me where I 've given money to my old Alma Mater in college . Uh-huh . And , uh , it 's one thing , they do n't sell the list . But the thing that makes me mad is , uh , then they start getting , uh , other people , th- , the people do these phonathons -- Right . -- and they call you up and they actually happen to be people who are , graduated in your class or something like that . And , and they say , oh , we , we know you . You , uh , had , uh , contributed x amount last year . Can you do better this year ? And , you know , like hold on here . How do you know that ? Who , how do you know that ? Why , why you even telling me this ? Is it any of your business ? I mean , it 's one thing that I , and the college knows that that 's , 

just our business . There 's no need for someone -- Uh-huh . -- who is soliciting should know at all . Just , uh , and that was very offensive too . I , and so , Last year , the , uh , Lotus Development Company , the , uh -- Uh-huh . -- company that puts out One , Two , Three -- Right . -- was planning on marketing a , uh , C D Rom with people 's names sorted by number of different criteria .
