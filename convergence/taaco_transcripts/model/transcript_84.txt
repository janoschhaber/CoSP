Okay , do you want to go first ? Well , I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic . Fitness and exercise . Oh , God . No , why do n't you go first . Okay , 

um , I like to do , uh , weight training and , and cycling . And just walking , uh , swimming . I used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall . And the doctor said that running and jumping is n't real good for my knee anymore , so I had to kind of change my life-style a little bit . Well , let me ask a personal question , how old are you ? Thirty-eight . Oh , well then you should see over thirty-five everything goes downhill flop . Well , the rest of me is in pretty good shape it 's just that left knee that just does n't want to do everything it used to . Oh , you 're lucky then because I 've battled arthritis all my life , Really ? I mean even since I was like about two or three . Oh . Then they diagnosed it , and usually most people are just absolutely crippled , and , uh , I do water aerobics . Oh , I bet that helps . Religiously do water aerobics , Uh-huh . 

I used to do it about six times a week and now I 'm down to about four but it 's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in sh- , in there , uh , I tried weight training and I 'm telling you , you just , I just ca n't lift the things . Yeah . And the shock on the system is , is just too much , so I have stuck to water aerobics basically , you know , the weightless thing and , Yeah . trying to keep this shape that way but , you know , it 's hard to find . I mean it 's really hard to find a place that 's going to offer water aerobics because what I 'm finding is that if they do offer it , you get the crowd of women that are , , I think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way , That 's right . to get in shape , That 's right . without having to spend anything or it 's the geriatric crowd . That 's right . So , I 've considered even becoming licensed to teach it . Well , I mean , if , if you know what your routine is , you can do that by yourself , and you probably do . Yeah , but you have to have an indoor pool . This is true . So , to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without , you know , drawing a lot of looks , means you 're really going to do a strenuous workout activity MUMBLEx you look very odd in the water , Well , that , that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training , and that does look very odd in the water . I can believe that . Have you tried the , uh , the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center ? No , and you know , that 's the only place I have n't tried 

and people have told me . Now that 's the Texins facility ? Yes . I have been told that thing is just lovely . It is . They keep it at eighty-one degrees year-round . Huh . He- , 

do you use that facility a lot ? Um , a fairly , a fairly good amount , uh , more on the weekends , uh , I try to beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings , I try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center . Huh . Do you know if they have child care there ? Um , have you done your attitude survey for this year yet ? You need to put that on there , seriously . They do n't , 

I do n't , I do n't work at T I . Oh , you do n't ? No , I used to work at T I , Oh . as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position actually when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry , and I used to fill out those attitude surveys , Yeah . and , uh , uh , me and the insurance adjusters are , are very familiar with each other and my husband still works there , Yeah . and , um , I get my attitude expressed through them , but I find it to be very sometimes it 's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short- , MUMBLEx mentality to save a few bucks . This is true . Uh , and never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I and I came down here and , you know , they did an attitude survey like six weeks after I had been working here and I asked about , you know , day care for the shift workers , Yeah . and boy I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just do n't say that , you know , Well , it 's not , it was not applicable to me and I was kind of horrified . Now what year are we talking about ? We 're talking nineteen seventy-eight . Okay , 

uh , things have become much more enlightened since then . They could n't have gotten anymore in the dark ages . Yeah , you know , we still do n't have a day care facility 

but people are more sympathetic to it . I understand , I understand that they 're now covering women 's preventative health care , Yes . Yes . and , uh , the reason I 'm at home is when I had my kids , and I was scheduled to go back and I tell you how much in the dark ages it was . Um , I had been rated number one in the field and then I took , uh , when I became pregnant I also got meningitis , Oh . and then delivered the first baby three months early , My gosh . and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home , and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment . Could you hold the phone for one second , Sure . Thanks . Okay , I 'm back . And then they used to , uh , and then I had a second one eighteen months later , they told me to put them back to back and , of course , to maintain and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one , Wow . because that 's when I go into labor MUMBLEx four and a half months and I do n't even know it . Of course it 's real easy to take care of the first one when you 're on your back . 

Oh , yeah , very easy , very easy and they , they put me on twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then to , to try to control the labor and see how far it was going , and after the baby was born , since it was n't premature , then they said they would n't cover the cost of the monitor . I think that 's kind of when my husband hit the roof , Really . because it was a , uh , thirteen thousand dollar bill , but after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work , Yeah . and that was when they had , God it would have been the eighty-five layoff , Yeah . and I 'll tell you how they handled this and I was just outraged , I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been , uh , terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months later and they did n't have any coverage under my name and I went back and I said what the hell is going on here , you know . Yeah , really . And they told me that , uh , oh , well , you know , you know , your husband works here and he 's got a good salary we did n't think that you 'd be coming back anyway , and , uh , you know , we 've got people here that really , you know , need to be working and so that we had just , you know , it was , this way we did n't have to layoff an active person and we 'd just let you go . And it took me about a year of arguing , I said , you know , I 've got to put this in writing to me , Yeah . and because until they put it in writing , I could n't get my insurance benefits and I could n't get my , uh , termination benefits either . There you go . I was just pissed as hell that they could do that . I , I can believe that . But I , I guess things have gotten better , I 've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things , Oh , yeah , flex time is great . I still do n't think that , they after my experiences that they could , you know , get me to go back , ever again . I , I can understand . I can understand . Well , it 's been good talking with you . But let me ask you this , since you use Texans , how much is it a month ? Oh , shoot it 's only about ten bucks a month . Now that 's for individual . Yeah , I mean , uh , to add dependents is , is you know , maybe another dollar or something it 's no big deal . That 's it ? Yeah . Now if you , if you pay your monthly charge , do you then pay separately for classes you 're taking ? Uh , you do for classes , for classes , but to , I mean to use any of the facilities is , is no extra charge . God , that 's cheap . Yeah , it is . That 's really cheap . Do you have to be an active T I employee to join Texans or , Or , or a depe- , or a dependent of one . Or a depe- , 

God , I am so dependent these days . Really . It 's a sense MUMBLEx . Oh , MUMBLEx seen that my , my co-dependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbor 's fence . Wonderful . Yeah . So my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment but boy , I think I 'm going to go contact Texans . I really think I am , Yeah . I mean , that beats any offer I 've heard in a long time . Oh , yeah , it 's great . Huh . 

All righty . When you 're there on weekends is it crowded as hell ? Uh , well , it would depend on when you go 

it 's not , it 's not excessively crowded on the weekends . See I 'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty . Oh , I do n't think that would be bad at all . If you 're in Richardson you 'd probably wanted to come to the , to the Dallas site . Oh , I 'm actually right on the Plano line . Oh , well , then you could go either one , Yeah . the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern , has a lot more niceties , amenities and you 'd probably like the pool there . 

Oh , God it sounds like I would . I might do that then . Okay , I learned something here . Well , good . I 'm glad . You can go back to work now . Well , thank you . Thank you . 

You have a good day . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
