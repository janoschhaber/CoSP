So , how you like New Jersey ? Uh , it 's pretty good , you know . You get , uh , closer to the , uh , coast here , and you do get a good bit of , uh , smog and stuff , especially from all the , uh , fuel cracking towers and chemical plants . Right , 

I guess , uh , I do n't know what part of New Jersey you 're in , but I guess it 's , uh , fairly industrial ? Yeah , it 's , when you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial -- Right , uh-huh . -- but I 'm , I 'm about , uh , thirty miles west of there so you have , uh , actually green trees and such that you -- Yeah . -- do n't notice that , that other part of -- Yeah . -- New Jersey exists . Right . Actually very , 

Y- , you know , you go even a few wi- , miles out and you got , uh , farms and everything so you , relatively clear air . Right . But , uh , Well , I do n't know about you , but I 've always considered automobiles to be , probably the , the prime contributor . I mean there 's a lot of contributors , but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that . 

Oh , d- , definitely . It 's -- Yeah . -- uh , you know , there are a large number of them on the road . They 're all , you know , going , and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair . That 's , yeah , that 's , that 's a big issue is , you know , 

a lot of states do n't have a , uh , inspection law so you get , you get a lot of people out there without E T R , emission control systems on their cars and things like that . Oh , e- , even where you do have the inspections , you know , the inspection is once a year . Yeah , and it 's like , 

You get the car that 's in the accident and muffler falls off or something -- Sure . -- and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that . Right . I guess , from what I hear , though , uh , next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars . They 're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California . Yeah , that , 

and I think also some of the , uh , car companies are coming out with , uh , gas powered fleets -- Yeah . -- so you , natural gas powered rather than , uh , gasoline . Right . I hope , I , I 'm hoping that comes along quick . Uh , I was reading a , an article in TIME the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that 's going and I guess it 's , it 's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize and I know that 's not due to , uh , it 's not due to , to gasoline or to , you know , carbon monoxide so much as the C F C -s but , It , it is coming from cars , though . 

Uh , yeah , I think that 's a , that 's a contributor definitely . I mean , the , uh , car air conditioners is -- Right . 

-- one of the major leaking sources of , uh , the , uh , freon . Right . Which is one of the major flor- , chlorofar- , fluorocarbons . Yeah , I guess right now what they 're , what they 're primarily worried about is third world countries because I guess United States and , and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating C F C production , but -- Well , it , it , -- it , go ahead . No , 

it 's , it 's the type of thing there that , uh , you know , the Third World countries are less industrial and they want to become industrial -- Uh-huh . -- so they 're on the different part of the cycle of the U S . The U S used , you know , all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today . Right . And that 's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is , that basically they do n't want to have to pay for our mistakes if , if that makes any sense . Uh , in terms of , Or , or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way , where we -- Exactly . -- got to . Exactly . Uh , those of kind of , yeah , those are joining arguments , but , uh , I do n't know , that 's , that 's kind of an interesting situation there . Uh , what they do n't realize , those third world countries , what they do n't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting . I guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the Poles and it 's , it 's increasing even as far near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places . Yeah . So it 's kind of an interesting situation . It 's not , not a real good one actually . No . But , Well , you also have the very close related thing of the , uh , rain forest destruction -- Yeah . -- which is the main source of what 's clearing out the atmosphere and -- Uh-huh , yeah . -- replacing some of the pollutants . Yeah , you do n't get that , that source of cleansing anymore . Are , have you been in big cities a long time ? Mostly , I 've mostly been in the east coast , so that 's going between Atlanta , Washing- , D C area , Okay , so you 've got , A- , Yeah , those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard , I would think . Well , not , not as hard as some places out west because you do n't get the , uh , major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the -- Yeah , Denver 's definitely -- -- inversion -- -- yeah , that 's one of the worst . -- and Los Angeles and a- , rest of California which is just terrible it sounds . Sure . Yeah , Denver 's that , that real good e- , that real good , uh , example of sitting in a valley , kind of like Mexico City does , I guess . Uh-huh . Mexico City is historically been one of the worst -- Yeah . -- in the , in the world for that . But I 've been pretty lucky , I 've lived in cities that really have n't had that much of a problem , although , uh , I 'm really kind of based in Orlando , Florida and there , you can tell that it 's getting worse . I mean , it , it definitely it 's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver but you can , Yeah , there , it 's almost all automobiles because there 's not that much in the way of -- Exactly . -- heavy industry , you know , that would be causing it . Yeah . And there 's not that much in terms of , of public transportation down there . Uh-huh . There is , but it 's kind of it 's ,
