Okay , um , let 's see . How do you feel about credit cards ? Personally , I do not care for them . Uh , although I find them a necessity in business and so forth , 

I , I try to refrain from their use as much as possible . Um , for a number of reasons , one of which is the , you know , extreme interest rate on most of them . Uh-huh . The one I use , uh , of course , for mostly , only for business purposes is , uh , you know , American Express . Right . And , uh , I 'm not I 'm not terribly in favor of them . Not for my own personal , uh , point of view . Right . Plus it , uh , has , you know , from an economic point of view it has increased our debt -- Yeah . -- tremendously -- Right . -- to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion , I believe -- Wow . -- uh , at least that 's one number for this range of numbers I have , I have heard . Right . Do you use them frequently or , 

Well , we , uh , me and my wife , when , when we have like extra money that we know we 're going to have , and we can put it in our budget , yeah , we 'll , we 'll use it . But like last year , I think we paid , I think it was like twenty something cents interest , on our Visa . Uh-huh . And I think this , this year we , uh , I think we used it for Christmas , and we got caught just a few days on our grace period . And , uh , so we 'll pay a little interest this year , but maybe two dollars . But we do n't like to do that at all . Yes . And , you know , we , I think we feel about the same way you do real strongly . We , uh , we have several credit cards , though . We have a gas card , our Visa , and then , of course , the American Express , and I think we have a couple of department stores . Uh-huh . But , we use it the same way , and , uh , 

I find the one I use mostly , uh , aside from the American Express , I do use my Sears card . Uh-huh . But , uh , I try , a- , as with the American Express , I try to pay it , you know , as it comes in . Right . Right . So , uh , It 's , it 's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill . That 's usually how we do it . 

I know when I travel , or when I used to travel overseas quite a bit , what I would do on my American Express card is before I would , before I left I would mail a check to , to American Express -- Uh-huh . -- and , you know , have some idea of how much was there , you know , I 'd sent them , you know , several hundred dollars , or whatever -- Uh-huh . -- I felt I would spend . Yeah . And then use it then . Yeah . But , uh , for hotels and , and so forth . But , uh , but I knew that it was paid . I knew -- Right . -- I knew that I had that much -- Yeah . -- credit , going in . Sometimes , you know , sometimes I would go over , but it would n't , you know , it would n't hit me in a big , in a big way because -- Right . -- I knew that , uh , I would have it covered in that respect . Right . That 's good . 

I 've , I do n't think we 've gone that far MUMBLEx , to pay it in ad- , you know , in advance before we spend it , but , I guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it , that , like that , Well , I found -- 

that may be good . -- I found in , um , in traveling overseas -- Uh-huh . -- that , uh , often it would , uh , it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card -- Oh really . -- for hotel bills and so forth . Yeah . Plus I would , uh , when they , uh , would send the bill , they would automatically convert to the exchange rate . Right , right . So , now , the only time that got to be a problem was , if the exchange rate changed drastically . Uh-huh . Uh , for example , I remember on one trip to France when I started planning the trip , I think , uh , a dollar was worth nine or ten Uh-huh . And whe , when I finally got over there , it had fallen , uh , two or three francs to the dollar . So the , Wow . So , I got caught a little short -- Wow . -- in that regard , but , uh -- Yeah . -- uh , I , I was anticipating , you know , my room would cost , uh , let 's say if it were , say sixty or seventy francs a night -- Right . -- that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so , or maybe twenty dolls- , maybe it would be more than that . It was more than . It would average out to thirty-five or forty dollars a night -- Right . -- which is a reasonable rate . Right . But then when I got back and I was working for the government at the time -- Uh-huh . -- of course the government was several months behind in , Right , yeah . their , on its per diem for exchange rate . Right . So there 's a little consternation , you know , in trying to get them to compensate , Yeah . for the difference in the exchange rate . Right . Yeah especially , That was the only time I really got caught short . And I , Yeah . But as I said , most , most of all I try not to use them , uh , to any , you know , lavishly , in that regard . Yeah , well tha- , that 's good . Well , from where are you calling ? Oh , from the Dallas area . So you 're from Dal- , okay , I 'm from Maryland . Oh really . Yeah . Wow . Do you work for T I ? No . I work for G T E . Well , really . Yes . Um . I wonder how T I got G T E involved . 

Well , I know Jack Godfrey . Oh , okay . I know him very well . I 've known Jack for a long time , and I 'm also in the speech business . Oh , okay . So , when I heard that Jack was going to do this , I called him and asked for an application where I could participate -- Yeah , yeah . -- in this . And , so that 's how I got involved . Yeah . You have a very , um , very , what 's the word . Your , your speech is very exact . Oh . Thank you very much . But , as Jack said , I 'm one of the , the old hands in the speech business . Oh really . Yeah , uh . Yes , I , I 've been doing it for twenty some odd years . Wow . And so , uh , I was very much interested , uh , in getting involved in , uh , switchboard . Yeah . So , uh , you work for T I ? Right . 

I work in MUMBLEx . Oh , really ? Yeah . I guess we 're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording . Yeah . I think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject , so , I think you get ten , so I think we 're okay . Alright . Okay , fine . 

Well , you have a good evening . Well , you too . It 's been pleasant talking to you . Same here . Take care . Good night . Bye .
