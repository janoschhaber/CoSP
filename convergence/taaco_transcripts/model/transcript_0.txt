Okay . Uh , first , um , I need to know , uh , how do you feel about , uh , about sending , uh , an elderly , uh , family member to a nursing home ? Well , of course , it 's , you know , it 's one of the last few things in the world you 'd ever want to do , you know . Unless it 's just , you know , really , you know , and , uh , for their , uh , you know , for their own good . Yes . Yeah . 

I 'd be very very careful and , uh , you know , checking them out . Uh , our , had t- , place my mother in a nursing home . She had a rather massive stroke about , uh , about -- Uh-huh . -- uh , eight months ago I guess . And , uh , we were , I was fortunate in that I was personally acquainted with the , uh , people who , uh , ran the nursing home in our little hometown . Yeah . So , I was very comfortable , you know , in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it . But there 's , well , I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be , you know , could not take care of herself anymore , was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really not a very good experience . Uh , it had to be done in a hurry . I mean , we did n't have , you know , like six months to check all of these places out . And it was really not , not very good , uh , deal . Yeah . We were not really happy with , Yeah . nursing home that we finally had . Fortunately , she only had to stay a few weeks and she was able to , to return to her apartment again . But it 's really a big , uh , big , uh , Yeah . decision as to , you know , when to do it . You know , is there something else we could have done , you know , in checking out all the places that , uh , might be available . Of course , you know , there 's not one on every corner , Yeah . especially , you know , smaller areas , Uh-huh . smaller towns . Uh-huh . Yeah . Probably the hardest thing in , in my family , uh , my grandmother , she had to be put in a nursing home and , um , she had used the walker for , for quite some time , probably about six to nine months . And , um , she had a fall and , uh , finally , uh , she had Parkinson 's disease , Oh . and it got so much that she could not take care of her house . Right . Then she lived in an apartment and , uh , that was even harder -- Uh-huh . -- actually . Uh-huh . Because it was , you know , it was just a change of , change of location and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling . Yes . I mean , she tr- , she had , she had children all across the United States -- Uh-huh -- and , you know , she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children . Right . Uh-huh . And , um , that was pretty heart-rending for her . I can imagine . I think when she finally came to the realization that , you know , no , I can not , I can not take care of myself . Uh-huh . That 's tough . That 's tough . Yeah . I mean , for somebody who is , you know , for most of their life has , has , uh , not just merely had a farm but had ten children -- Uh-huh . -- had a farm , ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines . Uh-huh . And , you know , facing that situation , it 's , it 's quite a dilemma . Yes . I think , my mother , excuse me . Go ahead . Yeah . Well , my , uh , my , uh , probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision -- Uh-huh . 

-- than just delegate it . I think that they , they had a great deal of , um , all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference . 

That 's great . And , I mean , it was just , it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family , getting down together and doing that . That 's right . And , and just the children were involved in the decision , because it involved just them . Right . Yeah . And , you know , making that decision and then finding a place 

and everybody had duties -- Uh-huh . -- to perform . You know , whether it was just , you know , giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot , Uh-huh . of the decision making , you know , Yep . like finding a proper nursing home . You were very , 

And they , fortunate . I know . They , and , well , they had , well , they had , they had seen it coming . Uh-huh . So , so , I mean , it , I mean , I , I , I , I har- , I , I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like , Uh-huh . that for me . Uh-huh . Absolutely . 

Unfortunately , a lot of times it , responsibilities like that seem to fall to , you know , maybe one child in the whole family , you know . Yeah . Yeah . Well , we , we , And , uh , it 's usually not a very smooth , Yeah . smooth thing . We were , I was lucky too that I only have one brother . Uh-huh . And , uh , fortunately , we agreed , you know , on exactly , you know , what we thought should be done . My mother also was very very independent . She had her own , still had her own little house and still driving her own car , Yeah . at age eighty-three . We were lucky in , that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she was n't really , you know , really much aware of what was going on . Uh-huh . That nursing home life would not have been , you know , anything of her choosing , of course , she would , she would not have been happy there at all . Um . But as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us . Yeah . Yeah . 

Well , with my , with my grandmother I think it was , it was such that , uh , that she did not have the problem with , she was very well aware and her daughter came and visited her -- Uh-huh . -- at least her daughter , Uh-huh . came and visited her and also her several grandchildren , Uh-huh . came and visited her every day . That 's great . And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest , um , I , I , I think it would be , it was more of a relief -- Uh-huh . -- for her . Sure . 

And , um , I mean , but she was truly , she was truly aware . I mean , I , I , I di- , I do n't know how I would , how I would deal if one of my parents came with , with Alzheimer 's . Uh-huh . or something like , 

That would be tough . that which is , which is far more devastating . Yes . Absolutely . And , um , I , I , I think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it was n't necessarily , you know , like the quantity of care -- Uh-huh . -- but the quality of , Yes . care . That the people that worked there -- Right . -- were very -- Uh-huh . -- were very interested that , to make it as close a home environment , Uh-huh . as possible . Yes . It would , I think , I think , I think , you know for myself I , I see that as probably the , the , what everything would hinge upon . Oh , Is it , how close is it to a home environment . Yes . That 's right . That 's the , that 's probably the major question . 

I think that great strides are being made nowadays in , in caring for the elderly , you know , in several , in a , Yeah . in a whole lot of areas . Yeah . Just people are , of course , populations getting older . Yeah . 

You know it 's , it 's interesting that , that a lot , the population of the United States is changing because , you know , uh , now that so many more minorities , where they have had extended families for such a long time . Uh-huh . Um , matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families . Uh-huh , It was n't , true . But , I guess as we become more industrialized and more , you know , less in a rural situation -- Yes , um . -- we , we do n't , we , we , we choose not to deal with the , Uh-huh . extended family -- Uh-huh . -- because we feel it 's kind of cumbersome , That 's right . when in reality it makes things much much easier . Sure . Absolutely . And , people , things are scattered so much nowadays . Yeah . I , I , I think that perhaps , perhaps the extended family , you know , that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care . Yes . You know I mean , of course there , there comes other issues , you know , whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like are going to be a good , they 're going to be a good caretaker for our children . Yes , But , just because they 're grandparents . 

I mean they raised us after all . Yeah . Just because they 're grandparents that does n't automatically make them a good child carer . Yeah . But , uh , I , I , I think that , you know , we always , uh , I mean , I 've , I 've had a lot of good experiences with , uh , with many many people especially where they 've had , uh , extended family . And I , and I , I kind of see that , that , you know , perhaps , you know , we may need to like get close to the family environment and -- Uh-huh . -- and get down to the values of , you know , I mean , uh , it 's , money seems to be too big of an issue . Oh , yeah . With , sure . with , with , realistically it is . with what 's going on today and I , I think , I think that we may not , that may be , you know , perhaps if we put money on the back burner -- Uh-huh . -- that may , that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem . That would , I mean , certainly help . 

I mean we may not , we may not have as high a standard of living -- Uh-huh . -- but the qua- , but actually have a truer standard of living . Right . That 's just a matter of defining priorities , I guess -- Yeah . Yeah . -- or some priorities anyway . Yeah . I think you 're right . Okay . Well , I guess that was it . Okay . It was good talking to you . Okay . Yeah . All right . Take care . Hey . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
