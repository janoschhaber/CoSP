Have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they 're either offering a service or they 're introducing some new product in the area and normally when they call , you 're either in the shower , or you 're in the middle of cooking something and you have to stop everything to run to the phone . Yes , yes . Is , is that one that you 're talking about . That was the big one I 'm talking about . I work weird hours , 

and invariably just about the time , I 'm going to sleep , the phone tears off the wall . Uh-huh , uh-huh . And you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone , you either hear , the cli- , as soon as you say hello , you hear the click of the recording coming on , Uh-huh . or you hear somebody all ready starting , reading off a list of stuff that they 've read probably a thousand times that day already . That 's true , or the ones that are , are generated by a computer . It 's just a computer voice that comes on the line . Those are the ones that I really , really hate too . I 've even had some of them , 

the , they 're voice activated and you 've got to say hello twice before they 'll do anything . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Yeah , sometimes I , I get them on my , uh , answering machine at home so , and I hate that when I 've got a whole bunch of messages 

and I go through them and most of them are n't from anybody at all . What I would love to see done to stop all of this , Uh-huh . we 've got a thing in this country , you can have your phone number unlisted , Uh-huh . and I think a law should be passed to where any of these people , I think it 's great , that you know , freedom of speech in this country and everything , but if they 're going to offer these services , or these recorded message , everything , they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them . Uh-huh , yes , see I have an unlisted telephone number , but I still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I do n't even understand . So , yeah , I do , I really feel that 's , uh , an invasion of my privacy . I agree with you on that particular subject there . Let me see . That 's about , that as far as any other everyday occurrences , I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door , either religious groups , or people peddling products . If I wanted their products , I would have either gone to the store to bought it , or I would have called for their salesman to come out . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Yeah , that 's true . 

Living in an apartment complex though , you know you ca n't , um , you ca n't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations , uh , but they still come up to the front door and , uh , you know , walk around . So , usually what I do is I 'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey , there 's people coming around , you know , and they 're trying to sell something or , or they 're from a religious organization and I really hate that . I really , really do . I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago and , uh , gosh it was about nine o'clock at night , too . It was n't even what I would consider , you know , family hours , time to , you know , start going to bed and uh , and it was somebody from , um , oh what was it , the , uh , Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , and uh , I 've read a lot about , uh , that particular sect and I do n't particularly care for it , so I especially do n't like for them to come up to my door and , and try and talk to me . Now , I agree with their right to , uh , pursue their religion of choice , in that , whatever manner they want to , but I think they should also respect the sanctity of the American home , whether it be in a house or in an apartment . 

I 'm on my turf , if I want them there , I 'll call for them , otherwise , I do n't want to know they exist . Yeah , yeah , no , I , I agree with you there . If they want to choose that particular religion that 's fine with me too , you know , as long as they do n't try and pull me in and drag me in . And , and I do n't like the way that they do it either , and , and , it 's their mission that they do it . They go door to door 

and they go out into the public and they actually have the , uh , teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work and , uh , I do n't know , I just , um , do n't particularly care for that at all . And that , that 's one thing that I feel really strongly about though , is , uh , you know , people coming up to my door , and especially religious organizations and wanting to uh , you know , to try and get me to join or , you know , become interested in their religion , because I have my own . Now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting , I 've even gone so far as to put that , I 've got a storm door on the front of the house and I 've put , in , I do n't know how much clearer it can be , it 's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting . I should have , I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise , cause I still get , Yeah , yeah , that 's true , yeah . No I do n't , uh , I do n't have , I did n't go that far but , uh , yeah I probably could do the same thing , uh , you know , I do n't have a storm door , but I 'm sure I could rig up something . But you know I do n't think that that would stop people . I , it 's like they see that word and it says go , instead of stop . Oh , goodness . and then reverse it , and do , well that would be technically illegal , it would be harassment . Oh gosh . But , I consider an invasion of my privacy , Yeah , yeah . a harassment in itself . Yeah , yeah , yeah , that 's true , that 's true , um . Well what else ? I believe we 've pretty much summed everything up . I know , but I remember you , you talked about something , you started off and said , well let me think , you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door . You said something else . I ca n't remember what it was , and I thought yeah , that , that kind of touched a nerve right there , but we got uh , we got to talking about the , uh , uh , people coming to you at the front door . I 'm drawing a blank . Oh goodness , okay , is our five minutes up ? Uh , pretty close to it . Pretty close . Well I 've enjoyed talking with you . Well it was nice talking to you too Jim . And take it easy now . Okay , thanks , bye . Good night .
