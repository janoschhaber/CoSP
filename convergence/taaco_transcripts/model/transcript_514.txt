Well , how do you feel about trial by jury ? I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently . Uh , In what way ? In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than , uh , by evidence that 's presented . I have , uh , very little regard for the law , 

presently practiced . Oh , do , do you feel they are swayed more toward , are you talking about with criminal or civil suits ? I was thinking primarily criminal cases . So , do you think that , I mean the the stereotypical bleeding heart juries -- Yes . 

-- where they feel sorry . Uh-huh . That 's a concern of mine . Uh , I would feel more comfortable in many cases I think with judges . Uh , you know , doing the sentencing . Uh-huh . The other thing , the only thing that really bothers me about that is I think you know , that a judge can be 

I , I like the idea of juries of your peers -- Uh-huh . -- uh , in that you , you , you get more personally more than one person making the , making a decision . And second of all , you get a wide variety of background so that , Yeah , my question I guess are they really your peers ? Uh-huh . I 'd -- Uh , -- agree with that . That 's definitely a problem . Uh , too often I think they are not -- Uh-huh . 

-- and , uh , when you , when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if , if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have -- Uh-huh . -- you know that is a matter of concern to me too . Uh , I think that , uh , in such cases , uh , they are not really looking for unbiased people , but rather for biased . Uh-huh . Uh , now I happen to know several judges and there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has me- , doing sentencing without the jury . I would feel a little bit uneasy about -- Uh-huh . -- but the other two I feel , uh , would give either you know , the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law . Uh-huh . And I guess that 's what I am concerned with . Yeah , yeah . I , guess I , I definitely agree with you , but sin- , the 

well , what I do n't like about , uh , sentence , the jury doing the sentencing -- Uh-huh . -- in that I think it becomes a lot less , the , the same crime gets unequal sentences . This is very true . I , uh , I think there is more of an ability of you know , you know for selecting a jury , two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea , uh , the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty -- Uh-huh . -- or innocent -- Uh-huh . -- but , I think , I think there would be a large variation in , in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board . Yeah and you do see such uneven sentencing -- Uh-huh . -- you know , evidence of it in the newspapers and such , I mean -- Uh-huh . -- where , uh , it would appear the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty-five years and the other one was sentenced to life . So , Uh-huh . Uh , Of course a lot of that 's also the ability of , of the defendant to , uh , get a good lawyer . Is n't that the truth ? Uh-huh . There are times when is it , uh , oh goodness , my mind has gone blank it 's , uh , Othello . You know where he says kill all the lawyers . Every now and then one is tempted to see what , what . Yeah , 

I agree . But , I , it 's taken me a long time to understand that , uh , lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice -- Uh-huh . -- as we think of , you know , as , as -- Uh-huh . -- novices tend to think that , uh , attorneys care about justice . Oh , yeah , I , I agree with it yeah . They will admit to you that they can- , do n't have the benefit of being able to you know , of , of , letting , allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty -- Uh-huh . -- it 's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument . And -- That the , -- they are very effective too . Uh-huh . Uh , even , I have been involved , uh , just sli- , slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , his attorneys gotten him off . Uh-huh . Uh , the city has dropped their charges against him because their , the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge . So I do n't know . Yeah . Uh , this is a little bit of the subject , but one , one thing that I really dislike , uh , also that 's , that 's new is the , uh , is that I have heard that there are federal sentences ,
