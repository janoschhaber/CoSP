Okay , so what kind of cars are you looking at ? Well , we 've , uh , we 've , we 've test driven the Oldsmobile Delta Eighty-eight -- Uh-huh . -- and a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac , about three or four years old -- Uh-huh . -- because , uh , I get married in a couple of weeks and I have two kids and my fiancee has two kids -- Uh-huh . -- so we need a car that 's big enough for six . Yeah . And so we went , I guess it was two weekends ago , we went , uh , car shopping -- Uh-huh . -- and looked around . We found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac up there on Central Expressway -- Uh-huh . -- that , uh , in addition to getting a new car there , they can get you a car that 's new but it 's been , uh , a demonstrator model -- Oh , okay . -- for two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car . Uh-huh . So , they call this program cars , and they come , with a new car warranty , and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that . Right . That 's a real good deal . In fact my dad recently got a , um , a Pontiac , uh , believe six thousand -- Uh-huh . -- and he got a demo . Okay . And it 's been a real good car -- Yeah . -- and it 's , it 's like new -- Uh-huh . -- and it only had , had very , very low mileage on it . Sure . And so I think he got a real good deal . Of course , they 're fully loaded usually . Oh yeah . 

So it 's , I think it 's a pretty good option . Yeah , I think so too . Are the , uh , Oldsmobiles that you 're looking at , are they the demos or they used , are they new . 

Well , the ones that we were test driving were the , uh , were the new ones -- Uh-huh . -- there . Uh-huh . Well now , uh , now , they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in . Uh-huh . And then the Cadillac is , is definitely a used car or , Yeah . Uh-huh . The guy said it 'd been on the lot about thirty minutes . He says it 'll probably be gone in a done , and it 's probably gone by now . Oh no . Those things go fast . Uh-huh . Uh , of course we 're not , we ca n't consider getting a brand new Cadillac , because those are twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars . Yeah . But when they 're three years old they 're , the price already drops in half . Uh-huh . So then it becomes , uh , more realistic . Right . 

That 's what I 'm thinking about on my next car is do I want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new -- Uh-huh . -- or do I look for a used car that 's maybe two , three years old that -- Yeah . -- but that 's , you know , low mileage and in good shape . But I just , I kind of worry about getting a car that 's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it . Is it a lemon , or , That 's right . or is something wrong with it but -- That 's right . -- I guess that 's a risk you have to take . Well , you can reduce that risk by , uh , having the car checked out , I mean , you know , if you 're going to look at fifty different cars you do n't want to do this -- Uh-huh . -- but if you 've narrowed it down to one or two -- Uh-huh . -- you can have the car , uh , uh , checked at , uh , an independent service station -- Uh-huh . -- and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong , because they do n't have any financial interest in it . Right . And then you 'll have a realistic assessment of what you 're getting . Uh-huh . About how much do they charge to do something like that , 

do you know ? Oh , I 'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars . Yeah , that 's not bad . No , huh-uh . 

It 'd be well worth it if you 're considering buying a car . I would , I would think so . to find out . I would think so . Yeah , yeah . 

Well , it 's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because I just got mine paid off about a month ago , and I , Is n't that a good feeling . Yes , I do n't want to think about buying a car for a while . I just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while -- That 's right . -- and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and , uh , you know , hang on to the one I 've got for a few years because it 's , it 's , it 's almost four years old , but it 's still in great shape . I have a Mazda R X seven . 

Well , what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years -- Uh-huh . -- and when you 're ready to get another car just pay cash for it . Yeah , I just about could really -- Yeah . -- because I think my car , if I continue taking good care of it , it 's going to hold a pretty good resale value -- 

Oh yeah . -- and , uh , if I consider going the used car route and save up some money , I should n't have too much trouble at all . Yeah , I , I would think that 's true . Could you hold on for just a moment ? Sure . Okay . 

I 'm on a cordless phone , and I was picking up , uh , some background noise , so I just switched the channel up on it . I did n't want to interfere with whatever they 're trying to record . Right , right , that 's fine . Anyway . But , uh , I really , I really enjoy the car I have now , and I do want to hold onto it and , and you know , enjoy it while it 's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever , That 's right . in fact it never has -- That 's right . -- and , uh , it 's been kind of nice , and I , surprisingly enough after four years , I 'm not tired of the car at all and -- Well . -- I want to hang on to it while it 's still being a good car and while I 'm not tired of it and while I 'm single -- Yeah . -- and can handle a two seater for now -- That 's right . -- and get that out of my system . That 's right . Because one of these days I 'll be getting a six seater probably too . Eventually . So , Yeah , the first two cars I ever bought , well , uh , uh , I 've bought three cars , and I 've always bought them new . Uh-huh . 

The first car I kept for thirteen and a half years -- Wow . -- and got a hundred and sixty-one thousand out of it . Uh-huh . The second car I ever bought I drive to work now . That just turned ten years old , and I 've got a hundred and twenty-two thousand miles on that . Uh-huh . So that , that 's kind of in the way I 've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever . Uh-huh . But , uh , my car is using two quarts of oil a week now . Oh my gosh . About , about a quart every hundred miles . Oh , no . So , but , uh , it runs fine , all you hav , it 's just very thirsty . Yeah . If I just keep the oil in , it seems to be okay . But , you know , that 's a sign that I 'm going to have to do something sooner or later . Right . What kind of car is it ? It 's a , a Buick Century . Uh-huh . 

Are you going to trade it in on this new one or , No , my fiance is selling , uh , a nineteen seventy-eight Cutlass Supreme that she has . It 's actually , Okay . in better condition than my car . Uh-huh . And so she 's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible -- Uh-huh . -- to keep the monthly payment low . So she 's going to sell it rather than trade it in . Yeah . That 's probably the best thing . You lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in . Or maybe more than that , as I 've learned . 

Oh really . Yeah . When I bought my R X seven , I , uh , best offer I got for my other car was twenty-five hundred . Well I turned around and sold it myself for forty-two hundred . So , 

Oh there you go . You can do much better . I 'm glad you 're , you 're taking care of it yourself . I , I think trading it in , they just use that as additional , they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you 're buying , but they just , are going to give you that much less for your trade in . Well that 's fact . What I think . So , 

I think you 're right . But strangely enough , the best off- , I mean , the best bargaining I had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place I got the best price -- Interesting . -- trade in , but it 's a place in Arlington , and I think , maybe , as you get outside the Dallas area , I kind of , I bet you it 's kind of what I decided . Well , maybe because it 's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better prices , plus I was going through that T I fleet discount program . Okay , did , did you use it at the car shop place . Well , it 's before they had that . Oh , okay . I had gone over to Texins and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the , in the fleet program , That 's right , yeah . 

and what you could expect , they said , you know , a five percent over cost -- Right . -- and then options at cost and everything . Right . So , I figured out a price based on that . Yeah , that 's good . But I , I guess I got a pretty good deal , because I went back to the Town North Mazda right off Central -- Uh-huh . -- and offered them the same price as what I knew I was going to be able to get it for in Arlington -- Right . -- and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price , especially if we add on the equalizer -- Yeah . -- and the cruise control . Yeah . He said , You 're going to get a car that 's got flood damage or hail damage . And they just laughed at me . And I went the next morning to Arlington , and they gave it to me for that price . And what 's so funny , they took the car , they , I knew they were going to pull it from Town North because that 's where the white one was . Is that right . And they had already told me , We located one at Town North . So it was that same car . My gosh . Yeah , well , unless you 're selling car with hail damage and flood damage , I got the car off your lot for that price . And you laughed all the way to the bank . 

Oh I did . And I laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand mile checkup -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , that they required you to do . And I took it to Town North , and sure enough I saw that guy , and he recognized me . Yeah . He said , Oh , hi , Dana , and he kind of looked down and saw that car , and I 'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day -- Yeah . -- of course , when the place in Arlington went and took the car -- That 's right . -- because I told him there 's a place in Arlington that 's going to give it to me for that price . He said , No they 're not . Yeah . 

And the next day they pulled the white car and took it to Arlington . So I 'm sure he knew . Such a deal . 

So I loved it . I sat there , and I just had the biggest grin on my face . I 'll bet you did . It was kind of nice . 

Well , Dana , it 's been really interesting , I appreciate talking with you . Yeah . Good talking to you too , Don . Okay have a good evening . Okay , good luck in your car hunting . Thank you much . Uh-huh . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
