Okay , uh , I was just trying to think about how I , how I dress for work , you know , T I is a very casual atmosphere . Uh-huh . And , uh , what I usually do on the weekend is , is lay out five outfits and , uh , on Monday I , I wear the , the worst looking one . Because it does n't seem like people are really , ar , you know , are that alive on Monday , you know , so . Yeah . And then progressively through the week , I 'll , I 'll wear nicer looking things and then on Friday most everybody wears jeans , jeans and sweatshirts , or , you know , jeans and blouses or something like that . Uh , but mostly what I wear are skirts and blouses or , you know , skirts and , uh , pullover sweaters or , uh , you know , little two piece dress suit , suits like , but . Yeah , uh , you know , that 's a good way to approach it . I 've never thought about , um , I do plan my clothes a week in advance . Actually , I plan them a month in advance . I usually do a month at a time , so I do n't repeat an outfit . Uh-huh . But , um , I 've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday , because really no one 's paying attention . But anyway , um , I really , I do n't work outside of school . Um , I work in the computer lab at school so I can just wear whatever I have on for school , an , and , um , and really it 's , I try to dre , dress presentable but very comfortable . Right . Like , um , in the warm weather it 's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that and then in the winter time it 's jeans or , or pants . I usually , uh , you know , college is so casual , 

you really do n't want to dress up unless you , you , uh , have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that , so . Right . Like where I work , it 's , it 's pretty casual , uh , it 's , it 's , I guess it 's more like a , a college campus also , I mean there 's hundre- , you know , hundreds of people work for T I . Yeah . And , uh , a lot of people just , just wear jeans and , and , uh , sweats all the time 

and they dress up like when customers are coming in , or , uh , when we have department meetings or something like that . And , uh , you know , a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their , the real , uh , higher ups , Uh-huh . like the the , lawy- , the T I lawyers , and , uh , those that work for the , the higher executives , those secretaries . They , uh , they really dress up all the time . Oh . So there 's a good combination in the hallways all the time , you know . Well that 's good that they 're so casual . Yeah . I mean , uh , my brother works for T I and he 's a computer programmer , or computer engineer . Uh-huh , uh-huh . 

And , uh , you know , whenever he was going to school , he was expecting to having to wear , uh , a tie or a dress shirt everyday . But , uh , he goes to work in his blue jeans , t-shirt , Uh-huh . and tennis shoes , and he just loves it . 

And that 's very acceptable at T I . Yeah . I believe at I B M they , they make you wear a blue suit and , uh , some kind of colored shirt and a tie . That 's what I 've heard . Uh-huh , I wo , I would hate to be in that atmosphere . But , uh , I mean , they , they just moved into the new building , he calls it the new building . I do n't know , it 's where all the executives are . Uh-huh . 

And , um , and so they were , they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the , all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans . But , he just left for Italy today at four , Oh . and he 'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them . 

I see . Over in T , I mean for T I but over in Italy . Yeah , oh , T I is everywhere . Oh , yeah , he was so excited about going . Uh-huh . But , uh , he did n't carry any ties or anything because he , he just went over there with the that attitude , well if I do n't take it then they wo n't make me wear it . That 's true , that 's a good idea . Because , uh , he just , he did n't , you know , he 's not really into all that . He would wear it if he had to for his job and all 

but , you know , if he had the preference , I mean his , his preference is , um , blue jeans and a t-shirt , so . Uh-huh . But I think that 's great about T I , and also , uh , to get off the clothing , the smokers , you know , how they have the , The , no , the different designated areas for smokers and stuff . Right . I think that 's great . Yeah , and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke , smoke area and you do n't smoke , you almost strangle . Oh , really . Do you smoke ? So much smoke in the air . Yeah , areas , the smoking area , you know , it 's closed in , Uh-huh . and if you don- , if you do n't smoke and you go in there , tha , everybody that goes in there smokes so it 's full of smoke when , when you go in there . I used to smoke a long time ago . I think that 's , um , I used to burn my clothes , talking about getting back to clothes . I used to burn my clothes with cigarettes . That 's one of the reason that I stopped . Well , um , y- , you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college . Well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions and , uh ? Yeah , she always had , uh , yeah , she always had to have a lot of clothes . See that 's how , that 's how I am but my mamma was not raised like that and so , No , I , I was n't either , she , my daughter , she 's real good at finding sales though , you know . Oh , me to , 

boy I have -- Sh- , she 'll buy a lot of , -- to , hunt them down . sh- , yeah , she 'll buy a lot clothes , at the end of seasons , you know , Uh-huh . and , uh , just have them for the next year . And she , you know , she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and , uh , buys clothes . Uh , whe , you know , when they were coming up , I , I did n't sew , but now I 've , I 've learned how to sew , 

so I 'm , well I 'm , I 'm still learning how , but I 'm ge , and I 'm getting much better at it and I , 

That 's great . I 'm going to be able to make my own clothes . I wanted to take a sewing class at school but I just have n't fit it into my schedule yet , but that , I mean , that can really benefit . Right . 

Um , that 's something that I 'd be very interested in , very interested in learning . Right , because clothes are s- , are really expensive . Uh , they 're outrageous ! You know , uh , uh , a little simple shell , shell blouse , you know , that you can make for about , say ten dollars at , you know , at , at the most out of a decent fabric , Uh-huh . boy , runs you like twenty something dollars in the store . Yeah it 's , Just a little shell to go under a suit , you know . it 's marked up . It is , it is really outrageous but , uh , I mean like whenever I , I was growing up and all , my mom , I never understood this then , but I do now , 

but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars , or , Uh-huh . um , or she would n't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that and she always told me it was because I was still growing and she was n't going to buy me something I was going to grow out of next week . Right , 

especially to pay that kind of money for it . Yeah . I have a friend who , uh , she had a , she had a ba- , a little boy and , uh , she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus . I mean , Oh no . she dressed him , uh , fabulously . And then , seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff . Uh-huh . And she finally learned that you just can not do this , you know . So now she finds the basement sales and , just like , you know , everybody else . 

That 's the best way to shop . I mean , I always thought my mom was being mean to me but I look back at it now and my child is going to , I mean , I 'm going to raise mine the same way . Right . Um , I do n't know , I just , they 're just so outrageously priced , it 's just incredible . Yes , and you , I try to , uh , always catch the sales . Right . Always . And , yeah , and you just have to keep buying them , you know . If you , if you , if you 're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the , the quality is really not that great , you know , for the price that you pay . Yeah , 

it , it depends on , um , yeah , there 's , there 's always a reason why they 're on sale . Right . So that , that has a lot to do with it . Right . But , um , well , Like I bought , I bought the most beautiful swe- , uh , sweater from , uh , I believe it was Ross Dress For Less . Uh . And it wa , it was really pretty , it was just , you know , it was just plain , a plain , uh , ro , you know , round , uh , necked , uh , sw- , sweater . Uh-huh . And it had , like , it was embellished around the , the top , you know , it had , uh , leather , leather designs and , um , some other , other little things on it 

and I just thought it was so pretty and I go , I got it at a real good price , I think maybe it was nine ninety-nine or something . 

Oh , that 's great . And it was so pretty , and after I wore it a couple of times I realized why , why it was , Uh , oh . it was so cheap . There was , in the middle of the back of it , there was , it 's like there , it had been slit and they had like just sewed it back together , Oh , no . right in the middle of the back , you know , was n't a seam or anything , you know . Uh-huh . And that 's why it was so cheap , although , it 's not , it 's not really noticeable , uh , from the outside , but , but still , it 's , you know , it 's really not , not , not a good quality . And then I was told by somebody that works for J C Penney 's that , uh , Ross , Ross is just one of those places that sell , sells seconds . The defect . Yeah , yeah , um , they do n't really buy the first quality , they buy the second . And , uh , places like J C Penney 's that they 'll reject the seconds , they 'll send them back every time . Uh-huh . But places like Ross Dress For Less and , uh , T J Max . T J Max does that , Uh-huh . yeah we have a T J Max over here and , um ,
