Okay , um , Chuck , do you have any pets there at your home ? Yeah , I do . And what kind do you have ? 

I 've got a male Siamese about a year old here . I live alone in an apartment , and , uh , -- Uh-huh . -- except for the cat . Uh-huh . How about you ? Well , we have a cat , um , 

he 's probably , oh , a good two years old , big , old , fat and sassy tabby . Uh-huh . Oh . Uh , how 's the disposition of your Siamese cat ? Well , it 's , uh , you know they 're just , uh , aggressive by nature -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , he 's been neutered and declawed , so -- Uh-huh . -- he 's an indoor cat , so , uh , that kind of calms him down for the most part . How about yours ? 

Well , yeah , he 's , uh , he has been really aggressive , uh , especially towards my little girl , for -- Huh . -- some reason . He 's , uh , been so mean to her . And , and you say you 've had him how long ? We 've had him for about two years -- Two years . -- and he was so mean to her , um , right after we first got him . So we had him neutered , and , and declawed , and now he bites her . 

He ca n't -- Huh . -- scratch her any more , he bites her . Does he bite her enough to draw blood ? Yeah , yeah , he has a couple of times , so . Uh-huh . But he 's a very possessive cat . He , he loves my son , it 's his cat , 

and he 's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him -- Yeah . -- and he 's so funny , he just follows my son around just like a dog . Huh . He wo n't even let my son shower . Yeah . He meows and wants to get in the bathroom and , while he showers , it 's so hilarious . So he 's quite a animal . Yeah , boy , I guess . Well as long as he does n't get too aggressive . I guess with the daughter he 's all right . Yeah . You would n't want him to carry her off or something . Yeah , well , we , we did , uh , actually take him to the pound a couple of times , you know -- Uh-huh . 

-- because we just could n't have him being -- Sure . -- so aggressive towards the girl , but , uh , he seems to have mellowed out a little bit , and we do keep our daughter away from him . So . Yeah , yeah . Were it not for my son , the cat would not be in this house . 

Is that the only pet that you have ? It is , uh-huh . We , we tried a dog about four years ago , and we ended up with , uh , oh , malamute and some other kind of mix . Anyway it was , it ended up being just a huge , huge dog that ate us out of house and home . So , we gave him up and tried . Well , do you live , you , you in a house , or a place where you , uh , Yes , uh-huh , 

we 're in a house , but we 're in a subdivision -- I see . -- where we really ca n't allow the dog , we could n't allow him to run free , so , he was just chained up all the time , and it was , it was -- Sure . -- unfortunate . So have you tried any other pets ? No , no . I , I live alone in an apartment , 

and , uh , it 's , it 's not that big that , uh -- Oh . -- although I 've heard rabbits are pretty good -- Oh . -- you know , I saw something on C N N or on cable here -- Uh-huh . -- a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments -- Oh , my word . -- and in houses , and they apparently , uh , especially when they 're young when they bring them in -- Oh , my word . -- uh , . And do they , they just paper train it or something ? 

I guess . I guess , yeah , and I would imagine that they do n't have many more than one to start with , either . Yeah . Well , rabbits are darling . That would be fun if you could get them trained . Otherwise they 're pretty smelly . Yep , that 's right . Oh . Did you see the , the C N N , the , the dog show , uh , Huh-uh , we do n't have C , we do n't have cable . I see . Well they have , uh , uh , a Wesmin- , they call it the Westminster Dog Show , uh , I think it 's in New York City at the , at the Gardens there once a year live -- Oh . -- and they had that on last week , and that 's really kind of something -- Oh . -- to watch , uh , it 's on , I think , two or three nights for maybe an hour or two -- Is that right ? -- and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there . Oh . Some of them are really beautiful , too . Uh-huh . So . Well , I 'd be , interesting to watch . So you live in Utah do you ? Yes , uh-huh . Elton . Goodness . We live out here by , it 's by Ogden . It 's north of Salt Lake City , Utah -- Uh-huh . -- and we really love it out here . It 's , uh , kind of country . We 're , we 're only about ten minutes from Ogden . Uh-huh . So , we 're kind of country but not too . Well do you all work for T I , or for , No , huh-uh . Do you ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Oh , well , see , I 'm getting so many calls to Texas . This is the very first one I 've , I 've talked to . Oh , well , great . Yeah , I 've been doing it for about two weeks and , uh , no my , Uh-huh . No my ,
