Well , uh , I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in , in specific , uh , very specific in this , uh , very specific examples such as , uh , transportation workers , as in , uh , air traffic controllers , bus drivers and that kind of thing . Well . Um , I do n't really think that it 's , uh , too many , I think it 's a severe invasion of somebody 's privacy to say , well , we 're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you 're , uh , you know , worthy of working for us . I really do n't see that that 's a very , very valid , uh , thing for a company to say , and I , personally , I do n't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what 's inside my body . Yeah , uh , I guess I basically agree that , uh , do you think it 's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they 'll take drugs ? I mean suppose they found out some other way ? Well , I think , I think we , I think the problem here is , is that a , a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs . Yeah . There 's too many cases where it can , you know , there can be false positive results , and that , that sort of thing . I do n't think there 's any definitive , you know , 

okay this person is taking drugs , so we do n't want him here . Yeah . Uh , like I said , some industries , though , I think it 'd be very necessary , I would n't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I 'm flying in an airplane . Yeah . But , uh , I , I just , I find it to be pretty offensive that , that it 's such a , a big deal . I mean , if your employer 's not going to trust you or , you know , it , I just , I think it 's a whole trust issue . I just ca n't see it . But , have you ever been in a situation where you , you were drug tested or , Uh , yeah , I have been . Yeah . I . I once too , so . I mean , I was very offended by , by the whole process . Yeah . I mean it 's very humiliating , 

and , I mean , I 'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs , but I , uh , I am totally against that sort of a , uh , I mean it 's , it 's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I 'm going to talk to you . Yeah . 

I had it during a job interview , and I just thought it was dumb of the company , at a point where they were trying to convince me to , to want to work for them -- Right . -- to do this , and I 'm just like , well , uh , I 'm not even going to think much about it -- Yeah . -- if you 're going to treat me with this much respect even before -- Right . -- you 've gotten to know me . Right . That 's , that 's basically my opinion on it , right there , is that it 's just , you know , I did , I , I was in the same sort of situation as , it was a job interview and then you had a physical , where you were drug tested , and it 's , I just , and I know people who have been drug tested and who have not , you know , been hired by a corporation which , uh , you know , I really . The other side of it is , is , besides its being an invasion of personal privacy , as in my , it 's my bodily fluid and I do n't really want you to look at it , or -- Uh-huh . -- or something pretty basic like that , 

just to the fact that I do n't know that it is a company 's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they 're not at work . I mean , during the eight hours , during the day , when they 're supposed to be there , I think they have every right to say this is , these behaviors are acceptable and these are not , but when it enters into what they 're doing when they 're not at work , I find that to be fairly offensive also . Yeah , well like you say , I mean , if it 's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt , then really what people ought to be doing , I mean , the , the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work -- Right . 

-- rather than on these other factors . Right . And , I mean , if you are doing drugs and it 's causing a problem , then they 'll notice it for other reasons . That 's exactly right . Yeah . And also I just think it , it gets a lot , I 'm a big , uh , supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies , and I think that it just moves down along a line that , that I really would find bad if , if most people went down that line into regulating employees ' lives outside of work , you know , there 's already talk of people , well , we 're not going to hire you if you smoke . MUMBLEx . Well , you know , I , I can see how they can say in the work place we , you do n't want them to smoke , but when somebody leaves work , I do n't think that it 's the employer 's right to regulate their life style at all . 

Well , do you think it 's , should be illegal for an employer to do this or , Uh , I really think it should be , except as I 've mentioned twice now , in the specified industries -- Yeah . -- or , or jobs , because there are certain things where it 's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times . And other than that I think , I do not think it should be allowable . I think it should be illegal for them to , to want to do that . It should , it 's kind of the big brother syndrome , I mean , I just , anything like that just kind of scares me . I tend to , to view it , 

even though I do n't think I 'd work for a company that did that , I sort of want to defend an employer 's rights as opposed to an in- , uh , in addition to an individual 's rights , but an employer , really , I think , has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to -- Right . -- and if they say they do n't want smokers , I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that . Right . Uh , and I do n't really ,
