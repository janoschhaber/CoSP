Okay . What , uh , go ahead and tell me about your home . Well , my home at the moment is an apartment . 

Oh , is that right ? . Yeah . I work here in Germantown , but I live in Pensacola , Florida . Oh , that 's interesting . So , I own a home in Pensacola , and , uh , let 's see , we are to compare homes . Correct ? Okay . Yeah . Uh , my home is , well , is typical for the area . I live in a development , uh , it 's a relatively , I would say , well , God , it sounds like , sounds like I 'm bragging . No , that 's okay . But it 's upper middle class , Okay . uh , kind of an environment . It 's a two story colonial , which my wife and I designed . Oh , that 's neat . Uh , it has around thirty-two hundred square feet . Wow , that 's large . Uh , five bedrooms and so forth and so on , and it is , I would imagine in terms of , of size and so forth , it 's relatively typical for the area . 

It might be , I would say it 's probably midsized for the area . There are some smaller , and there are , s- , you know , several larger . Uh-huh . And , uh , but based , you know , in terms of , you know , in , in Pensacola , in that area of Florida it , uh , it 's what now , it is , uh , probably ten years old . Oh , well , that 's not too bad , Yeah . that 's still fairly new . And so it 's , in terms of cost and , and , and size and so forth , it , uh , the hou- , you know , housing there is extremely affordable , and , uh , compared to other parts of the country , you know , let 's say compared to Maryland , Well , that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars but , Oh , you 're kidding . Well , do you mind if I ask what it 's worth down there , I mean , what it 's , I really have n't , I really have n't , uh , when we built it ten years ago , it was , it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars . Okay . So , I , I would have really , I have n't really priced , you know , in the market , 

so I , It , it sounds like , I mean , from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand . Uh-huh . I mean , Dallas is a very marked up area , although right now it 's a lot lower , Uh-huh . um , because of all the layoffs and everything the economy around here is real poor . I thought that was on the upswing again now . Well , no , not really . Uh-huh . 

Um , the area itself , uh , the Fort Worth Dallas area , um , has become kind of depressed because there 's been so many layoffs with big companies , including Texas Instruments . Yes . Um , there 's been tremendous amounts of , of , uh , layoffs so , really housing is real bad . The economy itself around here is not too terribly bad , but housing is still real bad . Uh-huh . Yeah . Well , Pensacola has it 's really is a buyer 's market there now . Yeah . This is , 

And it is n't because of the , well , there has been a lot of speculative building . Oh . Uh , I do n't know , perhaps not in Dallas , but , uh , I 'm sure people in , uh , you know , in , uh , Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it , uh , Pensacola is a Navy town . Uh-huh . And home porting was a possibility a few years ago . Oh . They were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy , Wow . MUMBLEx a new carrier was coming in and , uh , the , uh , attendant , uh , support vessels . Well , that 's no longer , So , do you think , the case . it was overdeveloped then ? Oh , it 's , it is . I mean , the , the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population . Wow . And so i- , overbuilding is , i- , has been a real problem there . Um . So you can still get a , get a , a good house for a very , very reasonable price . And I mean good , I would , let 's say typical , say three bedroom , uh , two and a half baths , on a half acre or so of land , uh , reasonable construction would probably run you , uh , right now anywhere between , somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars . Um , And probably , perhaps , yeah . cheaper , depending upon the neighborhood . Yeah . What about your home ? Well , right now we 're just renting , but it is a home . Um , Uh-huh . it 's a four bedroom home . 

It has about , I guess , eighteen hundred square feet . It 's on one floor . Uh-huh . Uh , we have no basement . I do n't know , Nor do we , but , Okay . I was n't sure . Most of the ones , you know , up north and everything do , but , um , anyway , it 's , uh , it 's pretty , also pretty typical for the area . Most of this area was developed , this house was built in seventy-four . Uh-huh . So most of the , it 's almost twenty years old , and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style . Uh , we have a friend that lives two blocks over , and his house is almost identical to us , except his is three bedrooms and ours is four -- Uh-huh . -- but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same . So I , I think most of them are 

there was , it , like most areas that are built , um , there were probably , like two or three styles you could choose from . Right . And , and , uh , that 's pretty much all the houses in the area , for probably a square mile , I 'd say , at least , maybe even a little bit more than that . 

Well , the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious . And in , in the entire D C area . I 'm , I 'm only about , uh , twelve miles or so from the , uh , border of Washington D C , and Montgomery County , Maryland is probably one of the most expensive , Where are you in relation to Sevren ? places to , are you close to Sevren ? No , we are west . Okay . Sevren is east , near the eastern shore , Well , I just , if I had , 

I have a sister that used to live in Sevren . Uh-huh . And they bought their home in I , I want to say like around nineteen seventy-five or something like that , and they paid like , they , they had it built from , you know , they , they designed it and everything , and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it , and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand . Oh , that 's not unusual , yeah . Yeah , so I just wondered , you know , if the whole area was like that or , Well , that 's , that area over there is not as expensive as in the , the immediate , you know , Washington area . Uh-huh . And so , we , uh , I was just looking , for example there is a , uh , condominium complex next to the apartment complex where I live , 

and I was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium . And ninety-two thousand dollars for a two bedroom , which is essentially a two bedroom apartment . Um . Now , it was very nicely done . Yeah . I would have thought , Sounds like a lot of money though , Yes . I , sure . I ca n't , I ca n't envision spending that much money , and on , on something along those lines . Yeah . So , you know , it 's , y- , I guess you pay the piper but , Right . Plus the , the , the taxes around here are phenomenally , Oh , yeah . high . Uh , for the , and so , you , on that , it 's not unusual , for example , for somewhere around here on a , on a , on a , what we would , you know , what you described as your house and what I would describe as my house say , for example , in Pensacola , Florida , on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on , might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes . Wow . May- , Yeah . maybe , you know , maybe a little bit higher than that now , but that same house here , you 'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year , 

taxes on it . Wow . Wow , that 's , So , it 's , uh , 

so , the question of whether to buy here or move to another county , say , drive twenty more miles north , buy a condominium for approximately , uh , the same price , maybe a little lower , but the taxes would be , you know , perhaps , maybe one-third -- Really ? -- uh , of , 

That much of a difference ? Oh , absolutely . Wow . Yeah , so , it 's , it 's really sad . Yeah . This is one , this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country . Wow . Why is that ? Do you know ? I mean , Well , they , it , the , their , they do have an extremely good , such things as extremely good school systems , for example . It has one of the best school systems in the country . Uh-huh . Uh , and because the cost of living around here is so high , Oh . public employees make great salaries around here . Oh . I was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the , 

Montgomery County Public Schools makes , a- , an- , and I 'm not , this is , uh , the figure , he makes eighty thousand dollars a year . 

My goodness . That 's , Wow . and I , by administrator I , I think I mean , I , they did n't , they did not define it , but for example , a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone , you know , in that , uh , in that range .
