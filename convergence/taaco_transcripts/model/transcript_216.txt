All right . Okay . Well , I can go ahead and start and tell you mine and , Okay . We 're from San Antonio and that 's where I grew up , Oh , So I was used to the heat , out here right now , Yeah . Gosh , it gets to about seventies , high seventies and it gets very cold at night . Uh-huh . And Monterey it 's , um , right on the coast . And , I do n't know if you 're familiar with California coastline , but we 're we 're about two hours , about a two hour drive south of San Francisco , 

Oh , okay . And it 's , uh , really nice . It 's a big area for people to come from the different , uh , countries , mostly like Japan , Germany and England . And they usually go to Carmel and vacation on the beaches , so it 's , it 's pretty nice , uh , year round . But , uh , cool , always cool in the evenings . And warm , warm in the Summer , but it 's stays pretty cold even , uh , during the Winter , for as nice as it is . Uh-huh . And , um , we usually get a fog . Uh , right about , I guess , about four o'clock and it kind of rolls in over the coast . And , uh , then it usually breaks back off again the next morning . And if you go just a little bit ways in , I 'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas , Uh-huh . uh , the weather completely changes and it gets very hot and dry and the fog never makes it that far . Uh-huh . But along here it 's , uh , very , very different from the Texas type weather . What 's it like down there ? Well , right now we 're we 're having the little bit of Spring that we have . Oh , really , well at least you 've got some . 

We do n't have many seasons here . It goes from Winter to Summer , usually . Uh-huh . Spring usually consists of a lot of rain . Especially thunderstorms . We 've got , we had one of those blow through tonight . Oh , well , that 's good . And I think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days . Uh-huh . So . Have y'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree , It 's gotten up to , uh , ninety a couple of times . Uh-huh . But , basically , it 's been in the low seventies and eighties . Uh-huh . Women , that 's good . For this time of year . Yeah . 

It 's not really been too bad . Uh-huh . Usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier . Uh-huh . So do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year ? Yeah , 

quite a bit . Oh , Uh-huh . Well , the season is just about over for that , uh , in fact we drove down to Corpus last week -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way . Oh , I miss that . 

MUMBLEx drove through San Antonio and I spoke to somebody else this morning from San Antonio and were , they had , and we came back . What day was that , Sunday evening , and they had a big rainstorm come through there , part of the same thing we 're getting now , I guess . Oh . Oh , well that 's real nice because I can remember two years ago that in about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just continued . 

At least y'all are getting some rain up in Dallas . I 'm glad to hear that . Yeah . That 's the second or third year in a row that we 've had a real rainy Spring . Uh-huh . 

We had a pretty rainy Fall last year , as well . Y'all were n't getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were you ? Um , we 've had a few down here , but not anything like Kansas . Uh-huh . But this is the season for that . 

Oh , gosh . They do , they do pop up occasionally , Uh-huh . around here . Oh . Yeah . I really do n't miss all the heat there . Yeah . 

I 'm getting acclimated to have the cool evenings so we get a bit of a relief . Yeah . I 'm from here originally , 

so when it 's July and August , I 'm pretty well used to the , Uh-huh . hundred degree temperatures . Uh-huh . Yeah . The biggest problem with , with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil . It 's that black clay soil . Oh . Is that what Dallas is , okay . Yeah . You know , it 's not sandy like most of the state is , so it does n't absorb the water real well . Uh-huh . You know , once it rains a little bit , it 's , it 's filled up and everything else just runs off , Uh-huh . you know . Yeah . 

San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come . It 's , it 's a complete mess , everything floods , all the under passes . Yeah . I did n't realize that Dallas had that same problem . Yeah . We have it , especially as rainy as it 's been in the last couple of years . 

And there 's a section in South Dallas that 's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain . Uh-huh . Well , we could use some rain up here . We 're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought , Really . up here and they had a pretty good early Spring and we got quite a bit of rain , but it was n't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years . Uh-huh . And , uh , so they 're still talking water rationing this Summer , so it would seem strange because in San Antonio , we had lived out , um , west of San Antonio , in Castroville , Uh-huh . And the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down , that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing and I thought oh , gee I 'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the California Pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers and there 's no problem with water . And then I came here and found out they were in the , you know , four year draught . Uh-huh . So I said , well , gee , this is pretty much like Texas . And it pretty much is in the middle of Summer . They have rolling hills around here but , Uh-huh . um , they turn to golden dead grass , Uh-huh . for the majority of the Summer just because there is no water to keep them green . Yeah . But , um , it 's a really nice area . It 's just , it 's just such a change from , uh , Texas because I had grown up with , uh , the heat , Uh-huh . and used to essentially , like you said , you have the cold Winter and then you have the hot Summer Spring . Uh-huh . And , uh , to come here , it 's kind of the temperate weather all year round . It 's kind of like , uh , Spring , I guess , if you , year round , except , and then in the Winter and then it seems sort of like a San Antonio early Winter or Fall , Uh-huh . year-round . So it seems like we only have two Springs which is , or two seasons and that would be Spring and Fall . Yeah . We never really get any of the other ones . Uh-huh . But it 's a really nice , uh , change of pace . I guess I 'd prefer that . Yeah . To the heat . I really do n't miss the heat . Yeah . Um , we do a lot of , you know , when you do a lot of outside , like running and stuff , it 's just so much easier , Uh-huh . up here and you do n't have to worry about the high humidity . Yeah . Does Dallas get high humidity ? Or is it pretty dry . It 's pretty dry . We get some when it 's this rainy , but it 's nothing like , I guess , San Antonio Summers , it 's nothing like Houston . Uh-huh . MUMBLEx or East Texas , is a little more humid . Yeah . 

It seems like San Antonio is increasing in humidity over the years , because I had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years , Uh-huh . and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid , more and more humid . Uh-huh . And here it 's , uh , well it 's right by the ocean , but , um , it 's not the same as Corpus . Corpus , you get that humid salty feeling in the air . Uh-huh . But here , um , well the water is extremely cold , up here , you can lay on the beach all you want , but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming , you have to wear a wet suit . Uh-huh . And a thick wet suit at that , because it 's just extremely cold and I , for some reason , because of the cold , uh , ocean , uh , water , the air is always cool . It 's never humid or sticky or salty feeling , so I really like that about this area . And , uh , we just had n't expected it , we were used to , what , uh , gulf coast weather was like , Yeah . when we came here to Pacific coast weather . It 's just completely different and it 's much nicer . Yeah . 

Probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference , Uh-huh . It does and the air does n't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region . But you , um , but we like it so it 's a nice change . So we 'll be here a couple of years and we thought well , we 'll take advantage of it and see what all the Pacific coast is like . That 's nice . So it 's been good . Well , my wife 's originally from Virginia and we lived there for about nine months and that was a real change for me . 

Oh , I imagine . Virginia , I imagine , gets real humid , does n't it ? Um , parts do . We , we 're over in the western edge in the mountains . Oh . And , they have , of course , some pretty severe storms , Winter storms , snow and that type of thing . Uh-huh . 

But they 're so good about clearing the roads , that , you know , it does n't usually bother you very much . Uh-huh . Yeah . Not like Texas where everything comes to a stand still . Yeah . Their Springs and Summers are pretty mild , too . It never gets real , real hot . Uh-huh . I 'll have to try that out because I had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that . Uh-huh . And , uh , I 've just never really been in that region of the country and I guess I 'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it 's like . Because a lot of people that are from that North Carolina region really like it . And , uh , they get the snow , but they said it does n't really get messy and it does n't really hang around that long . Yeah . So , they , the people I know that are from there , uh , they always miss it and they want to go back . 

Nothing seems quite as good . But , anyway . Well , Well , as we were talking the weather came on 

and there 's a flash flood watch and , Oh , gee-whiz . more rain for the next three or four days . Oh , gosh . Well , I hope it moves up this way , 

but I 'm sure it wo n't . Yeah . Maybe we can send you some . Yeah . Because we could sure use it . 

Well , you think that takes care of the time and , I think that will do it . Okay . Well , I sure appreciate hearing how things are going in Texas and , uh , Well , I enjoyed talking with you Lisa , Yeah . Good luck to you . Uh-huh . You , too . Okay . 

We 'll see you . Bye . Bye .
