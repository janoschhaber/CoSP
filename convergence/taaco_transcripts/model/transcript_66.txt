Okay . So are you a freshwater or , Mostly freshwater , I -- Freshwater , 

-- yeah , I , I used to fish , uh , when I was real young , down in Galveston with my parents , and I never really got into that too much , because you have to get in the boat really to do anything , and I did n't know anybody who had a boat now , so I do n't fish too much in saltwater . Uh-huh . Most of my fishing has been in the saltwater . Oh , really , Uh , mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish -- Oh , neat , -- and , uh , I have caught one or two small sharks -- Oh , really . -- and , uh , yes . 

What 'd you do with them ? Put them back . You did n't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do ? No , no , no , I love shark steak , but , uh , the ones I caught were never large enough to really do anything . Do they have a limit on sharks , 

I mean , is that like a , a sport fish , can you actually catch those and there 's no limit . Is there a limit ? I have no idea . I know , I , 

my home is in , uh , Pensacola , Florida -- Uh-huh . -- so , it 's , they do a lot of shark fishing in that , you know , in the gulf -- Right . -- and , um , there 's a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf coast from , I guess from Galveston to Mayport they have , uh , shark tournaments , and , you know , there 's part , either as part of or separate from the , uh , bill fishing tournaments they usually have -- Right . -- so , I have not done , uh , much freshwater fishing -- 

Oh , really . -- oh , for , you know , lake , lake fishing for bass and so forth -- Right . -- but , uh , maybe some what they call brim -- Uh-huh . -- and those sorts of things , but nothing , I think I 've been trout fishing once . I 've never fly fished . Have you fly fished ? Uh , no I have n't . 

I do n't know that I could do that . That looks awful tiring . I 've tried it -- 

Did you . -- once , yes , uh , a friend of mine -- Did n't like it ? 

-- no . I could never get the hang of it . It looks complicated to me . It 's a rhythm or something . Uh-huh . I usually ended snagging my , uh , fishing partners or the trees along the bank . Catching tree bass , right . Yes . Almost got an owl once . Did you . 

That would have been something . But , uh . So do you , do you fish mainly for trophies or do you , do you eat what you fish . 

Oh , no , no , no , no . I used , uh , when I was , uh , working in Florida , I used to do a lot of surf fishing -- Uh-huh . -- mostly for relaxation -- Right . -- you know , there are people who fish , and then there are people who catch . Right . Well , I 'm a fisher . You just like to sit down and watch it , right . 

That 's right , I 've never caught that much , but , uh , Really . Oh , and occasionally we 'd go out on a , you know , full day trip , you know , three or four other people -- Right . -- and do either , again , bottom fishing or -- Right . -- or for grouper or , I used to catch you know , I 've caught a few worthwhile snappers , red snappers and gray snappers and so forth . That 's nice . What about you , you a , 

Well , most of my fishing is done at , um , area lakes around here , freshwater lakes -- Uh-huh . -- and , um , most of it , I have n't been really in a long time . Last time I went I actually was in Galveston trying to saltwater fish and it just was n't working with my freshwater tackle . That was real fun . Um , but , um , I went fishing at , I do n't know if you 've ever heard of , uh , Lake Worth . It 's a fairly new lake in Texas . Oh , yes . And , uh , we went fishing there last memorial day , and I caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep . I was so excited . 

And , uh , that 's really about it . Mostly just the lakes around here , and I fish to take home and cook . I do n't , I do n't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching . I get a little bit of relaxation from it , but mainly I , um , I want to say I brought something home . I want to say I did this , I was out there for a reason . The last time I went , uh , bass fishing , I was with my daughter , a friend of hers , and , well , a friend of mine and his daughter . We , I was the only one who did not catch , a single fish -- Really . -- my daughter caught fish , his daughter caught fish , he caught fish . Everybody but you . I did not even , I did not even , I have been , I was out on a party boat a few years ago , and we , we were grouper fishing , or , you know , actually we were , uh , snapper fishing . Everyone on the boat was catching snapper , snappers except guess who . It had to be you . 

I ca- , I , Could n't catch one to save your life . Huh . That 's right , I would go from one side of the boat to the other , 

and , uh , the , uh , the party boat captain could not understand , you know , he even , even he started baiting my hook , and holding , holding the , uh , the fishing rod . How funny , just hoping maybe , he could pull . Right , and it was , it was really , really , really bad . Uh , I , as I said , I am a fisher , 

I 'm not a catcher . Right . But , uh , I enjoy it though . I do n't really get out as much as I , uh , as I would like too . Yeah . And they do , of course , you know , here in , we 're only just a few , not a few minutes , we 're , you know , forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in Maryland -- Right . -- and they do a lot of fishing there . Of course what I used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops -- Oh , yeah , -- in some of the bays , or uh , or oy- , for oysters . That would be fun . And , uh , that I was able to do , when I could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom . Right . Hand picked . That right . 

The weirdest fishing experience I ever had . People to this day are still trying to figure out if I really caught what I think I caught . We were in , uh , Rockport , which is close to Corpus -- Uh-huh . -- and we had been fishing in a canal , they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area , and , uh , we 'd been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish , and we were pretty bored with that . So , we thought well , maybe there are some crab in here , we 'll try to catch some crab . So I got my chicken MUMBLEx and all my little net and everything , and something , I had a rock to weight it down , something grabs and just runs with it . And of course there 's no hook , so it ca n't be a fish . Uh-huh . I 'm sure it 's not a fish , right . And crab , they do n't bite like that , they do n't just run with your food . So , I netted it , and it was the ugliest fish I 've ever seen in my life . It had real teeth , like human teeth , and it looked archaic . I , I had no idea what it was . I called my father long distance just to describe the thing , and it had the rock in its mouth , not the chicken , but the rock itself -- Um . -- is what it had grabbed . They say it 's a dog fish , from everything I 've described , it was brown with these little white dots -- Uh-huh . -- and it made a loud , almost a croaking noise like a croaker does -- Uh-huh . -- it , it was the strangest thing . Oh , I 'll never get over that . To this day I do n't want to get in the water , anywhere around salt water because I 'm sure one of those fish are there . Well , we used to , I guess the weirdest thing I 've ever caught is , uh , in some of the inlets and the rivers around MUMBLEx Delaware . Uh-huh . They have a fish that 's called an oyster cracker . I do n't know if you 've ever heard of it -- 

I 've never heard of that one . -- and it has a huge strong mouth , and they actually , uh , use their teeth to open oysters . 

That 's where it gets its name , obviously , huh . Uh-huh , and this is the ugliest , fish I have ever seen , and I mean , and they come in all si- , you know , I 've , I 've caught them from , you know , three or four inches long -- Uh-huh . -- up to , uh , I guess the largest one I ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long , but just huge , ugly things -- Huh . -- just terrible . Can you eat them ? No , no . Ooh . 

I , I do n't think I 'd want to even if you could if they 're that ugly , but . They just , they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them . That 's like this dog fish , it was , it scared me to death . Uh-huh . It was u- , it really , it did n't look like , it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died . 

Well , the first time I went surf fishing was in MUMBLEx , and I threw my line out and the first thing I caught was a sand shark , which was probably a foot , and a half or , uh , two feet long , and scared me to death . Oh . I had never seen anything , and then I was fi , fished for another half hour or forty-five minutes , caught a few white fish and so forth , and then I felt something relatively heavy , and I thought , oh , really , here , I 'm really going to get one . And I ,
