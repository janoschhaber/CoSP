My T V down . Okay . I 'm sorry . Uh , invasions of privacy . Uh-huh . Uh , what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things . Uh-huh . All , Uh-huh . sorts of hours calling and telling me that I want investment advise and I want this service and that service or the other thing . Yes . 

I hate those canned messages they put on my recorder . Um , my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen MUMBLEx just what went into the MUMBLEx something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers . Uh-huh . I guess in some cases they just consider pickup your , your phone and , and , and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not . Uh-huh . Um , but I thought I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using and , uh , and , uh , people , businesses would be prohibited , uh , from calling for pers- , for , for business MUMBLEx selling you things . I have through , 

I 'm sure that 's true . the phone company , uh , no nine hundred numbers can be dialed from my phone or received . 

Uh , some of MUMBLEx did too . I think , I think government can do that now , is that right ? Uh-huh . And , uh , especially with , with possibly children around . Uh-huh . Uh , that could , could be useful protection . Right . Yes , and I do n't have children around but I just do n't like those nine hundred numbers . So , So , uh , I used to deal with , I 've excluded those . But is n't , it does not stop you from the , uh , dialing services . 

What are dialing services ? Where they , uh , intend to sell you things . Oh , oh , where people just , just call you . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . And leave again that canned message on the , And you know , and then what , those problems has been eliminated 

those problems used to be when I used a credit card -- Uh-huh . -- they 'd want to have my phone number . Uh-huh . And I did not like giving it out . I MUMBLEx gave out my work number -- Right . -- but I think I 'm not sure if it 's by law just , otherwise I think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number . Well , that 's the thing I hated too about , uh , Radio Shack . How did Radio Shack work ? If you go in and buy anything they want your phone number . And I do n't think they 're going to call me and ask me how it 's functioning , and , and I do n't give that out . I have an unlisted number so I do n't , Yes , that 's , that 's , that 's one solution 

but you , you , you nonetheless often get , get people calling you ? Sure . Despite the fact that your number is unlisted ? Uh-huh . And you MUMBLEx actually have your number or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours ? Well , anything that you buy -- Uh-huh . 

-- um , you ca- , you may get put on the , a , uh , preferred list that is purchased . Uh-huh . And , and companies can purchase this list and what that is is people who buy from the mail . Yeah , and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers . Uh-huh . I 'll be thinking in mind the address is , um , is there anything you can do about that like -- Uh , no . -- give out a phony phone number ? Not really . Um , no . Uh , some of that unfortunately is legal . So they ca n't stop people from , uh , advertising and that , and that 's what it falls under . It falls under the guise of advertising . So , I do n't care for it , but is it a legal , uh , solution for some companies . So that , that 's the way things are . 

Huh . Yeah . I do n't know . I think it 's gotten much worse the last , Uh-huh . Uh-huh . few years . Maybe that 's just because I 've gotten on more lists . Well , they , you know , 

that 's , that 's the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy . You 've got the holy rollers and you 've got , uh , all kinds of people knocking on your door and , who want to , uh , either direct you to the right path or , or want to , uh , sell you , uh , paper routes , uh , whatever , so , um , Yeah . 

Sell you magazines . you know , it 's not just the telephone . Uh-huh . I guess whatever is , I just do n't give ,
