Okay , should begin . Okay . All right . Uh , I can begin this , um , basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis -- Uh-huh . -- and the , the benefit program we have here is really quite good . I 'm , I 'm pretty pleased with it . They cover , uh , just about everything , vision , dental , medical -- Uh-huh . -- uh , you name it , and for me this is the first job I 've had where they 've covered that much , so I 'm pretty satisfied myself . Uh-huh . Um , what 's your situation ? 

I work for the University of New Hampshire , and -- Oh . -- uh , our benefits package is n't , uh , is n't quite as good in some ways . Uh , you know , overall I 'm satisfied with it . We do n't have the vision care , we do have the health care and the , uh , and the medi- , or the dental . Uh-huh . Uh . 

Are you a professor there ? No , I work in , I 'm a , on the professional administrative and technical staff , and I , effectively I run the telephone switch at , uh , at the University of New Hampshire . Oh , I see , okay . Uh , so the , uh , the benefits , uh , probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the , uh , the , uh , very generous vacation time and sick time . 

Oh , no doubt . We get fifteen days a year sick time , and , uh , we get twenty-four days a year , right from the day one when you start work , you get twenty-four days a year , uh , time off . Right . Well , that 's good . Yeah . Yeah , 

that 's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell , is , uh , I used to work with the Army Research Institute , and being a , uh , a government organization you got quite a few holidays off . Right . But here you do n't get that . You maybe get two or three a year . Uh-huh . So it 's really , unless you , unless you have some vacation time or some , some sick leave or whatever , um , you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time . Uh-huh . So , that 's , that 's kind of a drawback I think . But , uh . I do n't know . What do you consider most important , you think , in terms of , of the different benefits ? Well , I think , uh , the , the health care , of course , is an important , and has to be the single most important benefit -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing , uh -- Yeah . 

-- you know , I 'm , I 'm a little disturbed about that , but I think that 's a national trend , and I do n't know that , uh , I do n't know what the solution is to it . It 's bigger than just the benefits part . Yeah , I do n't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night , they , uh , they basically reviewed Oregon 's plan -- Uh-huh . -- or The Oregon Plan -- Right . -- toward , uh , nationalizing health care and that kind of thing . It 's kind of an interesting plan . It 's kind of cold though . They 've essentially made up a list of , uh , oh , all the different , uh , medical maladies that you can have -- Oh , yeah . -- and then basically made a cutoff , about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by , by , uh , subsidized health care , and the ones above would . Um . So it 's kind of like drawing this line and , and if you have it great , if you do n't , you 're kind of out of luck -- Uh-huh . -- but , um , it was kind of an interesting show . Um . I think you 're right , I think health care is probably the , the most pressing -- Right . -- uh , the pressing one , but I 'll tell you , I , I do n't mind having dental , you know , sometimes dental costs can be , um , just about as expensive , if not more , and I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical -- Uh-huh . -- but I 'm not sure that 's , that 's widely followed any more . I 'm not sure , how , how does , uh , University of New Hampshire handle it ? 

Well , we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental , uh , depending , and , and the cost between them is very , is very little . I think it costs me something like five dollars a , a month for the dental plan . Um . But it pays , uh , a substantial amount . I mean , the examinations and , and , uh , checkups every year , or every six months are free -- Great . -- and , uh , it , it covers the bulk of the dental expenses . Is that , uh , let me interrupt , is that the same for both , uh , professors and , and also staff and administration , is that generally across the board , do you think or , 

Uh , yes , it is . The benefits plan is different for operating , for what we call operating staff , which are considered to be , uh , clerical personnel , accountants , things like that -- Right . -- as opposed to what they call the P A T staff , which I belong to -- Uh-huh . -- but the main , I think the , the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody , and the retirement plan . But -- Uh-huh . -- the main difference is in the , uh , the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued . Oh , okay . Uh , for the operating staff it 's on a seniority , it 's , you know , based on how long they 've worked there . Right . That determines how much , uh , vacation time they get . Yeah , I 'm kind of interested because I 'm actually , that 's the route I 'd like to take when I finally get my degree -- Uh-huh . 

-- is to , uh , is to teach in a university . Uh-huh . I 'm a doctoral student in Florida right now -- Oh . -- but , uh , yeah , that 's , that 's interesting . That 's one of the things I 'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would , uh , they would cover and things like that . College programs belong to this T I A A , uh , C R E F retirement fund . Oh , is that right ? Right , and in the case of the University of New Hampshire , uh ,
