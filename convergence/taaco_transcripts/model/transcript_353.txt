Well , uh , and that 's an idea that 's been around for , kicked around for a long time . I do n't know that it 's ever been seriously considered , uh , as far as close to passing , uh , any legislation or anything like that . But , uh , I believe Israel does that , do n't they for their , Uh , yes , I think so . Uh , Wel- , everybody has to do , has to do something . Yeah , I do n't kn , Or maybe , maybe theirs is , in fact , one year of military service for everyone . But , uh , Yeah , I believe that 's right . Okay . 

And , uh , and I do n't know that that 's really what we 're talking about . No , I do n't think it 's , it 's necessa , n- , I think of that . It , it could n't be . Military service is not that much but , the , m- , military used to do it but the idea that , uh , there are things that , that do need to be done that could be done and then , uh , country would benefit from one year from , from everybody and even out the , the , uh , Yeah , for , requirement . for kids in high school , it could be in the summertime . 

Well , now that 's a thought . Yeah . Uh , you know , um , it , it could even be done while they 're doing another job , Yeah . while they 're doing , you know , a job to make money . But , uh , it 's , uh , you know , such a grassroots idea that it , I think the family would have to be involved in it . Uh-huh . And people would have to be convinced that , you know , I , I think the , the basic message is that giving is better than receiving . Yeah , right . And that 's not the kind of society we have right now . Oh , yeah , I 'm afraid you 're right there . But , uh , but , uh , anything like this that came up whether it , it quickly would be significant industry in , in figuring out how to get around it where people , There 's lots and lots of volunteer programs and , uh , Yeah . but most of those are at l , least it , it 's my opinion that most of those involve adults . Uh-huh . Adults who have the time to give and , and , uh , you know , the desire -- Uh-huh . -- to , to give . Yeah . 

It 's not , uh , you know it 's not , uh , maybe the , maybe it cou- , uh , younger people feel like it 's not open to them , I do n't know . But it should be if it 's not . Yeah . Uh , I suspect that the- , yeah , that , that , that that 's not the thing . That they , that they do n't feel it 's open to them it 's just that they , uh , are more self-centered if you will and not , not considering , Yeah , a voluntary MUMBLEx , it is kind of an introspective time of life . Yeah . But some schools , some high schools have actually started a program of like a visitation program to , uh , you know , areas economically , uh -- Uh-huh . -- say less advantaged areas . Uh-huh . And , uh , they , they promote service on the part of the kids to , to , uh , some of those people . So at least that 's a step in the right direction I guess . Yeah . yeah . And , uh , now I didn , I do n't know it di , I , I think you 're right that that 's not the , not the way that the society these days is going , and I , I think we need to , we need to try to figure out some way to , to turn that around that everybody , It 's really , it 's really unfortunate because when you do , I do volunteer work for the American Lung Association . Huh . And I have , have done , uh , gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society . And there 's , there 's no question that doing , you know , doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than , uh , than the people involved . Yeah . Uh , it 's , it 's really a gift to yourself and , and that 's , I think that 's a really important lesson to learn . Yeah . And , and maybe that 's why we have so many people in society who are not , uh , not really happy , you know . 

Well , that could be . Because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself , you 're just kind of down the tube , you know . Yeah , right . Uh , it really is better to give then to receive . Yeah , I , I agree with that , 

and , uh , and I , I , I do n't know what , what has , what has set it off or what but i- , it , it certainly seems to me that , that , uh , uh , things in , in the last twenty-three years , uh , things hav , have definitely gone towards , uh , very much the concentration on self and , and loss of , loss of perspective in terms ,
