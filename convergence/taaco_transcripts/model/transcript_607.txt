Uh , I 've had , uh , three boys through , I guess , uh , some child care , each one of them and now they 're in school so it 's all over but , uh , I guess I would say it 's not easy to find wha , what most parents would want . 

Well I can profit by this because I 'm due with my first in about three months . Is that right . I guess , uh , the only rule , uh , I can think of is that I like to look for places with , uh , good respectable , nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that . If they 're associated with a college or a university , they 're usually a pretty good bet . Huh . Uh , I think it 's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something . You 'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care . I guess not , usu- , I suppose you 're absolutely right there . Yeah . For profit -- Uh-huh . 

-- places , I would really look at them awfully carefully but , uh , when I was when my kids were young , I was teaching at a university and , uh , the child care center associated with our university was quite good so -- Uh-huh . -- I felt confident that they 'd do right . Of , are n't do n't they kind of use them for , everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs ? For their per- , for their pet theories or some such thing ? Yes . But , yeah , I suppose , uh , if you 're , if there is a psychology department or an education department around , you might find you might find that they 're pushing one form of education or another , I guess that 's true . But , uh , I never had bad experience in that respect . Of course , you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents , and they , you know , pretty good people . Um . Well , the thing I really worry about is , uh , the sexual abuse cases you read about . Uh-huh . And I mean you 'd just feel awful if something like that happened . Yeah . 

I never really worry very much about it . I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public so , I -- Uh-huh . -- never really worried too much about that being , uh , uh , the case with my boys . Oh . Uh , I , you know , I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them but -- Uh-huh . -- I do n't think it 's as common as , uh , the newspapers would make you believe . Uh-huh . And another thing is cost . Oh , yeah . I mean that , 

I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now and they finding , in some cases they 're finding it 's just not worth it to work because it 's all going out in daycare . Right . Um . Well , in our case , we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were , uh , in school . And I 'm really happy we did it , although it was very , very difficult . And -- Um . -- I think it was the right thing to do and we were , uh , we just decided that we would do it and we went ahead but , uh , not everybody can make that choice and even , even though my wife was n't working , we did have , uh , one or another of the boys in , uh , child care for part-ti- , just for part of the day . Uh , or a couple of days a week just so that , uh , other things could get done around the house and so on , so , Huh . So , we did look around . 

I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not and , uh -- Huh . -- so I would always trust her judgment on that . Huh . Well I 'm just thanking heaven . My husband just got a new job . His last company , he was only working four days a week . Uh-huh . So it 's , and he just got a new job . He 's getting lots of overtime , he got a pay raise 

and so I 'm just grateful that we do n't have to worry so much about my working or not . There 's absolutely no question that you 're going to be the best child care provider for that kid so , yeah , do it as long you can . I suppose . But I think , you know , you have to look through a place and you have to get a feel for , uh , how they treat the kids and , uh , uh , what kind of staff members they have and -- Uh-huh . -- how much turnover they have and things like that before you -- Uh-huh . -- commit your child to them . And I think you have , the main thing is that you have to determine that they 're perfectly open . That you 're welcome anytime without notice , in the middle of the day and so forth and if they 're at all queasy about that then -- You have to start wondering if they do n't want you . -- I 'd look elsewhere , yeah . Yes . Right . Huh . You have other friends that have kids , uh , being taken care of in , uh , child care ? Uh , I have one but I have n't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while . Uh-huh . So . But , I really think the news reports are , uh , tend to sensationalize the problems . Uh-huh . I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and , uh , pay and exhaustion and , you know , things like that , rather than these , uh , uh , really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy . This is true . Yeah . CURRENT AFFAIR can , get several shows MUMBLEx child cases . 

Uh-huh . Well ,
