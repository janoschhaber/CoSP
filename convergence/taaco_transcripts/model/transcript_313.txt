The AIDS issue is , is a bit of a problem . I guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem , is , is the financial end . And how can a country stand to , uh , spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem , uh , but , then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the , the knowledge , or at least the , the rumor , I 'm not really sure if it 's true or not , that , uh , we 're not spending as much per , let 's say , afflicted person on cancer . Uh , there 's some , uh , take breast cancer , for instance . It seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more pe- , many more people than AIDS . And yet , uh , more people die of it , and yet the funding has already , uh , exceeded , AIDS has more money than , uh , breast cancer . Than , well , that 's interesting , is n't it , yeah . So , uh , I mean , if it 's true . I , I 've , I 've always heard these things . I 've never bothered to dig it out and make sure , but , uh , I 've heard it on more than one documentary that , uh , they were complaining that whoever 's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and , uh , it 's just one big P R campaign that , yeah , we think that 's the world 's worst thing so let 's give money to AIDS . And yet we 've had breast cancer problems for years . Right . And , it 's just one of those , uh , course , one of the shows I saw was taking it from the angle that , since it does n't effect men , it 's not going to get funded . And , uh , having thought about that for a while , What did you think about that idea ? Well , I , I kind of , I thought , well , that , that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing . But then I got , I got to thinking , the , the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there 's only one test that just recently got developed , uh , a blood in- , antigen , uh , antibody test for the antigen in the blood and that 's fairly recent . And yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years . They 've not really given it attention either , yeah . So it 's not really cured , yeah , it 's not , uh , not that heavily funded either and then that seems to be one of the , the major , uh , problems that men have in the realm of cancer , so , I do n't know . I , I guess there 's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to . Uh , be it through different organizations , March of Dimes type , uh , telethons or , or bicycle rides or whatever , how they fund whatever , uh , illness they wish . Right . It 's kind of hard to , to get an even keel on that . I mean , it 's really hard to say , well , there 's , you know , a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let 's give it this amount , and then this other one 's only a tenth of that , so give it a tenth of that and , and just keep doling it out that way or , 

Well , I 'm , I 'm glad I 'm not the one that 's , that 's in charge of , of making those decisions . They , uh , you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they 're all so serious , you know . I mean it 's not so serious , I guess , until it affects your family and then all of a sudden it 's the most important thing . Right . So I , I would hate to have that responsibility just personally but , but then , again , we really , we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address . I , uh , I guess I , it , it frightens me to think of so many people with , with AIDS and with cancer and many of those things , uh , if they 're not able to , to be insured then the country 's going to pay for it one way or the other . Right . Whether it 's through prevention or , or treatment or , you know , just , uh , just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves . It seems like one way or the other we 're going to end up paying for it . 

That 's true . But , You know the , the other thought that I had , uh , I 've had several minutes to think about this after I , uh , while I was finding people , I , uh , I could think about the topic longer that the person that receives it , so it 's kind of a , a unfair advantage , as it were , but , the other thing that I thought of on this is , I wonder if there is n't enough money , uh , in our economy or in our system . Uh , it seems like there 's so much that goes to things that do n't really do a whole lot of good . I mean , yeah , they 're kind of nice . But , we have such an affluent a- , society , society that I wonder if , if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a , a cure for just about everything . Just change our p- , Of course , then we would n't have any room to put people , 

but that 's , Right , just change our priorities -- Yeah . -- a little bit . You know , you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these , these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this , that or the other and then you have all the arts that , that are nice and aesthetic , but -- Right . -- are they that enhancing for the , for the masses , you know . They certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that , but , uh , had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else ,
