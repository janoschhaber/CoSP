Well , on this subject of invasion of privacy , yes , it 's very easy for anybody to find out about you . Your , Well , I do n't really like that very much . Yeah , uh , 

the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast , I think , last week or so ago , it detailed how this one person went about finding out this particular pers- , from this particular person his home mortgage , how much he pays for it , what his payments are , uh , his , uh , Social Security number , driver 's license , any kind of records he may have . Uh , their credit card and the status of their credit . What was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff ? It was just as a demonstration to show -- Oh . -- those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person . 

And it was , mostly it dealt with , uh , marketing companies , these , uh , direct marketing , Oh , yeah . associations . Uh-huh . 

That was the primary subject . That 's how they obtain information about segments of society and group them into age brackets , uh , their habits , their hobbies , their income . Um . And they 're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer . Well , that , that 's not really good . I do n't know , I guess that 's an invasion of privacy . I 'm not sure that that 's an everyday thing , though , at least not for , you know , an individual . Uh-huh . Something that I feel is a , is a , pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that 's really so common that it 's accepted as the norm now , is the op , the open office concept . 

The open office ? Uh-huh , where they have the , you know , the little partition dividers , Yeah . throughout a , a large room and , and people have little cubicles . Well , that 's all fine and good , but you do n't really have any privacy at all . 

Not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody , I suppose , because it , you can easily be overhear , overheard -- Right . -- and they get , I suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen . Yeah . Yeah , there 's , there is , And , and it 's not , it 's not just that , 

it 's , uh , the whole thing about , you know , if , if you 're trying to concentrate , well , it 's rather hard , sometimes it 's almost impossible to do -- Uh-huh . -- because , um , you know , your , uh , your time , your space is , is not your own space . Uh-huh . And I work in a situation like that and I , I really kind of have a problem with that . Do you work with , uh , mixed company , male and female or , Oh , yeah . Is there anybody who does n't ? Well , there are a few out there . Um . It 's , I suppose it depends on who you 're working for and where at . Yeah . But , um , my own environment is open totally . There are no cubicles . 

There 's nothing to block anything . Um . So , yeah , but , um , I guess we 're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody 's record , Yeah . or the computers , the , the big advent of that , I believe , because it , they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button and it appears -- Uh-huh . -- in front of them , and you do n't have to , I , I know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families . Uh-huh . That 's no secret , and it should n't be that way I do n't think . Yeah , I do n't , I do n't think that 's , that 's quite right either . I mean it 's not really government for the people and by the people , I 'll tell you that . Yeah . So , 

Hum , what do you think could be done about it ? Uh , the only way it can change is , um , if , if everybody bands together . It 's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that 's serving in the office . The only thing really that can be changed is for us to , everybody to say , we 've had enough of you , out you go . But , uh , I do n't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that . Uh-huh . It has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done . Um , I do n't know , it 's , it 's still a , a free , I suppose , country insofar as we 're , we 're able to obtain information . And I would n't be for total banning of , uh , all information or , it 's mostly the private information that we 're all concerned about . But it 's , it 's hard to define -- Yeah . -- uh , a lot of those boundaries . 

It really is . It 's something that , something that I 've just had a , a dealing with is like a credit bureau . Uh-huh . Well , they take , they take my name , which is a very common name , and my last name is even more common -- Uh-huh . -- and they they check that name against , uh , their list and they find several . And without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all , they just report everything under that name . So you 've received a lot of , uh , flack ? 

They do n't , they do n't even check my Social Security number . Um . And companies are paying them good money to report accurately , and they 're not , they 're so lazy . They 're just not doing it . I mean they just find your name and they match it up . Uh-huh . You know , and that just drives me crazy because they 're , and then they want , then , you know , to get it removed they say , well , you know , you have to write this , write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them , you know , and then it takes three weeks and all . And I 'm like , baloney . Uh-huh . You messed it up , you fix it . 

Is that usually what you tell them in the letter ? No , what I 've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report -- Uh-huh . -- like , uh , uh , recently I was reported as having J C Penney accounts and I do n't . So I called J C Penney and I said , uh , I just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you 're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you 're providing to them . And they say , uh-huh , because they really do n't want to pay for a service that 's not being done properly either . Uh-huh . So then they can call the credit bureau and say , hey , you know , we 're paying you good money to report this properly and you 're not doing your job . Good idea . So that 's what I 've taken to doing lately , and it seems to work pretty well so far . Uh-huh . Well , that 's good . Uh , any other problems ? Not that I can think of . Yeah , I , I guess I 've just about run out of , Yeah . I , I can probably go on , but it 's , it 's , uh , I 'm clouding up right now . Oh , yeah , I probably better let you get back to work . Well , it 's nice talking to you . Okay . Maybe again . All rightie . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
