Arlington , Texas now since I got somebody from Arlington , Virginia one day . Is that right ? . Yeah . Well , I never thought about that , but there is an Arlington , like I had a call the other day from Birmingham , Michigan -- Oh -- 

-- you know , and I was thinking -- -- Birmingham . -- yeah , and I was thinking the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama . Right . 

It 's funny how many names have been used , uh , all over the country . Yeah , well , tell me what kind of books have you read ? Well , to tell you the truth , I 've been going to college for the last four years so mainly , text books . I was going to say , not fun kind , right ? No , um , but , I , I really tend to like biographies a lot , not necessarily always heavy ones -- Uh-huh . -- but , you know , sometimes biogr- , I just read one about Grace Kelley . I love to read about real people . To me , half the time it 's more fascinating than some of these made up stories . Yeah , 

it is , because you know that 's it 's really and truly -- Yeah , it happened . -- a true thing . You know , I read one about Bob Hope that I liked . Really ? Yeah , that was real good . I 'm like you , if it 's not a heavy biography , you know -- Right . -- I enjoy it . 

I used to like to read about royalty a lot . I , when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived , I think , in Europe . That was my thing for a while . I was trying to think , uh , I read a , uh , a novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all , and there was a murder . Oh , really . Yeah , it was some time ago . Seems like it was THE SPY WENT DANCING , or something like that . Oh , it sounds like fun . It was a lot of fun because they used these real names , you know . 

Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers , you know Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those . Yeah , in fact I believe it was because , Really ? Uh-huh . I believe . 

Sounds like something she would write . Yeah , I think it was by her , now that you mention it , because someone had given it to me , and I thought , well , this will be great , and it was . Yeah , 

I 've heard that she 's done real- , you know , her books are really interesting , and they always sell well . Uh-huh . And , uh , Well , when you use real people like that , I think -- Yeah , brings it to life . -- royalty , especially , you know . I know , uh , the Bri- , some of the British people laugh at us because we 're so enthralled with their royalty . Yeah , 

but you know , that 's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth , you know . I know , our movie stars . Our movie stars , because it 's totally different concept to us . Oh , right . I have n't , I have n't had a chance to read a lot lately either . I have read , uh , mostly novels . I went to visit my daughter in Florida -- Um . -- and I took a novel with me , uh , and read it at Thanksgiving time , and , uh , it was , uh , one of those generation novels , you know -- Oh , yes . -- starts out when they 're small and continues through generations -- Oh , I always like those . -- and I like that . 

Have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch ? Yes , I have . Is n't she fabulous ? Oh , she is wonderful . Oh , once you st , I do n't like to get one of her books because , I , I just live to read . 

I 'll , I 'll skip everything just to get back to the book . I stayed up one night , I think until two -- Oh , yeah . -- in the morning finishing one of hers because I star , I could not put it down . She 's just a , I do n't know , does she , how often does she come out with them . I probably have missed the last few since I 've been back in school . 

Well , no , it seems like she does n't write as often as , oh , well , like Danielle Steele and those silly things . She writes the same thing . Well , she can , she can turn them out overnight , I swear . Yeah , and , and they 're the same silly things , I mean , if you 've read one , I mean it 's , Yeah , I 've never read a whole one of hers , I do n't think . It , it 's practically the same thing over and over , you know . And think how rich she is . Yeah , 

would n't I , you know , I 'm criticizing her , and would n't I like to have her money -- Oh , yeah . -- because they go from hardback to paperback and she has millions of them . 

And then make movies out of some of them . Uh-huh . You know , mini series and so forth , and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often . I have not seen as many of hers . Well , hers are so involved , and they 're so -- Uh-huh . 

-- such a higher intellectual level , because she quotes a lot , you know . I think she does a lot of research , too . I do too , so she could n't possibly turn them out like some of these popular -- Huh-uh . 

-- writers , but oh , her books are just incredible . I do n't think they 've ever made a movie , do you ? No , 

I do n't think so , and I 've often wondered why , have n't you ? Yes -- You know , I , -- well , no , uh , I really just thought about it now but there 's just , Yeah . 

Maybe it 's because they take so much in . I do n't know . Uh-huh . Maybe they 're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them , you know . They 're so big -- Uh-huh . -- they 're such , you know , it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND , I guess -- Yeah . -- another three hour movie . 

And maybe that turns people off , but look at GONE WITH THE WIND , you know . Oh , I know . It 's about one of my favorite movies . 

Uh , have you , uh , gotten into SCARLETT yet ? No , it had such a bad press , I was n't too MUMBLEx . Yeah , that 's exactly what I was going to say . I was amazed , 

because I , in the beginning when it was on , you know , on route coming out -- Uh-huh . -- I heard mixed publicity -- Right . -- kind of good and bad , and then when it came out , all I heard was just , oh , how bad it was , that I did n't even want to get it . Me , either . 

Do you know anyone that 's read it ? Huh-uh . No , I have n't heard of anybody that 's read it , either . No . I think it was on the best-seller list , though -- Well -- -- for a while . -- it would n't surprise me ,
