Uh , well , I guess social change takes in a , a big category , but , uh , I guess the , the one aspect of it that I took in , uh , consideration is more economical . Um . I , I know that the amount of , or how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has , has greatly changed . Yes , I agree . I know , they , they did a , it was on a talk show , they took , uh , the parents and then the , uh , the son , and they compared income at different points in time when the , when the father was , you know , was a little bit younger and more in his heyday -- Uh-huh . -- and they , and they compared to the son 's , that he was making now . And even though the son was probably more successful , you know , higher up in the , the management ladder -- Right . -- uh , his , he was actually making less money -- Um . -- when you co- , when you go by costs of living . Right , uh-huh . And it 's depending on where you live , though , too . Yeah . I know just , uh , just with me , ten years ago , I was comparing the , I think I , I was living better ten years ago than I am now , even though I 'm making more money now , 

but my dollar went a lot farther . Yeah . That 's true . Ten years ago I was eleven . Oh . I remember though , like buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now . Yeah . And gas , and I used to hear stories from my Grandpa , and , you know , he could see a movie for like a nickel and things like that . Yeah , well , I , I know gas prices have definitely jumped , uh , from , uh , I know I used to pay twenty-five cents a gallon and now it 's over a buck . Yeah . I do n't know what it 's , uh , by you . 

Around here Minnesota , Wisconsin area it 's , uh , it 's dropping , but I think it 's about a dollar fifteen on an average . Yeah , I 'm from Wisconsin , 

yeah , MUMBLEx . Okay . Well that 's , uh , that 's unu- , most of the people I talk to are Texas , so . 

Oh , yeah , I spoke to a person from Texas , too . Yeah . This is only my second phone call so I 'm -- Oh . -- waiting for mine . I suppose this will be one of my , towards my last one pretty soon , so they 'll stop me -- Um . -- but , uh , I 'm , uh , I 'm pretty much out to the things to say . Oh , like , like social changes . Yeah . 

Um , um , and I do n't think this would have anything to do with it , but like clothing and styles , lot of those changed . Okay , yeah , I , I ,  I do n't think they , they consider , like I say , it 's a broad category , it 's just I 'm not economical but -- Yeah . -- uh , even attitudes -- Uh-huh , definitely . -- on , on clothing and stuff , uh , I know . Towards each other . Yeah , 

I , I , I know a lot of the things that , that we wear , men wear nowadays were , would have been considered , uh , feminine , uh , many years ago , but . Uh-huh , yeah . I know , it 's been , it was hard for me at first , but now I kind of like , you know , a lot of the bright colors . Yeah . I mean , like I used to be more , uh , conservative and just your basic colors , but now I , I do like some of these , uh , brighter , fluorescent colors . Yeah , but they , styles come and go all the time , though . It 's just ridiculous , fads in and out . And even , um , clothing from the sixties came back . Yeah . I see a lot of , um , girls wearing sixties clothes . Yeah . I , I , I guess the , the best thing I like to see from the sixties and seventies is , of course , is the mini skirt , of course .  

One of the nice things , but , uh , yeah , I do n't think that there 's anything as original , it 's , it 's all based on , uh , one of the past styles , they just , um , make their , uh , circle and come back again . Yeah . So if you hang onto your clothes long enough , uh -- Yeah . -- they 'll , they 'll be back in style in a few years . That 's true , maybe some day I probably wo n't be alive to see it , but prices might go down lot more . Yeah . I do n't know though , does n't look good . Well , I think , thinking back , I think the only style I hope does n't come back is bell bottoms . Yeah , I remember that , I do . I guess when I look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms I say God . Yeah , I did n't really care for them either . But now I ,
