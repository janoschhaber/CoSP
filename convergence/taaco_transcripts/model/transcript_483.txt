Well , this is an unusual topic . What do you think about it ? Yeah , I , at first I , 

it took eight times to find you so I told my husband , uh , you know , what should I say and then he reminded me , but , uh , uh , hi- , in his family , uh , what they usually do , on his dad 's side , his mom or , uh , the aunts will send out little postcards , like , two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the , the , where to meet and , you know , just , to bring anything , and so they just notify everyone by mail , and then they just meet at , like , a park or something to have like a , a short , uh , or a small , uh , dinner type thing . Well , that sounds great , Ellen . How far away do they come from ? 

Uh , they come from , well , they all meet in Portland and they come as far as , oh , Seattle and , and sometimes we 've gone and we were f- , we were living in Utah at the time . Oh , okay . And , uh , the , his , his dad 's family is all around the area and his mom 's side of the family , they all , uh , have their family reunions in southern Utah and people would come from Seattle to there and , uh , let 's see , Nevada and in that area , Washington and Nevada to southern Utah and they would , uh , assign a different person , each time they had a reunion they 'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody . Oh , okay , that makes sense . Nobody 's out of a lot of trouble more than once . Yeah , yeah and the people who are down there , like , they 'll assign one person in the Utah area , one person in the Washington area and that person can call , you know , beforehand and just make sure everyone knows , too . Uh-huh . 

And then they just sort of do like a little program or , you know , something like that so -- Yeah . -- that everyone 's sort of involved . That 's interesting . 

You sound like you 've had a lot of experience with this , then . Oh , well , that 's my husband 's side and my mom , my mom 's , or my family , uh , we all live in southern California so we just have to either or , give a formal invite and we 're all there so , Southern California 's still pretty large . Yeah well , I mean L A , Orange County area . 

I mean -- I see . -- everyone 's , you know -- MUMBLEx . -- mostly not farther than an hour away . Yeah , well , my experience , uh , has been limited pretty much lately to my mother 's side of the family . Uh-huh . Uh , years ago there was a big dispute on my dad 's side and , uh , they have n't had a reunion since then . They just show up at funerals and weddings . Oh . It was pretty serious and lot of yelling -- Wow . 

-- and all that , but , anyway , my mother 's side we had our , our first real reunion that I 've ever gone to last summer and they had people come in from out of town and they took some rooms down at a Holiday Inn and , uh , they had some activity , they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree and , you know , a lot of that sort of thing . Since it was the first one that we 'd had that , you could do that once . Now next time we have one , we 'll have to think of something more creative to do . 

Well , you know , that 's interesting because one thing that always brings to my , uh , husband 's mother 's side together is , uh , they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time and , uh , inevitably everyone is just very interested and , and they always have , you know , two or three new ones to add to the list , you know , someone 's been born or -- Oh . -- someone passed away or , you know , something like that and so everyone has to update their little -- Well , have -- 

-- books or whatever . -- have you , do you have an interest in genealogy ? Uh , I do , but not to , very much compared to my -- Not a -- -- mother-in-law . -- passion , huh . Uh , I suspect we 'll do quite a bit more genealogy and I , I suspect we will do more of it . Uh , I found out some , about some of the relatives I did n't , you know , I , I did n't even know their names , some of the -- Um . -- two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles and , uh , there 's a lot of things there you have to stop , they 're really kind of fascinating . I found out my grandmother was one of a twin . Oh . And we do n't even know where the twin , we have virtually no , no background on , on her -- Really ? -- on the twin . 

Is it your , your grandma 's own sibling and she , My grandmother 's , uh , sister who would be somewhere in , in West Virginia . I 'm sure she 's , you know , dead now , because my grandmother died in , about twenty years ago . Oh , I see . Oh so , I 'm , I 'm quite a bit , I 'm probably a lot older than you are . Uh , Well , maybe , uh , they just moved away and then sort of lost contact . I do n't know .
