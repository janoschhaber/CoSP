Uh , national health insurance , I think , is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive . Right . Yeah , because , uh , the articles that I 've read regarding national health service in Canada and England has indicated that , uh , what i- , stay , stay in line for , uh , four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor . Right . Yeah , I 'm , I 'm sort of mixed on this . 

I think that the , the answer may lie in , uh , not in so much a , uh , national kind of medical thing that li- , like England has but more of a , um , national insurance , uh , sort of clearinghouse or whatever . I think that , uh , too many , uh , the problem with , with right now is w- , that we 've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through and , and I think that , I think you , you mentioned Canada . I think that they have a system where , uh , they , the government deals with the , with , I mean , you , you go to whoever you want but file through one , one s- , particular , Um , I see . uh , setup and that way they , they are able to reduce prices because they 've , you know , it 's , it 's all one , one centralized thing . Yeah . 

Well , I , I think that , uh , again having gone through a period when I was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own , if you do n't have a company supporting you in the , uh , picking up the major portion of your health insurance , Uh-huh . the cost is p , almost prohibitive . Right . Uh , I , I was listening , uh , on the radio the other day and they were talking that , s- , s- , something like this , 

I think they were talking about the fact that , um , the money that could be saved , um , in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider , um , could , uh , could , they could make it , i- , i- , provide health insurance to , to people who could n't afford it just by the money they would save . Yeah . Uh , we 're currently , where I 'm working now , under Blue Cross . 

I do n't know what the total cost of the program is but for dependent coverage I 'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a , a month or something like that . Right . So I assume that probably the total cove- , cost is probably , three fifty to four hundred . They 're probably picking up about half of it . Right . And that 's a pretty good policy , but if you had something like one of these , uh , health maintenance programs , Yeah , H M O . H M O , uh , where the , uh , where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest . If you tried to buy something like that , I 'm prob- , it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something . Yeah , and they 're , they 're fairly expensive . I , I , um , I ha , I was on an H M O , uh , up until last year -- Yeah . -- and , uh , through work . And it was , 

I forget how much I paid a month but it was much , you know , is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care . Yeah . And , uh , the reason I , I quite was because of , uh , not because I did n't like it , I , I really kind of did . Uh , the reason I quite was just because the , the doctor a , a certain doctor that we en , enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that H M O so we , my wife decided she wanted to , to stay with that doctor , Yeah . so , we went to the , to the , the medical insurance that we have at , here at work , Yeah . and , uh , I , uh , I like the , I like the convenience of the H M O in , in a certain respect because it , uh , even though you 're , once you find the doctor that you like it 's not a problem . You know , a lot of people complain saying well , I do n't want to , uh , have to be told who I need to go to but , you know , if you do n't have a doctor anyway normally it does n't really make much difference . Yeah , that 's right . 

Because you can , you know , if , if you find someone you really like and then , we did find several good doctors . And , um , like you say it 's , uh , five dollars an office visit . And , um , my wife was in the hospital had our , had our daughter and I think her total bill was around three hundred dollars -- 

Oh , goodness . -- for everything . Delivery room and everything . Yeah . Include , including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay but that was , that was still included in that pr- , that cost so . Yeah . It 's really nice because they , th- , you know , their , their attitude is different than , than a regular , uh , insurance , uh , health insurance , uh , the , in , in a , H M O , you know , they 're trying to prevent a problem by , by keeping the cost down at the front end , Yeah . you know , and have you come in , you know , they , they charge five dollars a s- , Yeah . you know , pop , you 're more willing to go in and try , MUMBLEx . to take care of a problem before it grows big . As to a company 's benefit , to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job . Yeah . 

Because they do n't have to worry about going in and , and paying , uh , seventy-five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes . Right . That 's a , Yeah , 

I , I , uh , I , I really liked it . We both , my wife and I both did . You , you do n't have to worry about filling out forms , uh , you know , for reimbursement and all or , you know , getting paid eight percent of , of whatever . You just pay the , the five dollars right then and then you 're done with it . Yeah . But here again the , the doctor 's practices in hospitals , have gon , become fairly sizable businesses under themselves now . Uh-huh . Uh , you take a hospital , uh , the physical plant itself , you have to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building , uh , when the e , rooms are empty . Right . So , they spread the costs out over , uh , all the patient costs and , uh , that 's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that . Right . The horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and , uh , it being , a four thousand dollar bill . Well , they , and you know , they 're also p- , take , they 're taking up the cost of people who ca n't pay . Right . You know , they , they get a lot of , uh , a lot of , uh , people who are j- , just have to be there and ca n't afford it and so they , they know they 're not going to get pa- , Yeah . you know , get money from them so they , Yeah . have to absorb it somewhere else . Yeah . 

My daughter and son-in-law had a baby , here about , uh , what , he- , he 'll be three in August . Uh-huh . And , uh , their insurance plan that they 're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital . Right . And like she went in , she had the baby and she was out in two days time . Right . And it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital , Right . the , the deductibles did n't apply . Right . And so that 's one way , one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by , uh , okay , if you 'll shorten your stay then we will , uh , waive the deductible . Right . Our , our insurance is , uh , is doing something similar where they 're also going to mor ,
