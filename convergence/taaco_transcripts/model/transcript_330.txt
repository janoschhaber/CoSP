Well , I almost forgot the topic , I was waiting so long for , uh , for it to find somebody . Um , It 's on your favorite T V shows and why . Right , well , so what is your favorite T V show ? Uh , MAJOR DAD . 

Oh , you like that one ? I , I love it , I think it promotes good family values , and it 's funny . Uh-huh . Uh , I 've never really watched that one . 

You know , it 's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows -- That 's ri , yeah . -- and , uh , you know , there 's , so there 's only a few that I , that I like to watch routinely . What kind do you like to watch ? Probably my favorite is , um , oh , well , I like shows like GROWING PAINS and , uh , what 's the other one now , they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night , so I do n't get to watch it very much . WONDER YEARS ? WONDER YEARS , yeah , that 's my favorite . Uh , I like both of those real much also . I , I think basically , they pr , same thing , they promote family values . Yeah . WONDER YEARS , 

I , I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever . I guess I can really relate to it , and , uh , it 's just a real cute show . Uh , I , I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of , uh , I do n't know , honesty or sort of a purity value , I guess . I do , too . I , I do n't like it , uh , lot of the shows that , that I 've liked in the past , like , uh , oh , GOLDEN GIRLS and , some of them tend to get so risque , and when you -- Uh-huh . -- have children -- Yeah , -- uh , watching it , that sometimes really starts to bother me -- Right , right . -- and , uh , that 's one of the reasons , I mean , if you want to go all time favorite show , probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE -- Uh-huh , yeah , 

my wife really likes that show , -- yeah , which I just , I was , I always felt was wonderful -- Uh-huh . -- uh , and so many of them nowadays , like I said , I think are just , um -- Yeah . -- uh , they , they go after , well , they , like I said , the risque stuff , just I guess they think that 's what people want to watch . Yeah , well , there was , but there 's a sense of ho- , I guess , purity in the show , like one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS -- Yes . -- but , uh , you know , Richie always used to be so , you know , just so honest and pure -- Yeah . 

-- I guess , and when he left the show , you know , that , it seemed to be missing that part of it -- Uh-huh . -- and I never did like it after that -- Uh-huh . -- so , I do n't know , I , I say , see the same thing in like WONDER YEARS and a lot of the shows that I like to watch . There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere . Yeah , I , I agree . Uh , do you like the sports programming ? Yeah , uh-huh . Um , I , I enjoy those also , almost as , as much to a certain extent . I 'm , our whole house is baseball fans -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , we enjoy that , and , uh -- So you 're going to watch a game tonight ? -- oh yeah , oh , yeah . So do you , do you have a favorite for the series or anything ? Uh , probably the Pirates , but only because of Steve Bushel , I guess -- Oh , uh-huh . -- otherwise I really do n't care that much , 

but , uh , you know , I 'm , I 'm annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him , and , uh , I 'd like to see him do well , like all the way to the bank -- Yes . -- I guess . Yeah , he 's a nice guy . I take it you live in the Dallas area . Do you live in the Dallas area ? Live in , live in Plano . Uh-huh , yeah , I live in Garland , and , yeah , I , I like Steve Bushel , but I do n't really like the Pirates . I 'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan -- Uh-huh . -- so , uh , I 'm kind of , I 'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all , 

they , you know , they -- Uh-huh . -- they 've come from so far down , I really would like to see them do well . Well , yeah , yeah , it 's , uh , 

so I keep hoping the Rangers are going to do . Yeah , one , one year they , maybe they 'll make it , I do n't know -- Right . -- so , but , uh , yeah , I like sports programming quite a bit , but , uh , I guess my , my favorite shows are the , and , you know , that getting back to the point that you made , that 's really true , we were watching ROSEANNE , I guess , couple of weeks ago , and her daughter was talking about birth control , you know -- Uh-huh . -- and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time , and , you know , she 's only seven years old , so , Well , it 's , 

so many of them now , um , you know , it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in , and -- Yeah . -- and , uh , you know , I 'm , you know , I 'm , I 'm an adult -- Yeah . -- and I have adult tastes now , but I do n't need that -- Yeah , yeah . -- uh , I , I like things that , uh , are , are wholesome , I guess . Yeah , well that , that seems to be more our values , too , 

like the WONDER YEARS , I , I mean , it 's kind of risque stuff for , maybe for teenagers , you know , or , and you can kind of relate to it -- Uh-huh . -- you know , I do n't know , that 's , I enjoy that a lot -- Yes , yes . -- but , uh , you know , I agree with you , the , and it 's funny because the shows , like a lot of them that used to be considered risque , like THREE 'S COMPANY and stuff , I think they , they maintained , people would watch them because there was that , uh , you know , there was really the period that was going on there , I mean , he really was n't messing around with the girls , but everybody perceived him that way , and stuff -- Uh-huh . -- but as soon as , you know , he went to move in with another girl , the show just died -- Yeah . -- and it 's , it 's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way ,
