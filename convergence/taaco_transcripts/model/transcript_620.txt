Uh , a lot of companies now are , are using , uh , drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to , to root out the , the either , uh , elementary or intermediate or advanced , uh , drug users . Uh-huh . And , uh , I know the , the government is , uh , you know , gives drug tests an- , to all new entrants , all new appli- , applicants coming into government . Uh-huh . And , and I quite frankly , do n't see anything wrong with it . I , I 'm , I guess I 'm not a good civil libertarian . And , and I , I feel as though , uh , that , uh , uh , you know , that if you , you 're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that 's difficult unless you really go into a deep background . Of course , we 're , we 're , being involved in my organization , uh , we , we have deep background checks and -- Sure , sure . -- and so , uh , but , but , sometimes , you know , drug use can , can escape that . And , uh , I have absolutely -- Huh . -- no compunction about , uh , using any and all means to , to , uh , uh , you know , work out , figure out who has a drug program or who has a drug problem -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , and putting that guy into , into therapy to , whatever it is to , to , you know , break this , uh , activity . Of course , if he 's fallen in love with drugs and there is n't anything but getting stoned or high is , is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful , then maybe there is no hope . Yeah . What 's your , uh , feeling ? Uh , well I guess I , I guess I 'm probably a little more to , toward the other direction . Uh , well I guess , mainly because , uh , it 's , I , well , like there 's two sides to it I guess . 

Uh , one is that , uh , if you 're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug , alcohol , whatever , or , you know , even if it 's smoking , inhibits , you know , your ability to function , then I , I think that , that , you know , I do n't have any problem at all with testing that individual , you know , on the spot . Uh , but I guess I feel more like whatever you 're doing in your own private life is your own private business . Uh , and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that , uh , things like drug laws seem to come and go . You know , we had prohibition for awhile and then we did n't have prohibition . Uh , you know , we 've had , I guess , laws against , uh , you know , various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years , I guess . Uh-huh . Maybe a little longer . Well I think , uh , the dr- , the laws on , uh , uh , uh , the first morphine laws were , were like ninety , or nineteen ten or nineteen five , something like that . Yeah . So , ei- , eighty years or so . Yeah . Yeah . Uh , so I , 

you know , it 's , it 's hard to , I guess , for me to justify what so- , seems like , you know , basically a breach of the First Amen- , you know , freedom from , uh , search and seizure , you know , uh , on something that may or may not stand as a law , you know , fifty years from now or even twenty or ten , who knows . Well , the thing of it is the , the , tha- , tha- , -- I mean , prohibition certainly did n't last . -- that , that is , uh , uh , in , in many respects , uh , uh , you know , just , just , I think , an over simplification . I , I think there , th- , th- , th- , there 's so much criminal activity , uh , that people go into to , to support drug habits . Well , but you got to look at prohibition though . You had the same problems there , right ? Yeah . You know , they , they support drug habits with , uh , with , uh , you know , with things like , uh , you know , burglary or , or prostitution or stuff like that , yeah . Oh , yeah . Sure . Well it goes back to that , again , if you look at prohibition . I mean because it 's illegal , it costs more . If it was legal , I mean , face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what , ten or twenty dollars an ounce . I , I I must admit that , 

And clearly if you 're into coke and all you want to do is , you know , snort your brains out all day long , if it was legal , you could do it real cheap and , you know , you 'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it . Yeah . But , yeah , get , uh , Yeah . I , I must admit that the production costs of , of these drugs are , are zippo compared to the street market costs and , and the costs to society , yeah . Oh , yeah , well that 's why there 's , you know , people dealing it because there 's money in it , you know . There 's ridiculous amounts of money . But I , I , I , I think that , that the , that , you know , the , being in law enforcement , you know , th- , th- , th- , they , I , I probably have a kind of a draconian , Philistine attitude toward it . 

And , but , but the , uh , uh , I , I really feel as though the interdiction effort is , is , as soon as you , you get rid of one goon that 's , that 's , that 's involved in drugs and tha- , Oh yeah , interdiction 's hopeless . I mean -- Yeah , and then another , another one will jump up . 

-- there 's no way you 're ever going to win that . But we , we see , The tighter you squeeze , the more the price goes up , the more incentive there is . I mean that 's a losing fight . Yeah . 

A- , a- , as soon as we wind up , uh , uh , you know , for , well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand but , but people -- Yeah , yeah . -- want to , get , get stoned and I , I do n't see that , Well , yeah . 

It goes back to , you know , what right , what can society impose on people . I mean , can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen ? Yeah . I do n't think you can . I mean , you know , I 'm , you know , was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic so , you know , I 'm one of these , you know , ten , twelve , fifteen , twenty hour a day type people . Uh-huh . So , you know , yeah , I can really relate to yeah , everybody ought to do their own share , you know . I do n't have any , you know , love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they 're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff . Uh-huh . But , you know ,
