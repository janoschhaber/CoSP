Okay . All right . Well , I am , uh , the product of , uh , I think as much the changing roles of women as anyone , my mother , uh , we come from a , my mother and I were , uh , really , prac- , first generation divorce in our family . Yes . My , uh , mother was divorced in nineteen , uh , fifty-seven , Uh-huh . when I was seven years old . Uh-huh . And , was , I was the first one , of anyone that , that anyone had ever known , to have a divorce . Uh-huh . Of course , now fifty percent divorces in the United States , uh , my mother , uh , was treated very badly , uh , in a , by a lot of people , family members , um , especially from my father 's side of the family , and also , uh , uh , uh , we were , uh , Uh-huh . ostracized by his family , uh , basically just , you know , uh , we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth . Right . And , they all felt that th- , there was never an issue that my father was the , was the cause of the reason for the split up , even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce . Oh , mercy . 

Uh , it was always my mother 's fault , she was not , uh , sufficient , you know , she just was not good enough . What was wrong with her , was she not attractive enough , did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest . It was that kind of an attitude . Yeah , 

that , that 's too bad . So , uh , yeah it was too bad , it was really rough . Um , um , that 's sad . It really is . Uh , so , you know , that 's so changing , some of the changing roles of women in that respect , I have been a product of . Uh-huh . Um , I think that there are people that , I think that , uh , I was a- , I was first generation going to college in my family . Uh-huh . Uh , first , my mother had always had a quote career , but always a career as a , uh , uh , in a secretarial position . She did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial pro- , profession in Des Moines , Iowa . That 's , that 's wonderful . She was a secretary to , uh , uh , the jud- , to , uh , a circuit court judge , federal judge . Uh-huh . And it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him . So , that was a really high , high status position . Well , that 's wonderful . She made over thirty thousand , That speaks , a year . well of your mother . 

Well , yeah , she a real hard la- , She had high standards . Yeah . Yeah . hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back , you know . Oh , bless her heart . But , uh , so I went to college and now since have completed two master 's degrees and I am the director of music in a church . 

Um , and but it 's interestingly enough , I am still , everyday , confronted with , Challenges . Absolutely . Uh-huh . Challenges that have to do with my sex . Right . Uh , for instance , uh , well , you know , I am just not taken as seriously , you know , Uh-huh . at professions , as many of the wom- , as many of the men who are doing the same job I do . And , uh , the choir members treat me differently because I am a woman , they expect me to be more motherly , they question my authority more , uh , than they ever would a man . And I have experience with this , because I work at both , both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man . Uh- , uh-huh . So I am pretty , I am pretty ob- , pretty cons- , I mean , I am pretty aware of what goes on -- Surely . -- uh , in the church . So , basically that 's , that 's , well I am done talking . Do you want to talk ? . Well , I think that you carried forth your subject matter very well , uh , Nickie . And I can , uh , relate to that , uh , Uh-huh . uh , I think it 's , it 's the image that the woman has and , uh , in the world , Uh-huh . 

as , uh , the lesser of the two . Oh , always . And , uh , I think things are changing , but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to , Uh-huh . like it to take . And , Indeed . uh , I think we are progressing at a snail 's pace , but we are progressing . Uh-huh . So , that 's the main point is that we are going ahead . Uh-huh . And , uh , I think that , uh , in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve . Uh-huh . And , uh , men , uh , have , a lot of them have , uh , come around and have seen , Uh-huh . the error of their ways . Uh-huh . But there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change . Uh-huh . So we have to , uh , face that reality also . I have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change , why they can not bend . I mean , why they can not just accept , you know , competent women , I , I have never been able to understand that . I guess it 's fear . I mean what , 

It could be , if they are af- , they are not sure of themselves . Sure . The ones that , uh , go along with that , they are sure of themselves . Uh-huh . And they know that they can , uh , you know , uh , be on the same level . Uh-huh . And they do not have any , uh , ego , uh , problems that they are fighting . Uh-huh , uh-huh . And , uh , I think that we are going to be , uh , on par with them -- Uh-huh . -- in salary and in recognition , Uh-huh . in the long term . Uh-huh . Uh , and I , what I would like to see happen futuristically , Uh-huh . is what we are discussing , Uh-huh . is that yes , uh , we each have our , uh , jobs in life , Uh-huh . and that we should recognize that . And that we should support each other . Uh-huh . And , uh , I think our problems would be fewer , Uh-huh . if we supported each other . Uh-huh . And just looked at each other as equals and none lesser , because we are equal . Men have a lot of trouble with that though . Uh-huh . They , in their , in their own peer relationships , they do not treat themselves equal , and so it 's really difficult for them to treat women as equals . They are , they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower . Uh , it just seems that , it seems , it seems that they are more comfortable that way . 

And I do not know if that 's , I mean , that 's , it 's a militaristic point of view I guess , you know , somebody can not be colonel and everybody else is infantry , but it 's just really interesting to me . I am married to a wonderful man , you know , who treats me very , you know , with a , with as , I think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time . But , when he gets angry , it 's always over control issues , it 's always over power issues , it 's never over , you know , it 's always , you said you were going to do something and you did not do it . As if he is the boss and I am the , you know , and I am the slave . uh-huh . And it , those are the only , only issues we ever fight about . I think it 's just , I think it 's just difficult for men to , uh , to accept women equally , even if they want to , they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss . Uh , dictator , dictatorships are real efficient . Well , I guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us . Um . And , uh , the women when they are married , they are to be subjective to their husbands . Um . And I believe that strongly . Um . And , uh , but I think that they should be in harmony with what they are , with what the subject matter is . Um . And I think the issue should be settled before there 's a conflict . Huh . Uh , and I think that can happen in a very won , wonderful way . Huh . And if we , men and women , would do as the Bible said , that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves . Uh-huh . Can you picture that ? Uh-huh . I mean , if your husband did that to you , Uh-huh . and you did that to your husband , Uh-huh . you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself . Yeah , it 's true . And , uh , that 's really the , the divine answer , Uh-huh . and , and the right answer . Uh-huh . So , uh , uh , that would be a beautiful relationship . Uh-huh , it would be . And I think there are some people that have done that , Uh-huh . and I have seen it . Uh-huh . And it 's , it 's just marvelous , and I am just in awe to see this ,
