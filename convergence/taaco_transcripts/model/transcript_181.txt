Okay , um , yeah , one year public service for everybody . Is that , that was it , right ? . Right . Uh , who wants to start this one ? Em- , I do n't know , I 've been , I 've been sitting here thinking , yeah , because it was , you know , took a couple tries before I found somebody . 

Well , you know , I 'm like , I 'm not really sure what I think about this . Um , uh , I mean , the first thing is , the uh , if it 's going to be mandatory , it 's got to be mandatory , I mean , everybody , not just like , you know , poor people and all that , you know . But , Right , right . you know , senators ' sons and all that stuff too . I mean , everybody 's got to do it . Um , I do n't know , it 'd probably be , it 'd probably be good , I just do n't know if , you know , I was eighteen or whatever , I 'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever . I 'm not sure I want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision . Uh , I mean , that , that does n't sound right . Um , I guess I see overall beneficial , if , if we 're going from that point of view . Uh-huh . Um . I- , you know , in the past , I do n't know , I do n't know how old you are , but when I was , uh , in high school , it was the beginning of Vietnam and so forth . And many of my peers were being drafted . Uh-huh . And I could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever . But I , I felt strongly then that even if they did n't feel like they could kill someone , or go into a military situation , that they could help the country in other ways . Be it cleaning out , uh , lots , in , in their neighborhood or , Uh-huh . whatever kind of community or public service might be available . And I guess I see that as , as not so much a demand but , but a privilege . It 's , it 's kind of , uh , uh , 

It is , uh , It 's something , it 's , it 's since we live here and we all benefit , rich , poor or in between , uh , there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest . I just see that as maybe a good idea . I would n't mind doing it at forty-four . Uh-huh . Uh , and I find ways to , to turn some of that back to , to others . Uh , and I , I guess I , I ca n't see that as being something to really object to . 

Well , I guess it would still depend on how , I mean , if , if you 're talking about any- , if you 're talking about something that 's like a full time , you know , one year full time , you know , this is what you do , you know . You 're going to go and , and fill pot holes and , you know , and , you know , all that stuff . I mean , I , you know , I do n't know . I could see a , a full , a run- , a gamut of different kinds of opportunities . Things that need to be done , Uh-huh . that wou , that could be done in an hour or two , Uh-huh . uh , a day , or several hours of the week . Like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that . In addition to what one does , Uh-huh . uh , besides that . I , I ca n't , imagine what kind of , uh , uh , bureaucracies we 'd get into and expense having it be full time , oh , you 're going to go to this camp and you 're going to , you know , like , um , back in the Depression , the C C C , Yeah . it was needed , it gave some folks some jobs , and we got some great public works out of it . But , um , I do n't see that as being necessary now . I can see it being done , uh , on a regular schedule . Uh-huh . Uh , everybody has to put in so many hours of , uh , public service in a given time , perhaps . Uh-huh . Uh , I , I guess I see all of us benefiting , and I , I do n't see it just relegated to the young . But I see , I , I see so much going on that , that 's bad . And this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem . Uh-huh . Something that they turn , Well , back . and also , you know , you , you feel more like , you know , you 're actually part of the community if you 've done something , That 's right . 

in it . You take pride in that , and , and get some , some positive feedback from those who benefit , Uh-huh . besides yourself . And I , I see it being most beneficial if it 's in the neighborhood where or , or at least the area where the person lives . Uh , definitely . It might not be the same neighborhood , but the same city or county , because then you 're , you 're coming in contact with it . It 's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that I 'll never be able to see again , unless I happen to go on vacation , Right . up there . Yeah . It 's , it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual , on going . Yeah . But as far as putting that into work , I do n't want to , I do n't want to deal with the , with the heartache of , first of all , getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics , Oh , that would , of it . be a nightmare . And just , I mean , just getting , getting it going . Yeah . Yeah . I , I , see a lot of things like , uh , scouting , uh , Uh-huh . Boys Clubs , Girls Clubs , things like that , that kind of get into that citizenship , uh , the uh , looking after the environment sort of thing -- Uh-huh . -- And I guess , I do n't see , uh , this being that different . But even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in , Uh-huh . and would take a turn in . Uh-huh . Yeah . Do you have kids ? 

N- , no , not yet . In about six months we will . Oh , well good . 

Th- , you 'll have a little time think about that . I guess , I , I have , uh , when I was teaching school I saw many , so many kids that were at loose ends and that did n't really have a purpose . And I can see , you know , some , some really significant things coming out of it . Uh-huh . I know you 've got to get past that , that grudge attitude that many have , but that 's , uh , tha- , that would be a part of selling it to the community . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . uh , parish or however the state was divided up . Um , I may , well I do n't know , around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for . Boy Scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will , uh , police a , uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee- , and I , I 've seen it in other states too . Yeah . 

They have , I do n't know , that here . Um , um , 

they 've got , um , in most of the states around here I think , uh . You know , down in North Carolina , there was a big controversy for a while , because they , uh , the local chapter of the K K K wanted to , uh , uh , to participate in it and , uh , and there were those that said , No , you ca n't do that , I 'm sure . Well , uh , it was , it was interesting because that 's an interesting question , you know . Yeah . Should these people be allowed to or not ? I think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed . Oh . And I had n't even thought about that , uh , the , the other end of that . That , that 's an interesting , uh , situation . I had n't thought of that . We had visited relatives in Virginia , not too long ago , 

and I thought I had seen , when we were traveling around the state , some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up and , Yeah . I think Virginia 's got it and I know Maryland does , and we just , we went to Indianapolis last weekend , and back . And , um , I 'm pretty sure I saw , yeah , stuff in Ohio and Indi- , Indiana about it and Pennsylvania , maybe Pennsylvania , I do n't remember for sure now . 

And I do n't know about your part of the country , but , uh , down here in the last , oh , year plus , I , it was las , beginning with last year 's Earth Day -- Uh-huh . -- There 's just been more of a turn toward uh , environmental concerns , and e- , I work for Texas Instruments . Uh-huh . And they , they 've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said , Well , it 's not feasible , Uh-huh . it 's not a good idea . And , Yeah . And but then they lost , 

I see that as being , too much business . I , I see that as being a , a , a change , uh , for the positive . Kind of along the same line as , as , as the mandatory thing . It 's just , thing , a part of everyone 's consciousness . Uh-huh . Well , the thing about that is though , it 's got a , 

I mean because it was , I mean it was big , you remember , like in the early seventies and all that . And , you know , and then it kind of just went out of vogue . And I , I 'm worried that it , it might , you know , it 'll , it , the same thing will happen . It 's like , you know , environmentalism was really big for a couple of years and then people like , well , you know , I 'd ruther , rather spend , you know , fifty cents less on , uh , on , on such and such , you know , and even if it 's not environmentally safe , who cares , you know . I 'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way . Uh , there have been too many other things that it 's done that for , just in my life . And if you look at history at all , you see that , you know , uh , we go from one side to the other on just about any subject , Yeah . that you , one might care to bring up . But , it is comforting to me to see , uh , more concern about some of these things that , that cost us money . Especially when we have dwindling , uh , resources such as oil that 's burning out of control in the Persian Gulf , and , and so forth . Just , just every little bit does , it makes me feel better . It , it makes me feel like , well , there may be something left for my children , my nieces and nephews and so forth . Well , yeah , uh . Well , uh , would n't , it 's just probably a good thing that the oil 's burning and may , may , make some people realize that hey , you know , this stuff runs out . That 's , that 's right , because , Of course , that 's probably blasphemy for you to say , uh , coming from where you are in Texas . Uh , no , no , because if , we , what was it , seventy-four when we had the , the last last oil crisis ? And , uh , we started getting smart and , and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth . Uh-huh . 

And as soon as the oil prices came back down , we , the pendulum swang the other way . Right . And we need those reminders . Yeah . Uh , or we 'll suddenly be in the dark and say , Oh , my goodness , now we do n't have the ability to go on to some new technology . Right . Well , my dad 's in the , in the solar energy business , 

so , uh , Ah ! You know , we 're acutely aware of a lot of this . But , you know , on the other hand , he voted for George Bush , so um , you know , I , I wonder sometimes if he knows what he 's doing . Well , I thi , you know , 

just about anybody you could name , whether I voted for them or not , Uh-huh . uh , makes , um , uh , decisions that I just ca n't go along with . But that 's why they 're there and not me . I do n't want the , Yeah . I do n't want the stress . Well , the , the thing with Bush ...
