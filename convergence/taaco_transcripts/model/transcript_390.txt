Uh , I guess , uh , I 've always been kind of interested in , in , space and stuff . I 've , Uh-huh . read a lot of the , Uh-huh . the , uh , astronomy books and , Uh-huh . and stuff like that . Uh , Uh-huh . Have you been following the , uh , the progress of the MUMBLEx space health code ? Uh , to a degree . I have n't kept up as , uh , much as I would like , Uh-huh . I 've just been so busy , uh , Uh-huh . I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then , so . Yeah . I think it 's pretty exciting that they can , uh , 

it would be interesting to see if they can find , uh , other planets that are , that will be more habitable to , uh , you know , uh , humans and , uh , yeah , I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if , uh , if it , you know , if it is at all possible . Yeah . 

Well , I would n't even mind , uh , being a pilot on one , or right now but I 'm probably getting a little too old for that . Well , I know if they make the advances that they have been making , that , uh , maybe age will no longer , age or even physical , uh , abilities may not be , uh , a barrier anymore . Right . Yeah . Well , they , they just made leaps and jumps . I think a lot of our , our technology we have is , is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel , uh , uh , equipment and stuff that , Yeah , I agree . Uh , as a matter of fact we 're the ones that I have been to Houston to , to , you know , to visit the , uh , space center out there , and , uh , one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , that vacuum , uh , little space program was one of the big , you know , backers of that . Yeah . It 's amazing , you know , you , it 's hard to imagine what life was like without it now . Yeah . I do n't know if you ever watch Gallagher , you know , he 's one of the comedians and -- Uh-huh , yeah , I 've h- , seen him before . 

-- and , you know , he , he talks a lot on , on Velcro . Wh , i- , what would we do without it ? . Yeah . Yo- , we were talking about that just the other day . What did we do without it back then ? Yeah . 

I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps . Yeah . Yeah , there 's , there 's a lot of , a lot of little things that have come up . I know maybe some of the big things that , uh , uh , concentrated foods for one maybe I don , 

That 's right . That 's right . Uh , I do n't know it 's also just I 've , I 've often pictured , uh , in my mind , you know , what it would be like to just , what would you find if you just kept on going , kept on going ? Uh-huh . That 's true . Uh , I guess our minds are so , uh , uh , what is it ? Uh , finite -- Uh-huh . -- when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object , Uh-huh . and it 's hard to , to see , you know . Yeah . I always thought well , what do you do hit a brick wall , eventually . 

It 's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely . Yeah , that , that is , uh , that is something that would be hard to think about . I agree . You know like you say we 're used to finite things and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible . Yeah . But , But , uh , yeah , I would like to see them , uh , do more in that area to make space travel more , uh , something that the ordinary person can , uh , en , enjoy . Yeah . I know it 's I think it 's in people 's nature to be the first to do something . Uh-huh . And I , I 'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like , you know , Yeah . Yeah , 

me too . I would n't even mind being not so much being first but just , uh , get out there and , and just explore . Yeah . I think , uh , it 's in everyone 's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they have n't , Huh . or experience something , you know , indifferent . 

I think that 's what made us , uh , progress to the state we are is our curiosity . Oh , sure . Sure . Of course . That 's true . There must be some better so- , better way of doing this . A better place to be or whatever , you know it 's , Uh-huh . So you , you are always looking for something better . Yeah , that 's true . I know at work , uh , people always complain to me 

I , well , you are always whining and , it 's , I 'm always looking for something better . Uh , Yeah . There 's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it . 

That 's right . That 's right . And if you are just content with being , you know , with the way things are then , you know , then you must lead , lead a pretty dull life . Yeah . Because if yo- , Well , they are always finding easier ways and , you know , just because they do n't talk about it or something like that . Uh-huh . And they are doing it un- , you know , unconsciously . Yeah , I guess , uh , you do n't really think about it too much . I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff 

but yo- , it , it 's in a subconscious , you know , thing . You know , somewhere they can sit down and write down what , you know , things that you 've improved upon , you probably would n't have a pretty good list . Uh-huh . But you just do n't think about them . Right . And that 's true . I think , uh , you know , we 've gotten different programs at work , you know , to , to , uh , make it visible to management that we are doing things better ,
