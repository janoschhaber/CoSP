Okay , so you said that you live in Coppell . Uh-huh . So what is your house like ? It 's a two bedroom , two baths duplex . Oh , well that 's neat , Brick -- Uh-huh -- -- and , uh , 

-- is it one you 're renting or buying ? No , we own it , yeah , well , our side . Yeah , yeah , well that 's kind of neat that you can -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- even though it 's a duplex , you can still buy . That 's good . Uh-huh , yeah . Do you have any children ? No , huh-uh . Do you ? Yes , I have two children , and our home is really too small for us right now . Ours is , too . We outgrew it when we moved in . Yeah , we moved from an apartment -- Uh-huh . -- that was really small , and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old -- Uh-huh . -- so we moved into this house in Garland , it 's in one of the older areas of town -- Uh-huh . -- and one thing I really like is it has big trees everywhere -- Uh-huh . -- you know , lots of shade and squirrels and birds and -- Um . -- real pretty , but the , the house is real small -- Yeah . -- it has less than a thousand square feet -- Oh , wow . -- yeah , it 's real little . You all are cramped . Yeah , and now I have a daughter , now my , the one that was five months old is seven years old -- Uh-huh . -- and the one , I have another one that 's three and a half -- Uh-huh . -- and have all these clothes , and -- Oh . -- toys and stuff that we 're just trying to find places to put , Uh-huh , how many bedrooms is it ? Well , they advertised it as a three bedroom house -- Uh-huh -- because it has a built on addition room , you know -- Uh-huh . -- but the room that 's built on does n't have a closet -- Oh . -- so , um , the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom -- Uh-huh . -- but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and -- Uh-huh . -- you know , it 's kind of a catch all room . But it sure is nice to have it -- Yeah . -- when the kids come over to play they all go out there to play with the Barbies -- Uh-huh . -- and that kind of stuff , so . How fun . Yeah , that works out good . And I 'm thankful I have two girls , because they 're in bunk beds , and -- Uh-huh . -- so , you know , they can share a room -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , make for more space that way . And how old 's the youngest ? She 's three and a half -- Uh-huh . -- yeah , so , um , and right now we have their clothes on , uh , like double racks , you know , in the closet -- Uh-huh . -- we made a higher and a lower -- Uh-huh . -- and it works out fine , but they 're just about to get too tall , where the dresses are beginning to drag -- Uh-huh . -- you know , and , um , we 're going to have to figure out a new idea . But we 're , we 're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home -- Yeah . -- uh , hoping to be able to do that within a year or so -- Yeah . -- so that would be nice . 

That 's what we 'd like to do . Yeah , is Coppell a nice area to live ? Oh , it 's a wonderful place to live , and they , I do n't have any kids , so I do n't really know , but they say that we have wonderful schools . Well , I think I 've heard a lot , uh , about Coppell schools , that they 're real good -- Uh-huh . 

-- that 's neat . Um . Do you , do you hope to have children , or are you not planning on having any , or , I do n't think so , no . 

I see . Well , do you have any pets ? Oh , of course , those are my kids -- 

Oh , yeah . -- I have two dogs . Uh-huh . Well , do they stay inside , or , Yeah , they 're inside dogs . 

Well , that 's , that 's neat . They 're my babies . Yeah . Well , what are the colors in your house ? Uh , um , kind of a mauve and gray . Oh , I bet that 's pretty . Uh-huh , and then the kitchen 's kind of a , a country pink and country blue , and -- Uh-huh . -- it 's all done in cows , I 'm a cow nut . 

Oh , that 's neat . I like cows , too . Uh-huh -- Yeah -- -- so . -- well , our house was redo , uh , our house is very old also -- Uh-huh . -- it 's like thirty-seven years old -- Wow . -- yeah , and it was redone before we moved in , which , I 'm thankful for that , but the , it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in -- Yeah . -- everything is -- Yeah . -- like , the carpet 's kind of a tan and brown -- Uh-huh . -- and has , um , paneling in the living room , and lots of , lots of tans and lots of browns -- Uh-huh . -- but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that -- Oh , yeah , yeah , -- you know , so , uh , that 's worked out good . In the , in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan , um , wallpaper -- Uh-huh . -- had done it up with blues , so that 's nice , Oh , sounds pretty . yeah , we 've enjoyed living here . It 's close to my , uh , oldest daughter 's school -- Oh . -- and that makes it really handy , too -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- and she really likes her school , so -- Good . -- and we are so close to shopping and ... That 's an important factor there . Yeah , how about in Coppell ? I 've always imagined it kind of out , away from everything . Well , you know , now we have that new mall in Lewisville -- 

Oh , really , -- and that 's just like a mile or two from our house -- Oh , well , that 's nice . -- but , when we first moved to Coppell , it 's what , six years ago , we did n't even have a grocery store -- Oh , wow , -- and now we have four -- Oh . -- and Coppell 's not really big enough to support fo- , four grocery stores -- Yeah , yeah -- -- so , 

-- but it does sound like it 's definitely growing . Oh , much -- Yeah . -- very much . In fact , it 's about the size now , I moved down here from Chicago , what , twenty-three years ago -- Oh , uh-huh . 

-- and , to Lewisville -- Uh-huh . -- and Coppell 's now about the size that Lewisville was when , when I moved down here . Oh , I see . Well , when we first moved here , we moved here from Lubbock -- Uh-huh . -- and we almost moved to Lewisville , that was -- 

Oh really , -- our second choice , yeah , behind Garland , we , at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home ,
