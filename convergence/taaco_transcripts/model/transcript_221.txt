All right . What , what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation ? I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force . Yeah . Few are , uh , basically staying home and being homemakers , and raising kids exclusively . Uh-huh . Yeah , I , I , I grew up in , uh , sixties and early seventies and , uh , my mom did n't work at all when I was growing up . She did n't start working until I was , um , well into high school . Uh-huh . So , I , I had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids , it 's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids . Yeah , true . Well , mine taught kindergarten but she was always , uh , I guess her schedule was shorter so she was always , uh , Always home by the time you got home . home , yeah . Yeah , that , that statistic I guess has been growing every year it 's like something around sixty , sixty-five percent or so now . Uh-huh . 

Uh , I 'm not sure what the future holds for that whether , It seems like there 's , it seems that there 's a grass roots , um , effort or whatever going on I , I , um , clean houses part-time , Uh-huh . and almost all the people that I clean for , believe it or not , are mothers that do n't work . Huh . Um , That 's unusual . they are , th- , they 're all , um , it 's , and it 's , I think it 's kind of a new movement 

it 's going back towards , you know , women have come into the work force in the last twenty , thirty years and now they 're wanting to go back to the old days where , you know , women stayed home with the kids , you know , and try to give the kids quality time . Uh-huh . And I , I think that in the future you 're , I think you 're going to see a lot more , um , women choosing to not work after they have a baby . Yeah . Um , I think with , uh , the , uh , the work force with the , the salaries that a lot of , a lot of the women that I work for have husbands who are , um , vice-presidents of companies and I think with , uh , um , this , it seems like it 's more the upper-class people , Uh-huh . um , I do n't see it as much , the , like in my situation where I do n't , I do n't have children yet , but ideally I would like to be able to stay home with my kids . But realistically that 's , I 'm , I 'm realizing that 's probably not going to be possible , um , for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income . Yeah , that is tough . Yeah , we 're looking at that now , my wife 's about six months along . Uh-huh . 

I think it 's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids . Uh-huh . You know , it 's going to kind of kind of go along with the B M W in the driveway and , or in the garage or whatever . True . Um , and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever . Yeah . 

I 'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home . I would think it would be women that were working full-time . Yeah , believe it or not though the , all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home . Huh . Um , they 're real active in volunteer work . Uh-huh . Um , one of the women is real active with , uh , Muscular Dystrophy . And , uh , does a lot of , of work with them on a volunteer basis but it 's still , it 's almost like a job , she just does n't get paid for it . Huh . Well , I guess that 's good that they , they 've got something to keep them active . Yeah . When , when your wife has her baby , is she going to stay home or is she going to , Yeah , we 're , go back to work ? we 're going to try and have her stay home , for as long as possible . What do you think ? That , that , that , I would , I would like to be able to do that . Yeah , we think it 's , uh , that important and I , I kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction . I 'm a , a counselor and a therapist , Uh-huh . and I work with adolescents , and I see some of the problems the kids have when they do n't have a real good family structure . Yeah , I , I see a difference in the generation of , even the generation before me , Uh-huh . uh , were , you know , mom was like , um , Mrs Cleaver , uh , you know , June Cleaver or whatever , where the , the attitudes were a lot different . Um , as far as , I think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more , um , ther- , there was n't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and , Uh-huh . um , a lot of the , the things that are going on in today 's society , I think morally , um , it seems like there was , peo- , people were a lot better back then as far as hig , higher standards . True . Well , the husbands ' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure and with women working so much they 're kind of pulled out of it too . Yeah . So , kids are raised around their friends and by the media . Yeah , that 's true . And that 's , you know , that 's contributed , And I think , I think you 're going to see a lot more of that in the future . Yeah , maybe that 's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time , so . If there was some way for , for women to , to stay home even if they could work , you know , there are a lot of jobs that are coming about , like in computers at home , Uh-huh . and those types of things , that would at least in some ways , um , bridge the gap . Yeah , I , I think that , um , in the future , um , the , the family unit as it , as it once was known , is , is going to be nonexistent . What , how do you , what do you think ? About ? That as far as do , do you think there 's going to be still a family unit or , or do you think that , um , the trend is going more towards single parenting ? The balance I do n't , the , the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so and it got higher than that for a while . Um , that 's hard to say . Families are such a strange configuration anymore . Um , I , I see a lot of families where , you know , in the , in the back , I grew up about the same time you did , Uh-huh . and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible . Uh-huh . Uh , nowadays it 's not the case , kids do n't , kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk and one of the reasons , I guess , is because there 's so much more income in the family with both parents working . They get bombarded with junk and they do n't have to do anything around the house . They never learned to be responsible when , Yeah . the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while and they come back , and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad so , Yeah . you know , you create a bigger , bigger family , generation after generation but not really on purpose . Yeah . So . It 's not , not a real functional situation anyway . So , you know , I do n't know it 's , I do n't know that that trend 's going to change the single parent type families and the MUMBLEx families , as long as we 've got so many other crazy things going on in society . Yeah , I , I think that eventually the , the family unit 's just not going to even exist anymore . MUMBLEx like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that I think there 's going to be more single parent families than there are , um , you know , two parent families . Uh-huh . That 's pretty sad . Yeah , it is , I guess unless , unless there 's a , a major swing in the change of what 's important to people , you know , probably keep going downhill . And I , I do n't know we , we feel like that , that we can make it on one income it , it may be tough but we may have to give up on some , some things . I , I think in the long run though your child will benefit from that . Yeah . And it will , it will make the , the strain worthwhile . Yeah , I think so too . Well , I , I need to go ahead and , and wrap it up . Okay . Um , it was really nice talking to you . Well , I 've enjoyed it , Stephanie . And , uh , thanks a lot . Uh-huh . Okay , bye-bye . Bye-bye .
