Okay . Okay . What 's , what 's your most recent one that you 've seen ? Well actually , what I do , I have n't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months , Uh-huh . so I have n't really seen any movies in the movie theater but I rent probably four or five movies a week . Really , I used to do that too , but I have n't been doing it lately but , We 've got a good video place out here 

and , uh , uh , oh gosh , uh , I 'm just trying to think of all the movies I 've recently seen . Uh , oh , AIR AMERICA . No , see , I have n't seen that one , uh . Have you seen WILD ORCHID ? No , is it good ? Well , it depends , do you like , uh , steamy movies . Uh , no , 

not ye- , I know that sounds funny coming from a woman , but usually I do n't . Oh , okay , what type of movies do you like ? Um , action . Bu- , d- , I , I guess one of my favorite , well two of my favorite movies is probably like LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO . Okay . And those are , those are like two of my most favorite , I mean they 're just really good movies . And I liked BIRD ON A WIRE . Yeah . And movies like that . Do you like suspense movies or do you like , uh , just action or , Um , yeah , some , I guess like , what do you mean like , like are you talking about movies like DIE HARD TWO . Oh , JAGGED EDGE , Okay , yeah , I liked that , that was pretty good . Um , that was okay , I , I do n't , I guess I thought it was too far fetched but so many people said oh , no it was n't , you know . But I guess , 

Oh , well I hope I do n't run across them . Really , that 's true because , I do n't know , I just did n't find that one to be real , I , I just thought it was too far fetched . What was your favorite all time movie ? Um , oh gosh , I don , I ca n't think off my head . Do you know which one yours was ? I , I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most , uh , that I was really the most in shock with was probably , uh , STAR WARS . Oh , yeah , well that 's , When that first came out , I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that . Right . I mean , I guess , uh , out of all the movies , I 've , I 've never been as excited to go back . I was ready to go back and see it again , you know Really . Yeah , yeah , you 're right about that , but that that 's really like an all time classic . I mean , I do n't think anybody , anything could ever beat that . Now , I , I also liked , uh , oh , GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic , like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA . See , I 've never seen that . Oh , you have n't ? No , should I rent it ? Oh , yeah . 

Should I go rent it tomorrow . No , that 's , uh , that 's a , that 's a real interesting movie and it 's got a good historical perspective to it . That 's probably something I need to see right now because I 'm taking history in school . Oh , yeah . Actually , I just saw a movie , uh , called THE LOST CAPONE . And it 's about Al Capone 's brothers . 

Oh , really . Primarily one of his brothers , and I wo n't give the , the whole plot away but it 's , it 's really a good movie . Uh , Al Capone had three brothers , Uh-huh . and one of them was lost for many , many years and , uh , he actually , he turns out to be a law man . Really . Yeah , it 's really interesting it , Oh , you just gave it away , 

I guess I ca n't go see it , no . No , that 's okay , I did n't give away the whole thing , I just gave away just enough to get you interested . That does sound good , is it one , I guess it 's a rental . Yeah , 

it is . Okay , I may have to do that . Go see it , or go rent it . And , a lot of times , what I wind up doing is , picking say an actor or an actress , Yeah . 

and seeing like all , I 've seen all of James Dean 's movies . Uh-huh . Uh , all of Mae West 's movies . And , just kind of , kind of go out and , uh , rent all the movies and , uh , uh , you know , just kind of go , I guess you could do that , you know , get all of David Carradine 's movies , Uh-huh . or , uh , uh , Segal , to , what 's his first name . I ca n't remember his first name . Um , it 's not David is it ? 

Is it David Segal . I do n't know , he was on , uh , on , uh , uh , Arsenio , just recently . 

Oh , I do n't , I do n't watch that . Um , It was really kind of interesting because , Really . Arsenio was asking him about , uh , what he thought of , uh , one of the other action guys . God , I ca n't even remember the name . He said well , he would n't really talk about it . Did n't want to talk about him because he did n't think he was such a , uh , a good action guy . Huh . It was n't Stallone , it was , uh , I ca n't remember . Shoot , I ca n't remember the guy 's name . But I like all the , the RAMBO movies . Oh , see , I did n't really care , that 's , that 's one side of the action I guess that I did n't really care for but see I do n't really like Sylvester Stallone . Yeah . I do n't think he 's really a very good actor . I know that sounds awful because so many people think he 's so wonderful but I just have never been a Stallone fan . Yo , Adrian . Hey that 's pretty good . No , I guess like I say , I just have , I do n't know , I just have never seen any interest in him , but . No , we , we actually rent , uh , probably a go , good combination of movies with the exception of horror films . Oh . Do n't watch really very many horror films at all . Yeah , I do n't either . You know , I do n't know , there 's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you , or something , you know , Yeah , you 're right . coming out of the T V that just does n't make my day , you know . Well it 's so , I guess , I 'm a real , I 'm a realist , and so , when I watch movies like that , it 's like this can not happen . So , I just do n't enjoy it , you know , because it 's just like , come on , give me a break . Yeah . You know , I mean , I just and so many of them are done so poorly , Yeah . you know that , it just does n't even give you the effect , I mean some of them are done good and they do scare you . But , um , so many of them are just done real , I do n't know , I 'm not really into those . I just saw , uh , uh , a really interesting movie called , uh , FLATLINERS . Oh , that was one of my favorites , yes . I thought that was a very good movie . Yeah . I was really impressed with that one . I mean it was , what I liked about it was that it was a new subject . Nobody had ever touched it before . Yeah . You know , and it was just , it was done so well , you know , it was just , It was just crazy enough for th- , you know students might try to do it . You know , I mean , and it 's not like there 's a lot of scientific data on it . Right , well that 's probably true . But it was a very good movie . It was done real well too . I mean there was n't any part of it that you really felt like , no , this ca n't happen . It seemed re , it seemed real , you know it was really good . Yeah . That , that was one , I mean it 's not my all time favorite movie but it was good , it was really good . Yeah . And , um , I do n't know if you like this kind , but I thought PRETTY WOMAN was a really good movie , too . Oh , yeah , that was a great movie . Yeah , I 've , we 've seen that two or three times . We waited and we rented it , Yeah . you know , but , but it was really good . Uh , have you seen SHRIMP ON THE BARBY ? No , I have n't , I do n't know if I 've even heard of that one . Ye- , ye- , yeah , it 's got , It must have , uh , what 's his name in it . No . No it does n't , No . Really . Uh , Hogan ? Yeah , Paul Hogan . No , No , really , I 'm surprised . no it 's got , uh , uh , Cheech Marin . Oh really , that must be pretty good then , was it good . Yeah , it is , it 's kind of , uh , kind of a poor man 's PRETTY WOMAN in reverse . Oh . But it was kind of cute . Actually did you see DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS ? Yes , yes . I though that was a really cute movie , I enjoyed that . Yeah , it was . TWINS was good too , because when I thought of that , I thought of , anyway . Um , oh , there was another one , what 's the one that just , oh , DANCES WITH WOLVES , have you seen that yet ? No , I have n't . Oh , you 've got to see that one , it 's really , I hear that 's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video . Right , that 's probably true , that 's probably true . It 's , it 's very , very good . Very good . Yeah . That 's another one that , I was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it . Well my wife , uh , has got a , uh , a picture from Kevin Costner and he signed it . It 's from DANCES WITH WOLVES . Really . Yeah , and he signed it . He , he happens to be , uh , a friend of one of her , her business associates . Oh , wow , that 's impressive . And , or , not , not a friend , a cousin , a cousin . Oh , neat . So , uh , uh , but anyhow we got , uh , we got a nice , uh , picture and it came in an envelope that says DANCES WITH WOLVES so we 've got to , uh , try to get out there and see that one . Oh , yeah , it 's really worth it . I mean it 's a very good movie and yes , I would suggest seeing it at the theater . I know that they 're still playing it and they pushed it back , to playing it in the theaters until like August , Huh . I , think because they were , they were scheduling a video release of it in July and then when it won all those awards , uh , they pushed it back to August , so . But , yeah , that one is definitely worth seeing , it 's really good . Now did you see , uh , DRIVING MISS DAISY ? Yeah , and you know , I did n't think that one was near as good . Okay . You know , I guess it was okay , I mean it was all right , but , um , when I compare like the winners of this year and last year , it just , I do n't know . Maybe , it 's , it 's not ,
