So how do you , uh , so , so , it sounds like you 've got a television going on there , so I can assume that you probably watch the T V news . Is that , I almost never watch T V news . Really ? Wow . I , I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio . Uh , what , what station do you listen to ? Uh , it 's a local radio station . It 's called , uh , K L I F , cliff . Cliff , I see , so , uh , it 's not affiliated with anything , is it . Not -- No . -- it 's not a network station . No . Okay , yeah , because I , I listen to , uh , public radio a lot and they have , they have K C R W , which I , I , I saw a thing recently , they may be trying to start their own , uh , cable TV outlet , I guess . They 're getting a little , getting a little feisty now . 

Well , this has , this station has a lot of just ongoing news -- Uh , -- and occasionally in the morning , I 'll pick up something like , uh , C N N or that , but I hate watching the , like , ten o'clock news or , Yeah , 

so you have a paper or something or , Yeah , we have a lo- , well , we have , uh , DALLAS MORNING NEWS which is the big paper in Dallas . Uh-huh . We read , I read it pretty much -- Yeah . -- from cover to cover . How do you like it ? 

It 's been , it 's been a while since I read the Dallas news . I , uh , fact , last time I read the Dallas , Dallas news I was in Arkansas . I , uh , The TIMES HERALD went out of business here -- Oh , yeah ? 

-- and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one , Fort Worth newspaper . Well , that must be pretty bad . So , how did that happen , anyway ? 

Uh , financial trouble . No , not how , I mean , when did it , when did they MUMBLEx , Oh , when did it happen ? Yeah . I guess they closed down about three months ago . Oh , really . Um . 

So , how do you keep up ? Oh , me , I , uh , good grief , I read the TIMES , LOS ANGELES TIMES . There 's , quite a task if you 've ever run into one . They 're , uh -- Yes , they 're very -- -- speci , -- voluminous . Yeah , they 're thick . Uh , if there 's something you want to know , it 's , it 's in the TIMES and then , and in detail . Uh , they , uh , we , we used to have two papers here in town and then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of , oh , I do n't know , just nobody was buying it really . So there really is only one major L A now ? Yeah , pretty much . 

Uh , there used to be , fact , I think there still is , the , uh , the DAILY NEWS which runs out of the San Fernando Valley and , uh , they 're not bad as far as a , uh , you know , as far as a local paper goes . In fact , it was kind of weird , because I met the , uh , I met the , I met the editor , uh , while I was on , uh , while I was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time . It was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff . He was a really cool guy . Uh , you know , went to Columbia University and all this stuff . And , uh it 's , it 's a pretty good paper , but , uh , you know , it 's not , it 's not the TIMES . Yeah . Although I , you know , I 'm sorry to see some of their , uh , there 's , there 's a daily news , uh , news rack right around the corner from where I live , which means that they 're , they 're expanding , I guess . But , uh , a- , and occasionally I , I pick up like TIME magazine or something I think , uh , if they 've got an interesting lead story , but you know , it 's , I , I do n't have time . 

I used to read TIME magazine a lot , but I do n't read it much anymore . Yeah , that 's , that 's kind of a problem for them . There 's a lot of people who fall into that , category . 

And then we have a local rag here in town that -- Uh-huh . -- I pick up periodically and read just to see what 's going on in our little community . I see . Because we do n't get an awful lot of coverage in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS . Yeah , the big dailies do n't like to , do n't like to step much out of their , uh , out of their home turf , I have to admit , the TIMES is kind of provincial , too . It 's basically anything that 's south of downtown , they do n't bother to cover . Now , they have started here running a three day , or three times a week Plano section . Uh-huh . And it 's just sort of a , you know , four or five pages that covers what 's going on in Plano . But it 's still not an awful lot of news . Yeah , I know . 

I , uh , it was , it was a big discovery when , when the TIMES , when the TIMES found out there was a place called Orange County . I mean , the way they , I mean , the way they 've been handling it before , they practically , they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the L A county border . Oh , I would imagine in , uh , you know , in , in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover , that it gets hard covering all of the sub- , suburbs and , of course , they tend to cover the county , and we 're not in Dallas county , so they -- Oh , really ? -- tend to ignore places outside of the county . Yeah , yeah , I , I , I find that attitude kind of arrogant , though . 

It 's like you 're taking our money , but you 're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us . Yeah .
