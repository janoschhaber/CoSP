Do you have any particular thoughts about the school system ? Well , um , I , I think that in , in , uh , recently with the , I 'm not sure if it 's more a problem with American families or a problem with the school system . They seem to be burdening the school system more and more with problems , any problems that a child might have , whether it 's actually a school related thing or not and , I . I say agree with you a hundred percent there . Yeah , and , and , well , it 's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything . Yeah . If , uh , you 've some kid who does n't have , uh , who 's from a broken family , the schools are supposed to fill that void . uh , you know , teaching classes -- Yeah . -- and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like , oh , were kind of traditionally the school 's roles . Yeah , it 's interesting because , uh , we 're just having conversation on this , uh , with a couple of people yesterday . 

And I was expressing my frustrations that , uh , some of the , so many problems , I work in a high school , are that kids do n't have a , a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large . Uh , and you ca n't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract , uh , sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home . Right . Um , and , it 's seen more so because when you call parents up , many parents wo n't even recognize that there is a problem and I 'll say , they 'll say , oh , well , our kids , my kid , I 've never heard anything about this before . This is the first time there have been problems . And , and , you wonder , do n't these parents know that teachers talk , and , you know , we do check with other teachers , and other teachers find the same things in -- Right . -- this child . And , you know , how do you tell your parent 's , the parent , hey , wake up , and smell the coffee . Right . But , um , it , it is a problem , and I 'm not sure just , uh , how , how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it . Yeah . Whether maybe through a commitment of the P T A , uh , and the parents being informed better , that in fact that the problems that are nationwide -- Yeah . -- are problems , um , of society , and that , that the school can only do so much on it . 

Well , then , then again when you have , uh , a society where a certain percentage of the parents are , uh , doing drugs in the home -- Uh-huh . -- uh , either unemployed and do n't care about a , uh , just a have their own problems -- Yeah , yeah . -- how , how do you expect the school to , um , or how do you expect the , you ca n't really expect that parent who 's , quite frankly -- That 's right . -- a loser in life , as it is -- Uh-huh . -- to , to care about the , the situation with their child , and , You know what scares me too , is that we have yet to see other , the biggest effect of the crack children -- Right . 

-- uh , in the school system . These are children that are born with low deficit , attention deficit -- Right . -- and , gosh , what 's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system . That 's really scary . Yeah . But there are , I think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve , and this is something that I see . Too many times students get diagnosed as mo- , slow learners , and in fact they 're not . They 're behavior problems . Right . And so , they get put in , in , in our school system , in a class that 's limited for skills children -- Uh-huh . -- that have , really have to master skills . And that 's not their problem . Um , at the same time , I 've seen , we , we have a , an international population . There 's no bridge area for students coming out of the E S O L , which is English for Speakers of Other Languages -- Uh-huh . -- program . The , once they 're past E S O L , they get out , they got thrown right into the total mainstream -- Right . -- and , uh , there really needs to be a bridge , some sort of transition -- Right . -- for that . So the school systems can improve , both in standing up for splitting classes , you know , having learning dis- , learning , slow , slow children in slow classes , but not mixing them with behavior problems . Right . And then , you know , the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes , you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated . Right . And then you throw in kids that are not motivated , maybe bright , but they 're discipline problems . And you sometimes the average classes really are problems -- Uh-huh . -- because you 've got such a mixed bag there . Right . You know , the gifted and talented are fast classes . There 's really not that much of a problem with . But it 's , Well , I , I 've seen more , uh , incredibly intelligent underachievers than , -- Uh-huh . 

-- than , uh , I personally I will , I would take a person who 's motivated and a little , uh , less intelligent -- That 's , yeah . -- than the person who , uh , is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of , is n't motivated to do anything . I remember I had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration , and ninety-nine percent perspiration . Yeah . 

Well , I , not to toot my own horn here or anything , but I , I was graduated from my high school , I was the valedictorian , and I know -- Uh-huh . -- that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me , and they proved out late when it came time to take the S A T -s . Mine were -- Uh-huh . -- good , but they were n't great . Uh-huh . And , uh , when I got into college I struggled , I struggled just to , uh , get my degree in the , in the field that I was in . Yeah . Whereas I knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all , but they got motivated in college and they did a lot better than I did . And when it , Yeah . I guess kids do mature at different ages -- Right . -- too . That 's , and , you know , as a teacher you , you try to make , be understanding that , you know , there are different ages , kids are , is this a , got a kid that just a question of maturity , or is he a -- Uh-huh . -- problem child . But teachers are asked to diagnose so much . Um , there , I mean , I mean we 're , have to be , we 're alerted -- Right . -- there 's all sorts of systems where suicide , uh , predisposition . I mean , we 're alerted to what the moment we see something . If we see a child that we have any reason , that 's on drugs , such as if he 's got a beeper or if they 're , if they 're flashing lots of money around . We 've , there are certain things to do . I mean , so tea- , the school system 's asked to do so much , but you ca n't operate in a vacuum . You actually have students with , with beepers ? This is a , we 're in a rather wealthy suburb of Washington . Uh-huh . And a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the , uh , principal . I mean , where , what are the , what could they possibly be thinking . I mean how . It 's for drug use . They ca n't imagine for anything else . Yeah Yeah . You know , it 's , it 's amazing , but uh , you get all sorts , you get all , all sorts of things , uh , in the schools , uh , uh , and it 's , and you know , as a teacher you 're alert , you 're alert for the kid who 's very drowsy . You 're alert to the kid who suddenly has a , um , behavioral change , and you refer them to the nurse . Right . And , so , I mean , you have to find out whether there 's a legitimate reason , or whether this is a warning signal . Yeah , can you , how can you , how can you expect to , Oh yeah , I , I , I was , uh , sitting in the barber shop . I 'm an officer in the Air Force , and I was having my hair cut -- Uh-huh . -- and the barber got a call while I was there , uh , from his son 's school . His son 's in high school . And his son was failing gym and , uh , and having trouble , with a few other things . But , you know , it 's like , uh , this guy was like , why now , there 's no problem with my kid . My kid 's a great kid and all this . The kid had missed all these classes , and basically -- Uh-huh . -- he , his answer was , Oh , I gave him permission to , to miss . Yeah , 

the denial mechanism is really strong and so many parents are facilitators . Yeah . I mean , they 're manipulated by their children . Right . I 've been fortunate . I have , uh , a son who 's a sophomore in college up in Massachusetts -- Uh-huh . -- at , uh , Amherst , and my other son is a senior in high school , and he 's going on to Williams . And I mean , they 're really super . They 're both national level -- Sure . -- swimmers , and where we 've been very fortunate , but , you know , they had to be held accountable -- Right . -- too . I mean , you know , at some point a parent does help their kid , but in , in some ways , but , but you have to say at what point is n't the help becoming negative . Sure . And I think this is where the school system at , is suffering , and not through any fault of the effort -- Right . -- of the school system . But gee it was good talking with you . It was good talking to you too . Yeah , 

so there are people throughout the country that feel -- Yeah . -- the same ways that you do , and , and are connected with the schools . Yeah , I 've had interesting conversations on several subjects not , uh , not just this but different , the different -- Uh-huh . 

-- things . It 's amazing how the , you know , people you talk to have some interesting conversations and , uh , it 's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base , and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used at all . Well , we are , though . Yeah , that 's true . Listen , good luck . Take care , Yep . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
