What are you guys having for Christmas ? What are we having ? Let 's see . Well , I 'm not planning the menu . 

Oh , you 're not . No . We usually go out to ei- , either one of our folks , they both live close to -- Yeah . -- but , um , I do n't know , it seems like a , a big thing for Christmas is usually ham . Well , funny you should mention that . I 'm a pig farmer . Oh , you are -- Yeah . 

-- huh . Well , now , it 's kind of a hobby more than anything else , but we 're going to have , uh , wild boar -- My goodness . -- we , uh , we killed a boar the other day , it was , you know , mating with the sows , and you ca n't use the piglets , you know , so . Huh . It 's about six months of no use , so , we , uh , we shot him and cleaned him out and had him , you know , processed into ham , and , uh , we 're also going to have a little roast suckling pig , because I , I 've got one that 's got a , a hernia -- Oh , really . -- and rather than , you know , pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery , we 'll just cook him and eat him . Is that , is that hard ? Well , no , hey , I tell you what , preparing a little pig is , is a snap , I 'm telling you , real easy , easier than chicken . Oh , really . Yeah , you just , uh , you kill him , you know , you probably , most guys just shoot them in the head , they go , you know , in a second they 're gone -- Oh . -- and then you just dip the carcass in , uh , boiling water , pull it out , and there 's a , we use a little raspy brush , pulls the hair off , and , uh , gut it , and , uh , just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and , uh , some pineapple , about three pineapples , you know , sliced them up , and , uh , cover him up with , uh , wet , uh , sacks , feed sacks is what I usually use -- Huh . -- and then start a charcoal fire on top of him . Oh , my goodness . And after about six hours , you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there , and it 's the best eating you ever had . Oh , well , does a boar taste just like regular ham ? Yep , 

just like a pig -- Does it . -- I mean , you know , uh , it has a lot less fat . Huh . This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds -- Oh my . -- and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds . 

Oh , my goodness . Well , you know , we took the skin and the head and the le- , and the feet off , and that was about , you know , a hundred , hundred pounds of just ham . Oh , well , how many people are you planning on serving at Christmas ? Oh , well , we 're , you know , we 're not going to eat the whole thing . Eat it all , yeah . It would take a year . But , uh , you know , we 're going to drive up to Kansas City , see my wife 's folks , and , uh , she , she , what 's , what 's what 's your mother cooking for Christmas , yeah , well her mom 's doing brisket . I do n't , what is brisket ? Brisket ? It 's a part of the cow that they used to throw away . Huh . It 's just tough as a boot -- Oh . -- and , uh , you know , they used to use it for leather , I think . Oh , my goodness . I mean , no , I was kidding . Yeah . But , uh , it 's , it 's a part of the loin , you know , the rib cage , and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of , 

gristle where it attaches to the ribs , so it 's really , really a tough piece of meat -- Oh , my goodness . -- but it 's so tasty , you ca n't stand it . Huh . 

So you just take it and you marinate it for a couple of days -- And that softens it up , huh . 

-- MUMBLEx . Huh . And then , uh , you just put it in the oven , takes about four hours to cook one . They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds . Oh , gee . And , uh , we 're going to have that . 

Well , what else do you serve with your pig ? Oh , well , we 'll have cranberries and hominy and , uh , we , we are , we 're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here . Huh . We have oliv- , olives , black olives and cucumbers and , uh , tomatoes , we still have tomatoes -- Oh , do you ? -- yeah , fresh tomatoes . 

Oh , we , we just got lots of snow . Well , it started to freeze up around here , you know , there 's nothing between you and us but our barb wire , and half of that 's down . I mean it 's thirty degrees this morning . 

Oh , really . Yeah . Huh . But , uh , it 'll go up to fifty or sixty almost . Oh , my goodness . 

I did n't know it got that low at night . Oh , yeah . Well , it 's desert , you know , where , where we are , it 's , it 's , it 's , uh , the edge of the desert , I mean , it 's part of the Great Plains . So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred , hundred and ten -- Oh , gee . -- and at night it goes down to about sixty . My goodness . Yeah , we get a fifty de- , degree temperature swing in about four hours . Oh , boy . So everything that lives around here is real tough . Oh . That 's trees , you know , we got hundred year old trees that are , you know , twenty feet tall . Oh , gee . That 's all the bigger they get , they , you know , they 're just hard as a rock .
