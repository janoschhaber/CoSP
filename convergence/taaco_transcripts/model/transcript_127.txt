Uh , well what would you say your opinion is on gun control ? Well , I do n't know . I 've , I 've had mixed emotions , I guess , when I listen to , uh , the radio and , and watch T V about the different , uh , things that are happening . Uh , I 'm against it but on the same token , uh , I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that . Ye- , So I , I have a rifle in the house . Uh , the ammunition is probably so old I 'm afraid to use it . But , uh , I bought it for target practicing and , uh , and also because I wanted a weapon . Uh , how do you feel about it ? Well , I think , uh , down here in Texas they do n't have a waiting period on handguns . Huh . And , I think they need that . Uh , and I do have a , I have a pistol . It 's a little twenty-two and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun . Uh-huh . An- , you know , I do like to have my guns .  Uh , I do n't know if I 'll ever use it , you know . And like you , my bullets to my little pistol 's probably , uh , about three years old . Uh , my gun has n't been shot in a year or two . Uh-huh . But , uh , I like to have them where handy . Well , up , uh , up in New England where I 'm from , uh , you had to get a permit before you could buy any amu- , am- , ammunition . And I thought that was really good . And I think if they , uh ,  

takes two weeks for that system to process , uh , your request for , uh , not as a gun permit but , uh , but to buy ammunition . You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that . I 've never heard of anything like that . Yeah . Uh , That would be nice . But ,  a- , you know , the criminals that are going to get their guns one -- I -- -- way or the other . -- I , I agree . I think , you know , one of the things that , that , that needs to happen is , uh , to , to stop the impulse buyer from , uh , buying it quickly and , and , uh ,  maybe putting a week 's waiting period or something on it . But if someone 's really determined to , to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place . Yeah And you can get them really cheap . I know 

I , I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in , uh , Tennessee . Uh-huh . And , uh , they had a waiting period and , uh , we bought it there . And , How long was the waiting period out there ? 

About nine days . Huh . That was n't too , too bad . No . No . Because if , if you 're going to go buy something , uh , uh , of that nature , I think you , you 're going to have some idea as to what you 're going to do with it . You 're not going to react that quickly . In other words , you know , you do n't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day . Th- , 

somebody wants to do that , I , I , at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms . Yeah . I do too . Uh , because it does n't make any difference , uh , uh , whether it 's a pistol or a shotgun , I suppose . They both do the same kind of job . A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does . Uh , yeah . I suppose . I never got shot with either one . But I do n't know , uh , I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun . No , a shotgun 's got too much of a spread . Or at -- Yeah . -- least ours does . Uh , it 's , you know , you have a little , uh , thing on the bo- , bottom of th- , on top of the barrel -- Uh-huh . -- where you , you turn it , you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get . Oh . And the spread changes . Uh , I 've got a manual single shot and I guess it does n't have any , any automatic features to it . The further away I get , the , the , uh , wider the shot gets -- Yeah . 

-- from the target . And the closer that I get , the tighter that it gets . It 's got a hell of a kick to it . Yeah . 

My husband had a , uh , a police gun at one time . And I shot that thing one time . Almost knocked me down .  And it just a li- , I don- , I forget , I think it was a three fifty-seven . I 'm not sure . Do you belong to a gun club or you ? He belonged to one awhile back . Uh , since we moved , 

we 've only been here in Texas for about a year -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , we ca n't even find a place to shoot . Just for -- No kidding . -- target practice . I 'd love to get used to that shotgun . We traded his pistol for that shotgun . Huh . Well the , the , uh , clubs that we 've got around here are kind of expensive but , uh , it 's well worth it . 

You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have , uh , competition . Uh , I 've never really joined a club because I have n't got the time . Not because I have n't got the desire . Uh , there 's an annual membership fee , uh , that 's , that 's fairly high . Plus there 's ini- , an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time , uh , uh , member .  So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club . Plus you have to pay for the , the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in . Yeah . Well , that 's what my husband , when he was in that gun club where he was doing that . It , you know , he went mostly just to , uh , shoot at paper targets . Uh-huh . 

Uh , but , you know , they used speed and accuracy and all that . I think that , that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose . In fact , I 'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to , uh , show that you 've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon . That 's a good , I 've never thought of that .  That 's a good point . And , you know , it , it , even after you wait your nine days , if you do n't know how to handle it , it 's just like putting someone in an automobile that does n't know how to drive . And you give him a license because he waited nine days . Yeah . That 's , and , yeah . 

He could , he could not only , uh , uh , shoot himself . He could , he could , uh , mishandle a weapon . Leave it at home and let a child get at it . It , well we , uh , we was living on a navy base down in Memphis 

and , uh , this one guy decided to play , uh , lonesome cowboy or something . And he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot . Wow . He was fortunate . He could , he could of hit something else . Well , he went tumbling down the steps along with , uh , shooting his foot almost off . He broke his leg and -- Wow . -- collar bone and a couple of other things I 'm sure , being ,  Mister Cowboy . I ca n't remember what the na- , the term was going around . It was about four or five years ago .  

But . Now , I guess that would be a good idea . About , uh , private citizens selling a weapons ? Like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me . How do you feel about that ? Do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the , uh , buyer and the seller ? And , or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system , uh ,  because you own it ? Uh , that 's a hard one because we did that . But , uh , I think there ought to be some rule against it . I 'll , uh , you know , the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun 's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something , the cops are going to come to you . Yeah . I , is n't -- Uh , -- there a way to , uh , to deregister yourself after you register a gun ? 

I have no idea . I 've only -- Because I -- -- had one gun and I 've kept it , you -- -- have , -- know , the one gun that was in my name . Yeah . Is it registered ? Yeah . I- , The , uh , the rifle that I 've got is not registered ,  and , uh , I do n't know why I never registered it but the , uh , I do n't think you have to register a shotgun . Um , I , I think it 's , it 's voluntary . The , uh , the , Well , see , uh , my husband has a thing . If they go to , uh , regulating , uh , all right , uh , banning guns . Pri , pri , pri , private cit- , citizens -- Yeah . -- this , my kid is jumping on me . I ca n't hardly talk .  My husband feels that they 'll come and collect everybody 's guns . Yeah . I guess that could happen . It 's just like the , uh , the social security system . Once they , uh , they gave everybody a number and now they 're making you , uh , uh , get one at , at birth .  And -- Yeah . -- once they have your number , they have your identification . 

And if you try to do anything , uh , like , uh , not identify yourself to the government , they know who you are . Yeah . And everything about you . And , that 's true . Uh , I , 

bu- , bu- , you know , they know so , how much money you make a week to , uh , probably your , uh , my kid is banging . I was seeing what they was banging on . Uh , I 've lost my train of thought . I 'm sorry . That 's all right . 

You , you were talking about , uh , uh , -- Oh , the Soc , -- Fed , what the Federal government knows about people . Yeah . They , they probably know everything from , half the time wh , ho , what time you go to the bathroom . 

They probably do . No , that 's that 's a little bit extreme . But they could know anything and everything about you . And , uh , I 'd like to have my gun . If they go to banding , banning them , I 'd lose my gun but we would n't lose our pis- , our , uh , shotgun . Yeah . And , uh , we 're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about . Uh-huh . But I do n't , I do n't , uh , Do you find it difficult picking up , uh , guns that , that are not registered ? No . No . I do n't either . I can , I can buy some , uh , today if I wanted to . Just -- Yeah . W- , -- you know , put up the money . Yeah . 

Well , you can look in the , uh , the , we got a thing down here called A SHOPPER . Uh-huh . It 's a , a ho- , it 's a , it 's a bargain thing . Uh , you go and ever- , you know , always see guns in there . Yeah . Five to seven guns a day . It comes out every Tuesday . And there 's , there 's no waiting period on that . No . None whatsoever .  You call , we sold a refrigerator through it and it took us all of twelve hours . 

To sell the refrigerator ? Yeah . Yeah . You know . And I 'm sure it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun . Huh . And I think the Federal government is , uh , is really far away from , uh , uh , control . I , I do n't believe in , uh , I 'm s- , I should n't probably say control . 

I mean regulation . Control is something that I would n't want the Federal government to have . Uh , but I would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons . Yeah . Well , I agree with you there . They do have too much control over us already . Yeah . Uh , we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have . Unfortunately , we , uh , we vote for the , the people who spend the money , 

so I ca n't complain too much . Yeah , I guess so . I do n't know . They 're ,
