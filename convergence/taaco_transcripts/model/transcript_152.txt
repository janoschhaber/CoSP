Okay . Okay . Well , uh , do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote ? I think it 's somewhere really close to that cause I think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference . And they really do n't listen to any of the issues anymore . Huh . Because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked , you know ? Uh-huh . And so they figure why go out and vote , you know . They 're going to do what they want to do . They 're corrupt anyway . And -- Well , -- I think one of the good ways of solving that is to like , everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party and , uh , you know , like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something . I mean that 's the only , thing that I can figure out because I 've heard so many people say well I 'm not going on voting on that one , you know , I , I 'm going to go fishing today . Or it wo n't make any difference if , if I do n't vote and I think it does . We vote every time . Well , it , uh , there 's no question it does make a difference . 

Uh , so far , as having a party and then all voting , uh , when you have different precincts , MUMBLEx you would have to have a party in every precinct . Right . Because people have to vote in different areas and , uh , not everyone votes at the same place . Uh , I , personally , think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up , with the idea of the , the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference . But , Right . And ma- , maybe let them have some mock , I mean -- Absolutely . -- uh , you know elections and stuff -- Absolutely . -- and vote for different people in their classes and start really young . 

That 's a real good idea . And , and they are are doing that in a number of schools . However , probably not enough of them , uh , country wide . But it 's going to take at least a whole generation of people , uh , to get across the idea of voting . Uh , just like it 's taking a whole generation of people to finally , uh , realize the harmfulness of drugs and -- Right . -- uh , hopefully to , uh , now with the many programs throughout the country on , how to resist taking drugs . How to say no to it and what have you . That , uh , perhaps we 'll finally get the youth weaned off of it . But , uh , I know I , I spent thirty-four years in education here in the Dayton area and in nineteen fifty-one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana , giving away their heroin and what have you , to get them started . Um . And , you know , that was in fifty-one . That 's forty years ago -- God . -- that it was already a problem . So it 's now , uh , to the forefront and people are finally taking some action against it . And the thing , we 've , we 've neglected the value of voting . And -- Right . -- uh , and what it really means to vote and we also do n't make the , uh , the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them . Yeah . Well I do n't know how it is up there but down here , Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all . Uh-huh . I mean , I 'm sure you heard about -- Sure . -- some of ours . Right . And , uh , people are just , I mean it 's like they 're turned off on voting . And that 's the reason I said maybe if you had something like a block party . Uh-huh . Okay , we 're going to have a block party . Everybody 's going to get together . We 're going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then we 're going to go and vote , you know . We 're going to go vote 

like , maybe they could give something like , uh , the top neighborhood , if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that , you know . I mean it does n't have to be , it could be like a , a sign that they would put down at the end of your block . Uh-huh . You know , or anything like that but it , it 's really bad here . I mean to me it is . It seems like people just do n't care anymore . They say , huh , well it do n't make any difference , you know . One crook is as good as the other one . Yeah . And they do n't bother to listen to what any of them have to say . Right . And , uh , I know my husband now we go vote every time . I do n't care how small the ballot is , I -- Uh-huh . Right . -- mean , if there 's one thing , if there 's one issue , because the way I feel is if I do n't vote , then I do n't have any reason , to gripe . To complain about it , right ? Right . Right . And I hear so many people saying well I wish this would change , I wish that and , you know , but they did n't go vote . 

That 's right . And , uh , maybe if they , like you said , if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote -- That 's right . -- and all . Then , uh , and the importance of it because , okay , if you do n't vote for your friend over here , well your friend 's not going to have a chance . Tha- , He needs your vote just like he needs everybody else 's , you know . Maybe if they were brought up that a way , like you said , it would . Because I know here , uh , until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines and you voted for like cheerleaders -- Yes . Uh-huh . -- and different things like that but they should start that a lot earlier . Yeah . I , it 's the same way with everything in education though . It should begin and right down in the first grade . Uh , and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first , second or third grade . So that the children develop good learning patterns 

and you have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning , uh -- Right . -- and not wait until they 're in high school and then it 's too late to try to change them around at that point . Yeah . But , uh , everything should be started on the lower levels and , uh , certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that , you know , they , they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant and -- Right . -- uh , but it , but you 're right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians . And perhaps it 's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run , uh , that only the most wealthy can do so . Right . And they 're not always the best person for the job . Right . But they have the money to be able to do it . So , uh -- Definitely . -- so that there are a lot of problems along that line also . And perhaps the Government , You know a good i- , idea for the young kids like that too , is to have like a a mock one . And , okay , this , this candidate tells -- Sure . -- you some things that are going to happen and this candidate tells you -- Right . -- some things . Okay , then this percentage of the voters , I mean the kids in that class , they are not going to let them vote this time 

but they have to do whatever these people , whichever one the other people -- Uh-huh . -- elect do . If they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them , okay now you 're not going to get to vote but you 're -- Yes . -- going to have to do what that person says , they would understand probably by the time they were -- Right . -- in high school , they 'd be ready to vote . That 's right . And I think , you know , that 's an excellent idea . 

They would put them to realize that , that they 're going to have to do what someone else says even though they did n't vote for it . Yeah . And that maybe they need to think twice about voting . Now some -- Right . -- people object during primaries , having to declare a party , whether Republican or Democrat and -- Uh-huh . -- you do that in the primary . Uh , and I do n't know that , uh , a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason . Uh , they can declare anything they want and they can actually rig it . If they really wanted to vote Republican , they could go in the primary and say they were voting Democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat . But , uh , it 's , uh , it 's just a sad situation and , uh , I do think more needs to be done along that line to help to , uh , teach the people , uh , uh , everyone , uh , more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting . Yeah . So that , uh , we can make , they 're making some more intelligent decisions . And it 's going to take these young -- I think that sounds great . -- you know , it 's going to take the , uh , a whole generation of my feeling , uh , before that 's going to be accomplished . Well , you know , they 'd have to start when they 're real young . 

That 's right . I mean , you know , it would have to be a child that is just coming into school . Because , well I 'll tell you another thing too now . Whenever , the first time I voted , I never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the -- Uh-huh . -- voting machines , now this sounds dumb , but I did not know how to use those voting machines and nobody ever showed us or anything so I did n't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question , all the other kids -- Yeah . -- laughed at them . They thought that was funny . Ah , she do n't even know how , wah , wah . Right . Uh-huh . So there was n't any way I was going to go in there and vote . And it took me , I mean it took such courage you would n't believe -- Sure . -- to go vote the first time because I was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because I -- Right . -- did n't know how to work the machines . Well sure it is . Now that 's bad . And I mean I was out of school . I was a married person . Uh-huh . And , uh , I did n't know how to work the machine , you know . And it really scared me , really bad . Because I thought all these people are going to laugh at me because I do n't know how to work this machine . Where if they 'd , if they 'd had a class or something or just to a short time , you know , to , said okay , this is the way , Well , just the , just the opportunity to try the voting machines , yeah . Right . It 's , this is the way it 's going to be . And my son was exactly the same way that I was and I did n't realize it until , uh , his senior year . I s- , asked him something about well did you , who did you vote for , for , uh , cheerleader ? And he said , oh I did n't go vote . He said , uh , there 's no way I 'm getting in that machine . Well then I realized it so when we went and voted the next time , I asked the , uh , lady , I said I want my son to come in with me and she said well , uh , why , you know . He 'll have to come back out . I said because I want him to know how to use -- Right . -- one of these and I said , I wo n't turn any of the buttons down but I want to show him how to use it so that he 'll be -- Yes . Uh-huh . -- able to vote . And , uh , so he went in and now he 's a -- Good . -- registered voter . But he would not vote -- Yeah . -- before then . And , I mean , I think that 's bad . Sure it is . Absolutely . You know , here I was . And , and even , of course there 's a lot of years between the two of us , but even with that many years between ,
