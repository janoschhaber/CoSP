Okay , let 's see . I think , uh , I guess , if I call I 'm supposed to start . I think , uh , that 's the way everybody has done it so far . Okay . But , anyway I think that , um , we are paying a lot in taxes , but I think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms , and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money . Um , we 're probably one of the , the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have . The , you know , as far as the quality of the streets , the school systems , um , the hospital stuff that the government gives money to . Um , the , you know , all the things that the government does like that . I , uh , I think they need to manage it a little bit better , but I do n't think , uh , anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks , because they 've been messing it up for many years , now . So , 

I have to agree that . Yeah . And you 're right . We , I mean , we , you know , we do have a good government . We do have a lot of things that , you know , that , you know , the taxes are there to support , but I do think they 're mismanaged and I think that sometimes it 's too easy of a , I do n't know , to easy of an answer . It seems to say , I 'll tax them if you ca n't get enough money , instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or , or , you know , get all of the waste out of the spending . Huh-uh . Uh , I do n't know what y'all are paying in Dallas , but , you know , it seems like we pay the state , you know there 's a , the taxes set by , you know , the state and the city can add theirs , and the county adds theirs , and , you know , we 're paying almost eight percent sales tax , right now . Which seems to me nuts . I came from California and , you know , when I left there , we paid six cents on the dollar , and that was like one of the highest in the nation . Right . I think it 's seven here . Yeah . 

Seven point something . Yeah . Ourselves is seven point seven five . Huh-uh . Whole state . Yeah . It drives me crazy . I 'm thinking , you know , everybody is sitting here screaming about , we do n't want a state income tax , but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they do n't do anything about it . Right . You know . Where are you at ? What state ? I 'm in Lubbock , Texas . Oh , really . Yeah . Yeah . There 's , 

we 're still , we 're still one of few that do n't have the , uh , state tax MUMBLEx . That 's true . And I did pay state tax in California , but my goodness , that , that , the , what did you call it , the sales tax , is just getting outrageous to pay . Yeah . That 's true . You do n't sound like you 're from Dallas . Where do you , do you come from originally Texas ? Yeah . I do . 

I 've lived in , in the Dallas area here since I was like four . Oh , okay . So . Uh , it 's , I do n't know , an urban area , I guess whatever . I do n't know . 

You just , you just managed to escape the real Texan accent , Yeah . I thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there . No . No . I 've just lived here , Yeah . But , I do n't know , I do , I can think of all the biblical things about it , too . Where , what did they say to , uh , I ca n't think of the scripture . Render unto Caesar 's what is Caesar 's . 

That 's right . So , you know , even , even in the story where they had to pay the taxes , the disciples , Yeah . and , uh , Jesus said the money in the fish 's mouth or in the fisher , inside the fish . And , uh , I thought of those two things when I was , I was holding for a long time . Oh , were you really , Yeah . trying to find someone at home ? Yeah . Well , you know , um , back then what they tried to do , you know , the MUMBLEx would always try to stump Jesus , try to give him something that would contradict himself , Right . And so that 's what they were trying to do with the tax situation . And , of course , that 's when he said well you render unto Caesar 's what is Caesar 's , you render unto God what is God 's . Right . And , uh , you know , of course , there , I do n't think they really cared about the answer , Right . they just wanted to try and catch him in something . Yeah . But , but I believe in paying taxes and , I mean , yeah , like everybody else , I try to take as many deductions as I can , Oh , sure . 

MUMBLEx you know , I do n't want to pay more than I have to , Sure . And I get outraged when I feel like they go up for useless reasons , but I believe that they 're necessary . Right . So , I really do , Yeah are , Do you , do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or , No , not really . I 've , I spends a lot of time with our income tax , though . This , especially , this year and last year . Um , I have been married for just a few years , 

so I 've had to really switch around from the E Z form to the , uh , Schedule A . Right . Well , yeah . All the deductions and all that . Did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act , it seemed like it made everything harder ? Yeah . It really did . I , I saw , that , too . I did n't notice anything simplified about it , except that they took away the deductions , Right . the interest and , Right . other things . We 're looking at buying a house , Yeah . And that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house . 

And it will help tremendously . Yeah . We bought ours five years ago and it 's the one thing , it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year you 've paid all interest and no principles . Right . So that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back . Yeah . There 's a thing I just , 

I 've been trying to learn as much as I can about it , if you pay , I know I get paid twice a month , every two weeks , Huh-uh . that 's once a month . Huh-uh . Well , I get twenty six paychecks , That 's right . which would come out to be in thirteen months . So if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks , Huh-uh . Instead of once a month , you 'll come out paying a , uh , one month extra every year . That 's right . And it will , if have you a thirty year note , it will take like seven or plus years off of your note . That 's right . My parents , uh , bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago , And they did that . 

They thought their payment was automatically taken out like every other Wednesday , Oh , yeah . And that 's exactly right . Everyone , though the note is thirty years , she said it 's going be paid off in twenty or twenty one years , Right . or something like that . Yeah . Just because of exactly what you said , Right . You 're making one more month 's payment every year . 

And that 's going on the principle , it does n't pay any interest , Yeah . or , usually it does n't . That 's a good way to do it . Yeah . And when we bought this house , we looked at doing a fifteen year note , because it added more to the payment , Huh-uh . but not significant amounts , you know , it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner . Right . That 's what we 're looking at , fifteen or maybe twenty . Yeah . We 're not going to go longer than twenty . Yeah . But , we 're taking our time . We 're going to try to make our decision by July . 

Well , that 's good , though . Well , we just started two or three weeks ago . Yeah . And we 're not going to just kill ourselves just two or three houses a week at the most . Well , that 's good , though . Yeah . Is it kind of a buyer 's market down there ? Absolutely . Yeah . Well , that 's good . Credit union has nine percent interest . That 's pretty excellent . Yeah . 

So that 's , I do n't know , we could n't think of a better time to buy than now . That 's good . But , anyway . Well , um , I ca n't think of a whole lot more to say . Well , I ca n't either . I appreciate the call , though . Yeah . 

Me , too . I enjoyed talking to you . Yeah , same here . 

My wife , uh , she went to , uh , the school out there in Lubbock . In Lubbock ? She was there for two or three years before we got married . I guess , before I even met her . . Just a second . Okay . Go ahead . 

But anyway , So she was at school out here ? She went to school there . 

Well , what was her name ? Cathy Walker . No . I did n't know any Walkers . Yeah . Well , good luck in your house hunting . Yeah . Thanks a lot . You , y'all work at T I ? 

I do . You do . Yeah , I 'm in human resources . Oh , really . Yeah . That 's interesting . I work in the waiver . 

Do you really , because that 's , I work with Elma . Oh , really . Yeah . Yeah . And I used to work , I , I did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years . Oh , wow . And then I have been in Human Resources for the last two years and I work with those same people all those nine years , so , Yeah . I feel kind of part of the staff . Yeah . Yeah , 

I 'm , uh , turning in a capital request right now , You are . Yeah . That 's funny that 's where you 're from . What are trying to get ? 

A machine that puts back grind tape on and off the waivers . Oh . Okay . So you work in back grind ? Yeah . I 'm , I 'm sort of an acting process engineer . 

Oh , okay . Not officially , but that 's pretty much what I do . That 's what you do , uh , Yeah . And do you MUMBLEx ? Right and MUMBLEx . Well good deal . 

What did you think of Sam ? Uh , oh , I like him , he 's hard , but we needed that . Well , that 's good . Yeah 

he 's , He was very good for Lubbock when he came to , you know , it was the same kind of thing , he had a lot of good results . Yeah . That 's , that 's what he said here . Good . 

He 's gotten us into a linear flow that we 've never been in before . Well , good . That 's been a real big plus . Good . He 's broadened , our , um , the devices that we 're making , too , Oh , okay . which has made us as lot more stable . Well , that 's good . Anyway , well , it was nice to talk to you . Well , you too , and , They 're are going to interrupt us any minute now , I can tell . 

well , I know they will , and besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed . Okay , yeah , me , too . Well , have a good day . You , too . Bye . Bye-bye .
