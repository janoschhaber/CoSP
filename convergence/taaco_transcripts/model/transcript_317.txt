Do you have any hobbies ? Yes , I do . What are yours ? China painting and ceramics . Ooh , how great . I enjoy it . Uh-huh . Oh , uh , ceramic painting . I enjoy the china more . The china more . And now that I have my eyes , corrected to the point that I can see the delicate part of china painting , I do enjoy it . How did you ever get into that ? That sounds so interesting . My husband kept begging me , and he 's been dead now for twenty years , so you understand that this was a long time ago . But he finally brought me the china , the book , the brushes and he said I have made arrangements for your lessons . How marvel , I , And I said I 'll do it for three months and if I do n't like it , that 's it . Well , I painted an awful lot until his death , which was several years . And it has just been the most relaxing , enjoyable , self-satisfying thing I 've had . I , Now , do you do it just for yourself , or do you do it to give as gifts , or do you actually sell it ? I have sold quite a bit . I give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home , and then I just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it . Uh-huh . Oh , that sounds mar- , now , do you work outside of the home ? 

I have just retired . You 've just retired . Yes . Oh , oh , what a great -- No , it 's not , -- hobby . I , 

It 's a great hobby , but do n't retire . Do n't retire . Oh , Well , see , I do n't , 

I never , uh , returned to work for the p- , I have stayed home for about the last nine years . Oh , have , well , We 've transferred around , and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake , uh , on Lake Erie . So the lake life appealed to me , and my husband 's working and he left it up to me if I worked or not . Wow . So , in my spare time , I love to sew . There are n't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing , but I do make all my own clothes and we recently purchased a new home , so I enjoy doing my , uh , toppers for my window applications -- Oh , uh-huh . -- and things like that . But , uh , just when I thought I really enjoyed my hobby , yours sounds great . Well , my sister is the seamstress of the two of us . And , but she does n't china paint so we both have our expertise side . That is excellent . What part of Ohio are you in ? We 're in the sub- , I 'm in the suburb of Cleveland and I 'm about , uh , fifteen miles , probably , from downtown Cleveland , something like that . And Cleveland is located right on Lake Erie and prior to this , we were fifty miles west from here . So we were right on the lake . And Cleveland is n't all as bad as what you 've heard . Oh , what 's that , And you do find people , uh , into the crafts and the things that , uh , various things for spare time , but , I have never heard and I have actually never run into anyone into the china painting and I 'm just intrigued with it . 

If you ever start , be sure and start with a large piece that you can , I mean a large flat plate . Um , that way you can get the feel of , you 're not cramped on these smaller objects . Right , where you 're getting into the delicate work . That 's right . 

Now , do you , where did you first get your lessons from ? In Abilene , Texas . Through a , uh , an adult ed , or strictly a china type , She just taught china painting . Uh-huh , and , Oh , how marvelous . Then , then we had so much fun there , 

I had a friend from Albany , which is about thirty-six miles away , and we would meet every Thursday morning at our instructor 's home , because she did our firing for us , and she would help us and we bought lots of equipment from her , supplies and it was just such a delightful time . And then after I , Oh , and it 's so nice , Beg pardon ? 

It must be so nice for you , now that you 're retired . I have been a little bit negligent about it because I was so tired when I had to go to work after my husband 's death . So I have put it aside for a little while , but I 'm , I have just found me an instructor to get started again , uh-huh . Oh , is n't that great . And you 'll probably really , uh , re , regain your enthusiasm for it -- Uh-huh . -- once you get into a , a class again . Of course , I just have one beautiful p- , with peonies , uh , umbrella stand , 

and I have two daughters and they 're both ,
