Uh , the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a , uh , long term financial plan and monthly budget . The only thing I do now is , uh , put the data into Quicken . I do n't know if you are familiar with that . Yeah , I have some friends of mine who use Quicken 

and , uh , I 've considered using it once myself , but I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date . Uh-huh . So I , I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken , at least for now . Um . I 've found it 's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then , well , uh , uh , not bother to total it -- Uh-huh . -- and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic . So it really helps with that . Yeah , well , it 's similar problems but , uh , we just have the one check book 

and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible and occasionally we will get behind like you say but , uh , it does n't really seem to be too , too tight if we just remember to keep everything up , up to date and balanced . Uh-huh . Well , how to you handle that , the long range or medium range planning on finances ? Well , actually we have n't had to . Uh , until just recently . 

I guess we 've got a , a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way so -- Uh-huh . -- we needed to start doing more of that just for , uh , you know , saving for college and things like that . We tried a way , try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that . Yeah . Well that 's pretty good if you can do that . I know . 

I have a daughter who 's ten and we have n't really put much away for her college up to this point but , uh , we 're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away -- Uh-huh . -- for college , so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction -- Um . -- in the fall and then the money that I will be making this summer we 'll be putting away for the college fund . Um . Sounds good . Yeah , I guess we 're , we 're just at the point , uh , my wife worked until we had a family 

and then , you know , now we 're just going on the one income so it 's -- Uh-huh . -- a lot more interesting trying to , uh , find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to , uh , do it . You know , kind of enforce the savings . Uh-huh . But , uh , it will be interesting to see MUMBLEx . Well our situation is just a little bit , kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently , uh , took on a full time job , well almost full time . Um . So , it 's only recently that we 've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for , uh , long range goals like college and sickness and -- Um . 

-- travel and that kind of thing . That sounds good . But , uh , uh , I was just curious , what , uh , part of the country . Oh , Stockton . Oh , okay . 

How about you ? Uh , Cincinnati , actually . I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with , uh , the western accents or something like that . I do n't know how many people are , uh , getting involved in this but -- Uh-huh . -- uh , well that 's interesting . I 'm , uh , uh , actually , uh , I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by , uh , reading TELECOM DIGEST or was there another ? Uh , a colleague of mine at , uh , work got some information over , uh , the computer network called INTERNET . Oh , okay . Yeah , that is how I got it as well but , uh , And he just forwarded that on to me 

and , uh , it sounded like it would be an interesting project -- Uh-huh . -- to participate in so I -- Yeah , it will be interesting to see what , -- sent back MUMBLEx mail . It would be interesting to see how the data base , MUMBLEx so , well , I guess we 're talking about the experiment . Uh-huh . Uh , probably need to try to get back on the topic but , uh , it 's hard to talk about finances without without getting to , uh , dollar figures I guess -- Uh-huh . -- you know , we could talk about some of the long range goals and , Well what other long range goals do you have besides college ? Uh , well I think , either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that . It seems like every year my employer just gives back , you know , a little bit your tuition reimbursement . Uh-huh . I mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent and now it 's , uh , now it 's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class and , uh , it 's a real shame from what we had before , uh , because we 're ,
