Okay , Bill , right ? Yes . Okay , Bill , have you done much camping ? Uh , yes . 

I 'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts . Uh-huh . And I camp , uh , every month , uh , camp at least one weekend and during the summer we camp , uh , two or three weeks a year . 

Oh , well , that , that sounds good . I 'd say I camp quite a bit . Yeah , you do . Um , now do you have a lot mountains , well , you do n't have mountains in Texas , do you . Where do you find places to camp ? Well , uh , we , we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping -- Oh . 

-- and we , uh , we also , uh , carry all our equipment with us -- Uh-huh . -- and so we canoe down the river and then , sleep on the river on one of the , um , sand bars and then -- Oh . -- get up the next morning , cook our breakfast , and go down the river again . Oh , my word . Well that sounds adventuresome . How about yourself ? 

Well , um , I 've done , oh , I would say quite a bit of camping , mostly with my husband and I . Um , we have five children , and so we have found that camping with the little ones is n't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves . So we 've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out , and we have gone up into the mountains and , uh , not necessarily roughed it , but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains . Well , that 's good . And , then the boys are , our boys are old enough now , they 're twelve and eleven , and so , they 're involved in the scouting and they do a lot of camping with the scouts -- Uh-huh . -- and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week , and so this year they 'll both be going , and so that 's been real enjoyable for them . Great . So . What , uh , what kind of camping do they like best ? Do they like it where they have tents and , uh , do they cook on stoves ? 

Um , yes , they 've , well , no , actually they 've , I remember , they have taken the , the du- , the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire , and I do n't think they 've taken the stoves . Um , last year they camped in tents , and this year I believe they will be in tents also . Uh-huh . Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah . Uh-huh , yeah . It does n't get very cold in Texas , 

so lots of times we do n't even take tents . Oh , is that right ? We just use trail tarps . Oh , and what does that consist of ? 

Uh , it 's just a piece of material that has , uh , that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it -- Oh . -- and make it into a tent -- Uh-huh . -- uh , like a , uh , they 're very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking . So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles , then , uh , they 're not very heavy , see -- Uh-huh . -- so you carry them with you , and -- Oh . -- they 'll keep you dry or whatever . Yes , well , see , when , when we go camping here , we have to take our big huge , heavy sleeping bags , and lots of tents and , I like to sleep on the air matresses . I 'm not , my bones are getting so old , so I like to , I like to sleep on the matresses . Uh-huh . Um , so , have you had any adventures on your camping trips , with , encounters with wild animals or anything like that ? Ye- , yes , in fact , uh , um , last month we went camping , we saw a lot of deer -- Oh . -- uh , in the morning and the afternoon -- My word . -- just deer everywhere . Gee . Uh-huh , 

so , uh , but , it , even though , uh , it was n't hunting season , and we were with Boy Scouts , so -- Uh-huh . -- of course we do n't , uh , want to go hunting . But we got to see a lot of deer -- Oh . -- um , out and about and there 's , of course , we see smaller animals all the time , and , uh , one thing that is a big concern in the evening , at night , uh , is , uh , make sure that all the food 's put away and so forth -- Oh . -- because , uh , we have , uh , armadillos . Do you know what -- Oh . -- armadillo is ? Uh , they 're covered like with a heavy armor -- Uh-huh . -- type stuff , uh-huh . 

And possums , and , uh , raccoons . My word . And we have those creatures down here that they like to , uh , they like to go hunting for a midnight snack . Uh-huh . And so that , that , uh , that can be a problem if you do n't put all your equipment away . But they wo n't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything . They will if you attack them . Oh . But most time they run away from you -- Uh-huh . -- if they , if they see you 're up , you know -- Uh-huh . -- but they do n't have any problem walking right by you if you 're asleep . Oh , my word . So . Well , that sounds a little less fierce than bears . We , we want to ,
