Well , what are your , did you like , do you use credit cards ? Uh , not very often . I usually , uh , 

the ones we use is like Visa and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month . Huh-uh . I have , uh , uh , . 

So it does n't get , uh , uh , the credit , uh , Right . the interest rate is so high that you 're really , if you 're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy , I think , do n't you ? . Yeah . Otherwise , you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it 's hardly , That 's right . uh , it 's not a very good idea . Do you have a lot of credit cards ? Well , I have a lot of them but I do n't use them very much , though . Right . I use them mostly for big things , like maybe , sometimes , uh , tuition if it 's , you know , if I 'm short , to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as I can . The other thing , I , I think if you do get overextended a little bit , you need to be sure and pay it off , uh , more than one at a time , because I think you could run forever paying what they require . Oh , yeah . Just goes on and on . 

Which is what they want . Yeah . I think a lot of people go in debt because they think , oh , you know , I can just charge it , but really , I mean , if they do n't have the money then , they are n't going to have it in a month , so , Yeah , that 's true . they , uh , make the mistake of , 

There are times , pushing all their cards . when it 's , when it 's very useful , Yeah . like , uh , emergency trip , Yeah . 

or something . Sometimes when you , when you , the money will be available , but it 's , you know , not immediately handy . I think , uh , they 're very helpful , plus the fact that it 's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes . Right . But , uh , I , you really do need to be very , um , oh , responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble . Yeah . 

I made that mistake when I first got a job and that 's kind of like , it took me quite a while to pay them off , Uh-huh . so af- , after that I decided , well , I 'm not going to use them at all , and just try to pay cash for everything and that worked for a while and then we got married so we decided to , you know , if we used them we would pay them off as we go . Right . So , Right . 

That can be very handy under those kind of circumstances . The other thing about them is too , if you really do n't , you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed , and have n't developed a credit thing . It stops you from doing a lot of things . If you , Right . if you pay for everything by cash , uh , there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or , That 's true , yeah . a car . So , so they , they have become a very vital part of our , of our monetary system , Uh-huh . over the last few years . 

But , uh , it 's true , you have to be very careful or you end up , uh , going in the deep end and , uh , and an awful lot of people are in trouble . Uh-huh . We have a boy living with us who works for a credit card , uh , company that , and he makes calls to people who have problems , you know , credit problems , Huh-uh . that are trying to work out and , uh , . Poor thing he comes home very depressed every night , Oh . because the world has so many problems of that sort , so it 's , Yeah . it 's , uh , it 's , uh , it 's a really big problem I think , and , um , takes mature people to , to treat it , uh , so that it 's , so that it 's a real advantage to you , instead of a disadvantage . Right . I think , um , the way the tax system was , they encouraged people to use credit cards , you know , with a big write off at the end of the year . Yeah . But now , it 's like , it 's punch money , because -- Right . It did n't do you any good now , does it ? -- you can not , right . You can not write off your interest . 

Even before it probably was n't , though , because you did n't get anywhere near as much as what it , Yeah . you did n't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying . So , well , I 'm not , other than that , I do n't have too much on credit cards but ,  It 's good to talk to you . Yeah . You , too . Thanks for calling . Uh-huh , bye now . Bye .
