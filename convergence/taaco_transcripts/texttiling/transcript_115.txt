Okay . Well , do you exercise regularly ? There is , well , I am a school teacher . Uh-huh . And , us , there is , uh , uh , girl that went through our school district , I teach in Highland Park -- Uh-huh . -- who , uh , does aerobics at the Y C A -- Uh-huh . -- and I say Y , the Y W C A turn that off please , I am recording . 

My husband just turned on something noisy . Uh-huh . Any way , uh , she comes to the school and there are a group of teachers , and we exercise -- Uh-huh . -- regularly and , uh , for an hour and we do it twice a week . Oh . That is good . And , uh , we do , uh , aerobics , for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes and then we do stretching -- Uh-huh . -- and toning and cool down -- Uh . -- for another thirty minutes . So it is an hour . 

And then my husband and I take , uh , ten mile walks , uh , as often as possible . Uh-huh . And , uh , not on the nights that I do aerobics , but if , if he wants to , he jogs , but I , uh , I , we take the fast walks and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house . Uh-huh . And so , we , we , take it seriously . We enjoy doing it . MUMBLEx . I enjoy my group at school . It is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody -- Yeah . -- than is is to do it by yourself . Uh-huh . Uh , well I use to exercise regularly and I have n't lately . Oh , oh . I have goofed off , I guess . 

Uh , I use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work . Uh-huh . But , uh , I guess my job change , my husband 's job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more . Oh I understand that . So , uh , I have never been able to do it before . Well , the problem is that I am so tired at the end of the day , I just want to go home and not do anything . Well , I and too . I just make myself . Yeah . I get up at five thirty and I am at school at seven thirty . Oh . School is not over until , uh , four -- Uh-huh . -- and our class , 

but it is in the building -- Oh . -- that is the big difference because there are other people around that , uh , you had better hurry . Go get dressed . You know , there is motivation around there and then , uh , we , we can change right there in the building . 

I do n't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere . Uh-huh . And I just go and we , uh , exercise . And until then , you know I have belonged to exercise clubs and oh I have gone to , uh , oh , like , uh , oh , these gyms , you know that the , like in Plano and Richardson and , uh , where they offer the , uh , rec centers really -- Uh-huh . -- where they offer aerobics and I have done that before , but it has always had to be late at night -- Yeah . -- after I have got home and after dinner and you are just kind of going Ugh . And I have tried it immediately after school like , try to get some place and exercise from five to six , but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late . That is right . That is right . That is a MUMBLEx . It is . It is really hard with our life style when you work to , Uh-huh . Well , I know , some people go during lunch , but , you know by the time I get over the gym and , and go for my class and shower and get back to work , it is probably two hours or more -- Uh-huh . -- and that is just too long . I have twenty-five minutes for lunch . Yeah . That is out for me . That does n't really do it , does it ? No , I do n't think so . Yeah . But , uh , and they are nice because if we are running late , it usually , uh , if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late , they kind of wait on us . You know , cause they know we are in the building and coming . Yeah . Where as , at , uh , another place , you are paying a lot more money and , uh , it does going to start whether you are there or not . That is right . That is right . So this has worked out real nicely . In fact , she charges us two dollars a session . Well , that is not much . Huh-uh . So it 's , it 's , we like pay her for six weeks at a time -- Uh-huh . -- cause that is like a unit in , uh , uh , school -- Uh-huh . -- uh , report card period and so it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks . Oh . That is not bad . Huh-uh . It beats memberships at some of these clubs . That is for sure . You are not kidding . They are real expensive . I know . We belonged , uh , for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year . Uh-huh . I mean , we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership -- Oh . -- and at first we used it and then it got where we were n't beginning to get out money 's worth . Yeah . And they offered lots of things , but we were n't taking advantage of them because we did n't have the time to . Yeah . So we decided to forget that . Uh-huh . That was just a waste of our our money . Yeah . Yeah . Well we have one through work Oh no . But , I , uh , I do n't know I still just do n't do n't end up going cause it is n't at a convenient time or I do n't know something , but I need to do something . If , if it 's only walk the dog or something . Uh-huh . I need to start doing that . It does make you feel better . The hard thing is getting going . That is right . And if you have somebody who will do it with you , like , for a long time my husband did n't want to walk cause he wants to , uh , jog -- Uh-huh . -- but he decided that , uh , maybe , uh , you know ,
