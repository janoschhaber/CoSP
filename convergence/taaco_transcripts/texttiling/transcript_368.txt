Okay , well , do you have a pet ? I have two cats . Two cats , you 're lucky . And do , and , oh , and two fish . Your two fish . And what do you have ? Well , my husband , you know , how , sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing . Oh , no . My husband is a hunter , fisherman , outdoorsman , Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog . 

So we have a black Labrador . Ooh . Beautiful , gorgeous black Labrador , but to me , he belongs up in the field , you know , in the -- -- ranch , in the farm and , Well , because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind , uh , he sleeps in the laundry room and then he goes out for the day . But this , this is a beautiful dog and he is wonderful with our little girls and he is , he 's , comes from a purebred line 

and there 's nothing you could say bad about him , except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person -- Right . -- that you could sit in the chair and cuddle . Right . And this is huge . You know , course , when he runs around the yard , he just digs , he does n't know that he 's tearing up things , 

but he does . Yeah , yeah . And the worst part that I had with him , he 's , he 's three now -- Uh-huh . -- was when he was , uh , about eight months old and I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one , and I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour . And I came home and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall . Oh , my word . And it was in the floor and I just about lost it and I called and I said , come home and get your dog . 

And so , he said , well , puppies just chew when they 're nervous and I , well , I wish you had told me -- Oh , dear . -- you know , and it was about eight months later , he ate a piece of the linoleum . He kept picking at it and I did n't kn , the , the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it . So the last thing he did was , when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard , and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch . And I told my husband , I said , you know , it 's either me or the dog , and he looked at me like , well , you know Good-bye . He loves this dog and every night when he comes home from work , he hugs it and talks to him and he 's a good dog , so it 's one of those things I 'm just having to get used to and that 's why I laughed when they called with the topic . I thought , oh , boy , do I have a pet . But , I , I grew up with cats and I 'm very comfortable , I love my cats . Yeah . I had one cat for eighteen years . I got her when I lived in Hawaii . Oh . Before I even got married I had my cat . She 's old . Well , she , I -- Is n't she ? -- had to have her put to sleep last -- Oh , I started to say -- -- June . -- then you broke your heart . Oh , it was awful , it was just awful . Oh . But , and she just sat there on my lap , you know . Oh . She just , just waited and , Bless your heart . Oh , it was awful . That makes me feel so bad . But her hair , but the bad thing was , though , she would pee in my husband 's shoes . Yeah . Oh , no . You know , and she just liked his shoes and he 'd have these dress sh- , -- Oh . -- hundred dollar shoes . Oh , no . Oh , it was just bad . And my closet and it was , oh , something . Oh , that 's awful , I never heard of that before . Oh , it was terrible . And once she did it , you know , then she would , I mean , she would n't , if our shoes sat side by side , she would pee in my husband 's shoes . Uh-huh . She must have known he did n't like her or something . Or the smell or something . Oh , anyway , I , I , and I would shut , I would bar the closet doors , and would car- , vac- , uh , clean the carpets and -- Uh-huh . -- oh , dear , it was just awful . Well , d , now , does -- That was very funny . -- your cat sleep in the house ? They are , they are house cats . I , uh , well , I have two cats right now . Yeah . And , of course . Oh , yeah , good . They sleep with my kids . My kids , my , my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed -- Oh . -- just for the cat . But the cat does n't destruct does it ? See , it does n't do anything . Oh , no , I -- See . -- I 'm not going to have a dog . We 've had two dogs and , uh , they both got ran over . Oh , no . After we had them for several years , just nice little outside dogs but -- Yeah . -- were just my kids ' friends , they would go jog , they would go with me when I would go running and -- Oh . -- and the last one got hit , uh , as she was following my , one of my sons across the road to the school . Oh , no . It was awful . It was just , Oh , that is . And it just , it 's too heartbreaking but they do dig up and they just , they just wreck things and I 'm not a -- They do wreck things . -- dog person . Well , I 'm not either . Ooh . I 'm not either and it 's just been , I would n't want a Lab . It sounds beautiful , but , He 's beautiful but it 's just one of those concessions , I just had to make , but I kind of ignore him . Now today 's the first cold we 've had in Texas and it 's really cold and drizzly and it 's freezing -- Um . -- and people are doing their fires and I brought him in because he 's just a wet mess out there and he 's in the laundry room with this little carpet square and he 's just huddled up like , if you 'll be nice to me , I wo n't make any trouble , you know . And then my daughters both have hamsters . Oh . And I , I , And how old are your girls ? . They 're eleven and eight and I -- Oh , yeah . -- gave in at Christmas and they have , they keep their cages real clean . It always smells of cedar and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and , Sure . I think they 're cutting us off . No , that 's -- Oh . -- somebody 's trying to cut in on my line and I do n't want to answer . Oh , okay . I 'll just wait . Okay . No , I 've , I 've got incoming calls and I do n't know why , -body 's calling . Oh , okay . I , I hate to cut it off , I think -- I understand . -- they would cut us off , so we 'll just wait . Okay , well -- Whoever it is will call back . -- they 'll cut us off pretty soon . Well , it 's somebody calling for my kids , you know , jeez . Yeah , I know . Actually , it 's my son , I know it is . My older boy . He never likes to come home from school . Anyway that 's what we have , and I have , I 've tried to start a fish tank -- How does , -- and I keep -- In the salt water ? -- losing all my fish . Salt water or , No -- Yeah . -- just regular water .
