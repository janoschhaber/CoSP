I have , uh , I , well , I used to have the opinion that there wa , that there really was not any more crime in America , in the cities , anyway , than there was in previous centuries , uh , before , uh , simply because . The reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced , uh , reporting methods , with computers and other devices . Compile more statistics . That 's right , 

and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets . Uh-huh . However , I have been persuaded , lately , I guess , simply by the , uh , overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime . More especially where you are . Are you , Well , yeah . 

in Washington D C or Washington state ? No , I am in , I am in Washington D C . Yeah , yeah , I was going to say , Actually it , you know , I do a lot of business here , and I come here quite often and , and that again is a , is a sort of media perception there 's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington . Oh , yeah . Regardless of the racial makeup , but it 's , it 's real , uh , 

there 's pockets of violence that is so violent that they , uh , It just really grabs your attention . Yeah . It just makes the whole place seem like that . Right . Now just to focus on that a minute , I guess , uh , uh , 

when , uh , previous secretary of , uh , educa- , Bennett , I think his name was , Yeah . became the drug czar , uh , for , uh , President Bush , he was going to focus on it , on this area and do something about it and I see that even he was met without , with , with little success , even though the entire , I guess a , a quite a bit of money and other , uh , planning efforts went into that . What do you , what do you think is causing all this , Well , because , it seems that there even though 

crime , though I think it is increasing in number , it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity , Yes . and violence too . Well , I , I have three theories about it , you know , three things . I have one theory , and it 's brought to us by two things . One I , I believe that this is a function of , uh , the violence that young people see on television and the movies . Uh-huh . And , I am not just talking about , you know , uh , role models of gu- , of tough guys and gangsters and things like that , 

I am not even , I am not even convinced that maybe things like football , hockey and , th- , th- , the , you know , the , and even baseball games now where the , everything is settled with a fight . You know , the , the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle th- , the argument . And , and then I , I am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree , so I think that particularly I , I was reading the other day about , uh , Corpus Christi , Texas which has the MUMBLEx the highest , I think it 's Corpus Christi , that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America -- -- uh , per capita . Yeah , I was , I have not seen that , but , uh , I mean the Saturday night special stuff so , Yeah . That , that 's what I think about it , that 's some of the things I think about it , plus I do not know , 

what are your views ? Well , yeah , I tend to agree with you with , you know , it seems anymore , uh , a movie can not be considered good unless there 's just some , some sort of violence , Yes . or something in it . And , and along with that , you know , and then you start making a movie and it has no , there 's no call for something violent , 

but , so they just throw something in there just to say they have it . Exac- , well that 's , that 's , that 's the impression I get , you know . Yeah . And I , and I imagine that it 's , MUMBLEx you know , it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society , people want to , it conditions people to it and , uh , you have to amp , it has to be even , uh , magnified to to attract people 's attention . I guess , Yeah , you become callous . to have them spend money on something like that . Yeah . And I am sure that it does form role models for young , for young men and young women 

and , Yeah . uh , I mean I , I , read now where we are , you know , women are arr , young women are arrested fighting with knives over , over whatever . Um . MUMBLEx whatever reason , which is kind of unheard of when I was young . Now , I do not want to sound like an old fart , but , that 's what 

seems that those things happened befor- , did not happen in that manner before television . And I , I , I , I have to think that , that it has some influence on it . But , I listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time -- Yeah . I do not know if you listen to him or not , No . he 's on A M , but , ther- , there 's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the , there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for Los Angeles , the guy under Gates , Oh , yes . and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was , just some of the things that he believed in , some of his morals . For instance , uh , they asked him if he spanked his kids , and he said `` You bet , I believe in discipline '' . 

And people , I , I , I , I guess they confus , confused discipline with punishment . Yeah . You know . Yeah . And , just , it seems anymore that , uh , if , if you have , you know , this type of a moral stance , that people come down on you . It 's like , you know , hey , everybody has to be free to do their own thing . And I disagree , and I think that 's really contributing to this high rate of crime . Yes , yes . Well , I mean , I , I guess what I wanted to say and I stopped , uh , I do not know , I got diverted , was that , that , uh , there 's so mu , there 's so much of a return from pris- , to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure . And , and that is not emphasized . I recognize there 's , there 's over crowding problems 

and , and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now , that that 's complicated the entire process . Yeah . What I also think that , I guess it 's the reflection of the society where , where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to , uh , you know , it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you , where you live or . I do not mean respons- , attachment and responsibility , I guess I mean any sort of , Well , nobody feels responsibility to do something . It 's like , oh boy , I wish they would stop doing that . Yes , that 's right . Yeah . Yeah I , I do not know how that 's , I do not think it 's done by , uh , the changes come simply by statutory nature . I do not know what it really will take . Um . And , I do not know if I have solutions , except , except to , you know , I am sort of a , a , an advocate of , of , uh , of letting people , of having free speech and I guess to curb , uh , television , uh , the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that . Yeah . However , there does seem to be a , right now in verbalizing , it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort . Yeah , and then how many , And the sacrifice is not that great . How many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between , Yeah . you know , what you see and how yo- , I mean , what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do . Yes , yes , I think , I think that 's correct . And , yes but , you know , as soon as you start , uh , Well , Texas has , uh , Texas has , uh , has always struck me , I mean I , I , I have lived in and out of Texas , both in the service and , uh , uh , short business stints . And it seems to me they are a pretty , pretty tough law and order state , but that 's a , but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state . Just citing that , you know . Yeah , uh , unfortunately you have got a lot of the , uh , some , well a lot of it can be contributed to th- , the racial differences , I mean , just that we are so close , Yeah . to the border with Mexico , we have got a lot of that influence . 

Yeah .
