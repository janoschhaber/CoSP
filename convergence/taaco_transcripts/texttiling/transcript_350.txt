So do you have an opinion on credit cards ? Um , I do . You do ? What , what do you think about them ? I think they get a lot of people in trouble . Yeah , definitely . I have one right now and , um , I just got it about eight , six months ago -- Uh-huh . 

-- and I find that it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally would n't get . Yeah , and then you do n't stop to realize that , you know , you charge this for twenty , charge that for twenty , charge this for twenty , and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars and you do n't stop to think about it . Yeah . I got in trouble when I was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble . Oh , my goodness . And then , you know , so I eventually got it all paid . Now I carry one . I have a gas card and a Visa card . And I never use them unless I need to . Really ? So -- That 's good . -- but they , D- , yeah , I , I made a rule with myself when I got one that if I could n't pay it in full every month that I 'd have to rip it up , 

so . Yeah . That 's , and interest rates are n't none too shallow these days anyway . Yeah , but , But I know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially , you know we have , I 'm in Lubbock and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech , and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot . Uh-huh . I have , I have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out . And they -- Yeah . -- they ca n't do anything but work to try to pay them off . And , and , and like one of my friends she has , hers is up to nine hundred dollars and she do , she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she 's going to school . Gee . And , and so I mean that 's just enough to pay rent and buy like thirty-five dollars worth of food a month . So and , and pay for her like , like monthly fee like twen- , yo- , I guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the -- Yes , something like that . -- so all she 's paying is interest on hers every month . Yeah . It just seems crazy to , to me but , Well , my wife got in trouble one time with hers . She was making like , I do n't know what she was making , forty-five dollars a month I think . And fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month . Yeah . So and that was before we got married , so . But it 's , you know , we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and it 's , it 's come out pretty good . Now we have a eighteen year old that 's fixing to get out of high school and go to college . Oh , really ? That 's the first thing he wanted . Was a Visa card ? Yeah . Oh , my goodness . So we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick . I bet . You know , so . Yeah , I , I do n't know . I 'm about sick of mine right now . I do n't , But I think they 're too readily accessible -- Uh-huh . -- and there 's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you dra , get you trapped . I mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it , but that 's a lot of pain and hassle . When , you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and we could n't afford everything , we did n't have such things as credit cards . We just waited until time come around that we could afford it . Right . And you know , we had all the necessities , so . And I very seldom use a credit card on necessities . I always use it for something I want not something I need . Exactly . So , Yeah , my parents are really good about not using credit cards . They are against it . Yeah . I do n't think they like the fact that I have one either . I think if card cards were as , as stringent as say a , a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to , you know , be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills , we probably would n't have the problems we have . Uh-huh . Of course , we would n't have the retail market we have either so I guess they trade one for the other . Yeah . I disagree with it , but they still trade one for the other . Huh . Well , that 's good . I 'm , it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for , you sound pretty young , so . Yeah , I 'm nine- , I 'm twenty right now . Are you ? Yeah . So , just going to school and , and working so -- All right . -- it does kind of get in the , when you want something that , like last weekend was homecoming and I needed -- Oh . -- a pair of shoes so I just went out and bought them and -- Yeah . -- on my credit card . I did n't really have the money to do it but , Yeah , it 's pretty easy . Yeah . It sure is . So do you just have two kids or , Uh , we have a eighteen year old , seventeen year old , and a seven year old . Oh , really ? Yeah . Neat . I 'm from Plano , Texas . Oh , are you ? But right now I 'm out in Provo , Utah going to B Y U so . Are you a , you 're a Mormon then ? Yep . Oh , all right . But , this is a extra long one . What 's that ? They 're giving us a lot of time . Oh , yeah . They may not , they must not have too much traffic on Saturdays . Yeah . Have you done a lot of this ? Uh , fifteen or twenty I guess . Oh , really ? Oh , yeah . Do you do it every day ? I try to every day . I , uh , I get calls at work , I get calls at home , so . Wha ,
