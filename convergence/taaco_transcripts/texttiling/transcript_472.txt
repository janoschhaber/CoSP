Well , what kind of vacations do you like to take ? MUMBLEx . Well , we 've , uh , we 've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to Europe so . Uh-huh . So , I , I guess those are the types I like . Uh-huh . We 've really enjoyed them . Yeah . Where have you gone there ? We 've gone to , um , Germany , Switzerland , Austria , Ireland and England . Uh-huh . We 've been to Germany twice . Uh-huh . But , um , I guess my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland . Uh-huh . Yeah well , I 've been over there too . Uh-huh . Where have you been ? I even . Let 's see , um , mostly Germany and France . Uh-huh . I lived in France for a year and a half so -- Oh , how neat . -- I was able , 

but , I , once when I had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of travelling around France I went to Germany -- Uh-huh . -- because , uh , I 've got relatives there and I just -- Oh , that 's neat . -- like it there . Uh-huh . So , but , um , Austria , I found really pretty -- Uh-huh . -- and Switzerland , yeah , and I , I lived in the Alps in France 

so I -- Oh , how neat . -- anything in the mountains over there I just love . Oh , yeah . Then I finally made it to England , too , uh , on my way home , um , I lived in Africa , actually , and on my way home from there . You lived in Africa ? Yeah . Oh , my goodness . Yeah . Wow . So , um , and you always have to go out , fly through , or unless you fly from Nairobi , you have to fly through , um , uh , Europe on your way home . Uh-huh . So , I went to England , and I really liked it there too . 

It 's so expensive over there . I know , it 's true . That 's the one thing . It really is . It just , it 's , it 's , I love to go over there , but it 's so darn expensive -- Yeah . -- to go over . Yeah , actually now you can get some really good deals flying over , but it 's -- Yeah . -- once you 're there you still have to spend money . Oh , I know , just . Unless you know people , you know . Right . Then you can stay with them , and -- Uh-huh . -- yeah . That helps a lot . Yeah . But . You know there 's a lot of places in the states that we have n't even gone . Uh-huh . You know , I 'd like to go to Hawaii some time , and -- Yeah . -- and , uh , we made it , we 've , we 've at least gone to the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls . So . Uh-huh . Yeah . Feel like we 've accomplished a little bit here . I have n't . I 've been , I 've , most of my vacationing in the U S has been on the West Coast -- Uh-huh . -- or this summer I went to Colorado -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , I 'd love to go to the East Coast , during the Fall . The , oh , the it 's , oh , I 've always wanted to go there . I 've seen pictures , and , and -- Yeah . -- it looks gorgeous . We , um , we made a trip up the East Coast . It was , uh , in the summer -- Uh-huh . -- and it really is pretty . Uh-huh . It 's , uh , both coasts are really pretty -- Yeah . -- but , um , I love the Carolinas . It 's just gorgeous over there . Uh-huh . I have n't been there , anywhere on the East Coast . Yeah . I think Tennessee has been the furthest east I 've been . Uh-huh . Yeah . Well , you 'll just have to plan a vacation some time -- Yeah , I guess so . -- and , and go over there . Yeah , but there 's , you know , there 's a lot to see here -- Uh-huh . -- but I just love going over to Europe because it 's so , their way of life is just so different than ours . Yeah . You know , we 're so fast paced here , and over there , you know , every time we 'd go and , and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we 'd always have to ask for the check -- Uh-huh . -- you know -- Yeah . -- they 're so leisurely over there -- Yeah . -- and it 's kind of nice to , to have that . Yeah . So the type of vacation you 'd like , um , like , would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place , or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week ? Well , usually a bunch of different places . Yeah , main- , mainly probably because you want to see everything . Right , see as much as -- Yeah . -- you can while you 're there . Yeah , I know . Yeah . Yeah . How did you like Africa ? Well , I liked it . I was working in Cameroon , Africa -- Uh-huh . -- and it 's not a , it 's not a place for tourists , I mean , they 're not used to having tourists there , so -- Uh-huh . -- it 's , you 're kind of roughing it . But , um , I liked it , I liked it . Uh-huh . The people there are just very , very friendly and . What type of work ? Um , I was working with an organization that does Bible translation . Oh , okay . So I was doing linguistic work actually , travelling around , finding out about languages , and -- Oh , uh-huh . -- uh , what they call survey work . Uh-huh . Find out where the languages are . Uh-huh . So , I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people . Yeah . Um . That 's neat . Yeah , I enjoyed it . So . I 've , I 've always , um , I 've talked to people who have been to Africa , and they , and then of course when that movie OUT OF AFRICA came out . Yeah . Um , but I 've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there . Yeah , my cousin came over while I was there , and she came to Cameroon and then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around -- Uh-huh . -- you know , close to Nairobi in Kenya . Oh how neat . So , she 'd always dreamed of doing that too . Yeah , that 's great . So . Yeah . So is there any place you would try to talk me into going to ? Uh . It sounds like we 've been to some of the same places . Yeah , it does .
