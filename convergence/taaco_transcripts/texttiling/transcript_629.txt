See , wh- , when you 're with a big company or a big organization , a lot of times , uh , you know , the benefits are good and , and , you know , the pay is regular but , uh , you know , sometimes you do n't get tuned in to what 's going on . And I , I think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that , that , uh , that anybody could get in , in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you , you get to know what 's going on . And maybe that 's , that 's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to , to do . What 's , what 's your feeling about benefits ? 

What sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company . Well , since I 'm kind of on the , the older side , you know , I , I , I just feel like , uh , when I start talking about benefits , I talk about , I 'm concerned about medical benefits . Uh , my , uh , my husband works for McDonald Douglas and so his benefits , his medical benefits are so excellent , you know , 

that 's really great . Uh-huh . You know , I work for , uh , Wes- , a bank , Western Financial . Uh-huh . And , uh , they do n't let me know really about anything that 's going on . Even some of the immediate things that I need to know , I do n't know it until the next hour and all of a sudden we know we 've got changes made . We 're changing departments . We 're changing policies . We 're changing doing other kinds of things . Which to me is , is disturbing . I mean , I feel like if , I , I do n't necessarily need to , uh , be involved since I 'm pretty much on a low level , you are , you are right there . You know , I 'm pretty much on a low level as far as , uh , the company is concerned . But I , I do kind of like to know what 's going on and what 's happening 

and I think I can be a better and more effective employee if , if I -- Well , th- , I -- -- had a little bit more information along that line . -- I well I work for the government and , uh , actually I work for the F B I . Oh , my gosh . And , uh , and so , you know , we , we do n't , there 's lots of things that we do n't get told . For good reason . But , uh , but basically , uh , there 's lots of things that , that we should know about projects . 

I 'm an engineer . You know . Uh-huh . I 'm , I 'm a COTR . And sometim- , and I , I worked in the same lab with a guy and we did n't really know that much about each other 's projects for two years . And we should have , 

you know , we 're , we 're now collaborating . Oh . And MUMBLEx -- And it , it , -- for two years we did n't . And , we , which was a , kind of stupid . But , uh , but our organization is doing something else t- , on Monday . Uh , we 're having a , for all unclassified programs , we 're , we 're having little tables put up in front of MUMBLEx lab in the hallways 

and every , all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do . Which I thought was kind of interesting and , Yeah , that is interesting . But , uh , but that , that sort , sort of thing . But , if you , I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what 's going on . Exactly . And , and , but of course most time , most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know . And , you know , if you do n't really count . If you 're not part of the program you might not get told for months . Or you might , you know , if it does n't impact you directly . Or if your management does n't think that . But , but regard to benefits . You know , most companies have , most big organizations have decent , you know , benefits like retirement and that sort of thing . In the private sector I would think that one of the major , uh , situations , especially when you reach , you know , the , the mid-fifties , wa , is keeping a job until you retire . A- , right . And engineers are , uh , are baggage to most , uh , uh , as they get older , to , to most companies . And , uh , it 's very much like the military , it windows out . You know , you , you think well , boy , I 'm getting more money and I 'm getting more responsibility , I 'm doing this . But as you climb up that tree , pretty soon you 're , the , the branches get smaller on the top of the tree -- Uh-huh . -- and pretty soon somebody falls off . I , I 've fallen off twice in the private sector . Oh . And , uh , and , you know , I can get up , I know . It , it seems to be , be kind of , kind of scary , you know . Because you think of , uh , see my son 's eighteen right now and he , he 's , uh , he wants to go into engineering . And the , the , the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open and he 's interested in , basically , three different areas . But , uh , it 's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that . He needs to do his own course of investigation and , and see what he can do because who knows what 's going to happen in another thirty years . Uh-huh . Yeah . And in thirty years it becomes pretty critical . I mean , my , uh , brother-in-law is like , uh , I mean he 's sixty . He 's not ready to retire but his company is , is , uh , is , uh , closing up . Uh-huh . And because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff . And all the nuclear and stuff which is what he , what he was working on . He 's getting cut back and he 's not ready to retire . Yeah , he may be retired .
