You said you have four cats ? Yes , I have four cats . How old are they ? Well they range from , let 's see about a year and a half to nine years old . Oh gosh . Yes . I have n't had my oldest one quite nine years , I 've had him probably five years . Oh okay , you get so attached to them . Oh yes , I love my cats . I lost one , one time , uh , Oh . the first one I got . 

He jumped off the balcony actually , of a second story apartment . Oh no . And he 'd never been outside , like , you know , by himself outside . Uh-huh . And it started raining and I was hysterical . I was , I was , I mean , you would have thought a child had died . Yes , uh-huh . I called everyone I knew , 

I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat . Yes , I understand . And they laughed at me , they thought that was so hysterical . Oh no , I understand , we , uh , we 've gone through the same things with ours , we 've had , you know , they 've been ill , I mean I take off work , Oh yeah . to take care of my cats , you know , my boss thinks I 'm absolutely crazy . And then we had a baby and it 's like , all right who comes first the cat or the baby . The cat was here first so . I know , it 's hard . And , and then when we go to sleep at night , you know , it 's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us . Oh , how funny . It 's like all right , whose corners is this one . That 's sweet , I have the two , the other two cats I have are outdoor cats . Oh , uh-huh . And they did n't used to be actually , but they got kind of wild and were n't doing very well inside , so I put them outside once I got a house and they 're doing great out there , they love it . But the other one , the first one I got he does n't want anything to do with outside unless you 're there . Oh , uh-huh . Other than that he gets scared to death . If you shut that door he goes into hiding . Oh no . I think it 's from the time he jumped off the balcony . Yes , uh-huh , that 's it . And Lord knows what happened to him . He 's probably been through all kinds of nightmares . Right , traumatized for life here . Probably . Oh yeah , we 've , all four of ours are house cats . Are they . We started out with two , with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided he did n't like cats and shot one of them . Oh no . Oh well he lived through it , oh , I could n't believe it . We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills . Oh my gosh . The , the cat almost died , and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat , oh he loves life now . Oh , I imagine . And he 's like oh , thank you so much . I wonder how many of his lives he missed , when that happened . I know , we wondered about that . But , uh , oh that was a traumatic experience for us too . Oh , I can imagine , what did he shoot him with . Uh , well , uh , from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip . Oh my gosh . People are crazy . Oh yes , absolutely nuts . But , uh , luckily enough , you know , we found the cat in time and , uh , rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery and , Oh Lord . tod- , I mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him . Oh man . But oh , he 's been a wonderful cat . I imagine . They usually are after something like that happens to them . It seems to mellow them or something . Oh yes . But , uh , we would n't ha , we would n't have them , I mean , I do n't see us without pets , without cats . No . There 's just , uh , there 's this , they just fill this void . Oh yeah , I ke , I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I do n't , I ca n't take care of them as well because they 're outside , Uh-huh . and it worries me that one day one of them wo n't come back , Yes . and I feel like they need a big home , a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things . But I ca n't give them up . Oh no . I just , I go hysterical when they do n't come home . Right and you worry about , oh , who 's taking care of them . Oh , oh yeah , and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat . Uh-huh . And you go crazy thinking it might be yours . Right , well I did n't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night . We , we- , I had one that had , we had , we had to put to sleep he got so sick . Uh-huh . And , uh , well I fell in love with this , uh , it 's a Chinchilla Persian , Ugh ! and , uh , brought him home , and oh , my husband just died . Really . It was like we ca n't take it back you 've got , we 've got to keep it now . It 's here now , we have to keep it . Yeah , my , my first one that I got , I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment . It took me about two weeks to realize , that was real lonely . Uh-huh , uh-huh , yes . So I found this one and , uh , actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens . Oh uh-huh . And I thought well that 's interesting , I 'll call them . Right . And he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she 'd gotten all her kittens . Oh , uh-huh . And he was the last one she carried across , you know , the whole big sad story . Oh . So of course , I had to take him . I felt so sorry for him after that . Right , right . And he is , uh , you can tell he was weaned too young because he 'll nurse on your ears and your fingers . Oh no . Yeah , he , I asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young , which he was , because his mom was killed , so . Yeah . But he is the lovingest cat . Everybody , people who do n't even like cats , like him . Oh . He never meows , he , he does n't have any front claws , I had him declawed , Oh , uh-huh . but he does n't bite anybody he 's just , he 's just kind of there , real friendly and docile . Oh that 's good . Oh we just , uh , just love them . They , uh , you know , get to feeling so lovey and dovey and they 'll come up and just start kneading in our chest and it 's like oh , your claws need trimming . Oh yeah , yeah , we do , we call that doing biscuits , Oh yes , yes . it looks like they 're kneading bread . Oh it just drives us nuts . Oh , I just love cats . I like dogs , they 're okay , I had , Um , yeah . I had a dog when I lived at home but they 're a lot more trouble than cats actually . They really are . The cats are so independent and they have so much more personality than a dog . Oh yeah , they do . And , but oh , they 're so much fun to watch them play . Oh they are . I love it , it 's so funny to get more than one cat together , because it brings out their personalities . Yes . And they just act so funny . Oh , we 've got , well the two that were outside , they 're like brothers , I mean I 've never seen two cats so close . Really . And , uh , they , uh , will get to playing chase through the house , Uh-huh . and it is hysterical , I mean and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit . It 's like this train . A train of cats running around . I mean it sounds like a train . We have wooden floors and so it just sort of echoes through the house . Oh how funny , I can imagine . Yeah , I would n't give anything for my cats . I love them to death . Oh no , they 're just , they 're , they 're just , uh , they 're wonderful , uh . What are your cats ' names . Uh , we have , uh , Bonzo , Bear , Poindexter , and Felix . Oh , how sweet . And what do you have . I have Xanadu and Precious , and Rascal . Oh . Precious and Rascal are brother and sister and they do n't look a thing a like . Nothing . Precious is a medium hair yellow cat , Uh-huh , yeah . and Rascal is a black and white short hair . Nothing . They do n't look a thing a like , Not a thing , goodness gracious . and they came from the same litter and everything . We have , uh , uh , tortoise which is a black and , and orange . Oh . And she 's so ugly . So ugly she 's cute , right . Yes , uh-huh . I mean you ca n't help but love her . She 's , she 's the oldest one and , but , uh , very possessive . Really . I mean it 's like nobody messes with her mamma . Oh . And , uh , I mean , it comes bedtime and she 's right there . Is she the oldest one ? Yeah , she 's the oldest . And she , well in fact I got her when I moved out of the house also . Really . And so yeah , it 's , uh , would n't have , I mean , oh , if something happens to her . Oh I know it 's like the end of the world . It will be . I know that 's how I am about Xanadu . Oh , goodness . You get so attached to them . Oh definitely . My mother has dogs and I 'm like , no . Yeah . This is nothing like cats . You can walk a dog and that 's okay for weekend but cats are good all the time . Right , I 'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person , no , it would n't have worked . It would n't have , no that would be a problem . Oh that 's one of the requirements I asked him . I said , now you do like cats , right . We do n't li- , Have you seen those , uh , do you ever read COSMO . Yes , uh-huh . There was cartoon in COSMO about a year or two ago and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date and there were cats hanging all over him . Hanging on his clothes , you know , they had ripped him up and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom he said , of course I love cats . And they were just all over him and sitting on his head , the whole nine yards . It was so funny . Oh yeah , oh , the whole time I was pregnant they kept saying , are you getting rid of your cats , are you getting rid of your cats . You ca n't be pregnant and have cats . I 'm like , uh , no , no , no . Watch me . Right , the child will learn to like cats . Definitely . and deal with them , I 'm sorry , we are not getting rid of the cats . Oh I would n't either . There 'd be no way . The whole family was so disappointed . Oh really , oh well . Right . That 's life , that 's how life goes . Right , uh , but yes , we just , just love them to death . I know , I love mine too . Well , it 's been nice talking to you . Well it was nice talking to you too , I enjoyed it . Me to . Bye , bye . Bye , bye .
