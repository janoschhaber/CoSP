Okay , so , um , how do think , how do you think we 've changed in the last ten to twenty years ? Uh , I 'm at a little bit of a loss , you know , I do n't know , ten years ago , see I 'm what , I 'm about , uh , twenty-eight now so -- Uh-huh . -- when I was eighteen , things have n't changed a whole lot . Really . People are being a little more , oh , I do n't know , a little le- , a little less bigoted in some ways , 

I do n't know -- Uh-huh . -- seems to me . Well , I guess I 'm like my parents . The younger generation gets away with hell , but , uh , Yeah . Well , it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted but that may just be because I 've changed . You know , I used to live up north . Down here , Dallas , seems to me , the police are militant -- Really . -- but , uh , Where 'd you live up , where 'd you live at , 

I lived in Akron , Ohio . Oh , did you ? I 'm from MUMBLEx , Illinois , so . Oh . How long , how long you been in Dallas ? Oh , about eight years . Oh , really ? In fact in the eight years I 've been here it seems to me it gets more and more , gets to be more and more restrictive place to live . Yeah , uh -- I think , 

-- you know , uh , as you 're talking like police and stuff like that it 's definitely a tough job to do . Yeah , I think it 's , crime has gone , got a lot worse in the last -- Oh , yeah , I agree . -- last ten , fifteen years , and maybe that has a lot to do with it . Yeah , I , I definitely think that has gotten a lot worse , and you know , I , I think there 's , to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values . Yeah , that 's true . So , That 's true , But , uh , I 'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved -- Yeah . -- but that 's more a matter of , you know -- Yeah . 

-- I 'm no longer a teenager in high school . Yeah , I think there 's more pressure like on both parents to work , and things like that than there used to be and , Hello . Somebody 's at the door . So . Hang on just a second . Okay . . Okay . But , uh , I do n't know , 

that 's just , that 's one thing I see , I see a lot more , you know , double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that , I guess . Yeah , that 's true , it 's getting more and more expensive to live . Yeah , that 's for sure . You ca n't , you ca n't make it , Yeah , without it hardly , that 's right . I guess , when I was growing up , it was , it was still the ideal to get a , get a home and buy house , 

MUMBLEx and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments -- Yeah . -- forever -- Yeah -- -- you know , you just do n't buy a house , -- just because they ca n't get into one , yeah , that 's right . Yeah , 

the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured , you ca n't ever catch a break until you can get into a house -- Yeah . -- in a lot of ways , so . Yeah , that 's , that 's a good point so , I 'm trying to think of anything else that 's changed over the last ten or twenty years . Yeah , for me it 's kind of hard , I do n't know . I think , I do n't know , I think the middle class is shrinking and the , uh , lower class is expanding -- Oh , yeah , I agree . 

-- and sooner or later there 's going to , there 's going to be a turn around . Well , I hope so , you know , at some point but I do n't know at what point , But I think it 's going to be at the expense of the middle class , uh -- Yeah , -- so , usually is -- Yeah . -- I think . It 's , uh , It 's hard for me to say . I hope it happens , because I 'd be one of those that gets caught . But on the other hand , there 's a lot of injustice that needs to be , be changed . Yeah , that 's right . Do you work at T I ? Yeah . Do you ? Yeah . 

What , uh , department do you work in ? I 'm in semiconductor . Are you ? I 'm in semiconductor division too . Yeah . So . How long you been with them , since you moved down here ? About eight years , yeah . Um , I 'm over at the Center One building . Yeah , so am I . Are you really . What floor ? Two . I 'm on the seventh floor . Well , How about that . Well , it 's a small world . So , so let 's see , 

second floor , you work with , uh , linear . Yeah . Do you . Do you , uh , do you know Alec Morton ? Yeah , I 've probably seen him around . Oh , you do , huh . Well , he comes up and pushes us around so , uh , so I 'm pretty familiar with , Are you D A D or something up there ? Huh ? Are you D A D or something ? Yeah . Yep , you must know him . His reputation precedes him . Yeah , well , seventh floor . Yeah , T A D , Well , uh , he , uh , boy , he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief . They , they say it 's what makes him happy is to give us D A D -ers grief , so I can believe it 

but , Well . Yeah , let 's see , if you 've been in Dallas eight years , I guess that 's about how long , I 've been in here about eight years , too , I guess . Um , been with T I like twelve , but I started out in Lubbock . Lubbock is , I do n't know , I guess if this is the only place you 've lived , Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas . Yeah , flat , dry -- Yeah . -- and dirty , Yeah , but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back , too , I mean , here in Dallas everything is just real rush , rush . Yeah , I lived in the country for several years , and living in the city is a whole different -- Oh yeah . -- uh , social structure but , uh , Well , I got some friends that , uh , seems like he went to school at like DeVry . Is there a DeVry in Akron ? I do n't even know -- Oh , -- I have n't been up there in years . Oh , I see , well , he went to school somewhere in Ohio , and he 's from that area , and , uh , he works over in the Park , Park Central building I think but , uh , I have n't talked to him in a while , but , um , yeah , he , he misses it . He used to go back twice or three times a year , you know , because he missed it . Sounds like you have n't been back there in a while . No , I have n't been back in fi- , ten , fifteen years . You still have relatives back there or , Yeah , I do , I just have n't had a chance to get back . Oh . Catch them next year probably . Really . Well , let 's see , how , how long are we supposed to talk here ? I do n't know , I think we ran out of social , social changes to talk about , so . Yeah , well my kids are probably needing me to go so -- Okay , -- all right , well , it 's nice talking to you . Yeah , Talk to you later . All righty , bye . Bye .
