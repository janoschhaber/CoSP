Well , th- , the question was talking about the juries and , uh , one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having , that , especially for repeat offenders that , uh , maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again . 

Uh , so that , uh , a judge , I think , would be the most appropriate person to , uh , to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day . Right . I , I kind of agree with that , because I think in some cases , uh , the jury may not even have , the information about other crimes the person has committed . Right . Uh , I , I think that in some cases that 's considered to prejudice the current case -- Right . -- so a judge , you 're right , should have the whole dossier of the criminal -- Uh-huh . -- there 

and if they 're judged guilty would probably be in a better pri- , position to give an appropriate , uh , sentencing . Yeah . See I agree with you . Uh , one thing I heard was this , where they have , instead of going to the regular court , they have a , a mock court . I mean , it 's supposed to be all legal and everything . Uh , you go and you present your case , the other side presents their case and you 're done with it . 

It 's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V . Uh-huh . Uh , and , uh , but it 's not that we have , uh , such , it did n't backlog or all of the , uh , the cases that are , uh , all ready pending . Uh , so I , that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way . In other words , not , not , 

there would be some types of crimes for which you 're not guaranteed a jury trial ? Yes . Now , I , I , I do n't , th- , there 's a point on which we do n't agree . Uh-huh . I would tend , myself , to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a , anytime a , one of the parties wants one . Uh-huh . 

And I , usually it is the defendant , I guess , that wants to have the jury hear the case . Sure . So I 'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we , uh , take that , you know , that would require a change in the Bill of Rights , I believe and so , and , and I was n't , I did n't mean that . Oh , oh , okay . I , I did n't mean that , no . Because , I mean , gee whiz , if I was , uh , uh , did n't have that right , you know , not to have a jury that , oh yes , I would feel , uh , you 're right , that my civil rights had been violated . But I meant for some , when both parties agreed that yes , we 're going to have a judge here . We 're not going to have a jury , you know , let 's get it over with . 

Sort of like car accidents , you know , Right . Well I think that 's all ready possible . Yeah . I think , that you can waive the right to a , jury trial uh , yeah -- right . -- so . I agree that that should be encouraged . Uh-huh . People should know that that 's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial . 

But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to , to clients unless they feel they can , you know , tweak a jury into -- Right . Giving a different sentence . -- per- , giving a different sentence or possibly , if it 's a civil case , giving higher , uh , you know , awards of money or something -- Uh-huh . -- since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the , the award . The take . Right . Yeah . And I suspect it , in cases like , I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though , rather than civil . 

Is that right ? Well , I , I , i- , we 're at liberty to , to talk and , and meander as long as it 's all on the same theme . Yeah . Uh-huh . Well , uh , in the case of , civil , uh , things , I think maybe the , the use of the jury is very , often to the lawyer 's advantage and I think that may be where jury use is overdone , 

I mean there are cases where they could be settled , maybe -- -- out of court a little more efficiently . Right . But the lawyers are really , uh , it 's to their advantage to play to as big an audience , as possible -- -- so . Uh , I was wondering too , if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases -- Uh-huh . -- not just sentencing in , in a criminal cases . Uh-huh . Uh , I 'm not so sure I 'm in favor of that . But I am in favor of it for criminal cases so there 's a difference of my view there for those two . Right . Right . Yeah , bu- , well you can tell I have n't been in too many juries , judges chambers or anything like that . Have you ever had to serve jury duty ? N- , well I was called once when I was nineteen -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me and , I was doing school and things like they , they let me out . Uh-huh . An- , I 've never had to it since and that was almost twenty years ago . Uh-huh . It is n't , sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time , in , uh , that would have been about , uh , twenty years too -- -- uh , uh , just last year and , uh , the case I heard was a criminal case and it seemed it really , trivial . It involved two bicycles . We did n't do the sentencing . The judge did . Huh . So -- How interesting . -- we , we a- , rendered a verdict and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing . Uh-huh , Uh-huh . And that was here in Wisconsin . 

So I , I do n't know if that varies from state to state or if it ,
