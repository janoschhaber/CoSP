Well what kind of car , uh , are you thinking of buying next ? Uh , more than likely , it 's going to be a Chrysler . You like the Chrysler products , do you ? Uh , Chrysler LeBaron , yeah . It wo n't be a Ford . I 've got a Ford Mustang now , and I hate it . Do you really ? Yeah . What year is it ? It 's a eighty-eight . 

And why do n't you like the Mustang ? It 's , um , I 've had one problem with it after the other . I 'll be darned . The pa- , the paint 's peeling off of it , Well , you know the old sayings about Fords , what they stand for . There you go . 

-- or find them re- , road dead . Well , uh . That , uh , I , uh , it 's , my electrical system shorted out like two or three times , and it 's been torn up since April , and I , and luckily , everything was under warranty , so it 's only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed . It would have been like two thousand . Well , we 've always , uh , we 've always had Oldsmobiles , and , uh , been very , uh , happy with Oldsmobiles , but , uh , my wife thought she wanted to get a Ford Mustang and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be one of those , uh , Mitsubishi Eclipses . 

She real- , Those , those are nice cars . She likes , uh , likes those . She has a sister that lives in , uh , Phoenix that has one and , uh , really , uh , enjoys it . Well , what , uh , what things do you consider when you buy a car ? Um , the gas mileage for one thing , and I 've , I 've , I 've always had like stick shift . I want to , the next car I get I want it to be automatic . I see . I , uh , I , I hate driving anyway , and then , and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now . Yeah , especially when you 're in high traffic areas -- Yeah . -- and have to mess with that all the time . 

And , you know , when you work nine to five , or eight to five , and you 're in rush hour traffic to and from work , unfortunately . That makes it very frustrating . And I look , and one of the things with Chrysler right now is , is their , the warranties that they have , and I , I feel like their , everybody I 've talked to that owns one , has , has , has been real pleased with it , and I like the , the driver 's air bag , 

I like that . Now this is a LeBaron ? Uh , yeah , well all Chrysler products has it in there , but LeBaron would be the next car I get , yeah . I sure like the , uh , convertible , those rag top LeBarons , they really look sporty . Yeah , yeah , I like , I like that too , huh , 

but , uh , I , I could n't afford the insurance on one of those . Well , uh , we always , this last Oldsmobile we bought , uh , it 's an eighty-seven , but we bought it in eighty-eight , you know , right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them -- Yeah . -- and , uh , we found that , uh , we found a real good interest rate , you know , when they 're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that , they really come down on their prices and , uh , uh , you know , we looked around at used cars , and we really could n't , uh , afford the payments on a used car , because , uh , if you go to the bank and try to get a loan , they want to charge twelve , thirteen percent , you know , 

and we ended up , I think , with like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car , and the payments . Well , that 's what I 'm paying on mine now . I had to get like a first time , my dad 's always cosigned on , on my , my loans , or whatever , and this is one , when I bought , I got my Mustang this time was by myself , because I got on my own , or whatever , and , um , I had said , they , they said it had to be like a first time buyer 's car or whatever , and they 're charging me unreasonable MUMBLEx interest , but I 've got eight more payments 

and it 's paid for . Well , that 's great . But I got it when , I got it when the eighty-eights first came out , it 's a , it 's , it 's a good car , I mean , I got in eighty-seven , I guess , in like November or something like that , and . Uh-huh . Well , when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door . Our first car was an Oldsmobile back in seventy-seven . It was a two door Cutlass Supreme , and , uh , it just happened that when we looked for our , our new car , they had a thing going with Oldsmobile and if you 'd buy a , a new Oldsmobile they 'd give you four hundred rebate , because it was their seventy-fifth anniversary . Uh-huh . I belie , yeah seventy-fifth anniversary . So in addition to everything else we got off the car , all we had to do is show them our , uh , papers on our first car , and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it . So we , we got a four door this time , and I sort of went more for the , uh , the comfort factor , and , uh , I liked the smaller cars , but I 'm a bigger person , and I , I really like comfort , you know , driving along the road and stuff . Well , that 's another big factor of mine . Next , next car I get 's going to be a four door too . Something with some room . Yeah . Because I , uh , my Mustang is , is , is two door with bucket seats , and you buy groceries and stuff like that . 

And if you try to take anybody , you know , go to the show or go out for supper , and you go as a foursome ,
