Where do you get most of your news ? I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour , and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends . Where , where are you ? I 'm in Dallas . Oh , yeah . Are you in Dallas also ? No , I 'm in San Antonio . Oh , really , okay . I get my news from a combination of sources . 

I take the paper every day -- Uh-huh . -- and I read it on the way in to work on the , in a carpool . Oh , really . Uh-huh . And , uh , and I watch the , uh , actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work . 

And then , you know , usually over lunch , there 'll be a big topic of conversation on something -- Uh-huh . -- from the news . I normally find that uh , I- , I 'm probably the most , um , news hungry of my friends , so I do n't , we do n't normally talk about the news at lunch . I , I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend , simply because I used to get it during the week -- Uh-huh . -- but , um , I would always end up arriving at work late , because I would always end up skimming the headlines , spending too much time , reading it in the morning . Yeah . So I have to cut myself down to the weekend , plus after work . Um , the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television -- Uh-huh . -- and I enjoy that quite a bit . Yeah . Um , one of the women that I work with , her husband is Iranian . Uh-huh . So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we 've had some very interesting conversations over lunch . I will admit I work with , uh , someone who 's Iranian , and he definitely has a very different slant on the news . Uh-huh . He 's very , very skeptical of the news media , and I will admit I 'm reasonably skeptical also . But he 's , I do n't know , uh , he 's mu- , much , much more so . It 's sort of interesting though , because he does bring a , a much , um , different perspective with all the Gulf goings on , um . He was always speaking in terms of , you know , American imperialism reasserting itself . Um , I suppose it 's a different attitude that we normally do n't hear in the country . Uh-huh . Well I , I , uh , I like the print news -- Uh-huh . -- much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize . True , um , the , I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably does n't . They , um , tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story . Uh-huh . They will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time . Sort of like the , uh , what is that , A B C 's NIGHTLINE . Uh-huh . Well , I guess they only normally stick with just the one , um , story . But they , they can do a much better job since they do n't have to chop it into little two minute stories . They do n't report on every murder and shooting that happened in , in every little town . No , no . It 's very much national interest news . Yeah . A lot of times they end up , um , with these panels of experts and they go back and forth , where everyone 's giving some opinions and sometimes that , I do n't know the value of that , because I saw plenty of jokes and , and , um , oh , editorial cartoons about all the retired generals , making a living during the , the Gulf War . I 've been getting a kick out of those lately . Uh-huh . Although , um . I- , I 'm only twenty-five , so I 've never actually been through a period of war -- Uh-huh . -- and I do n't know anyone in the military and I do n't have a lot of background knowledge in , uh , military strategy and , and weaponry , and , and all that kind of stuff . And I thought the generals were very interesting . Now when they started to speculate , I , I saw that for what is was , Uh-huh . and thought all of these guys do n't know what 's going on . But I thought the- , the- , they were interesting , and , and they shed some light on what was going on for me . I will admit it 's interesting . I- , I- , I 'm twenty-six . So I do n't have any more experience in that than you . Um , it , it , it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind , you know , there were some that were screaming for air power , there were some that were saying the air power was n't going to do it . Uh-huh . And they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world , which I suppose just about everyone does , but these guys had a , a , uh , national soap box to stand on and , and express this view . You know , one of the best television news shows that I saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on A B C , and it was for children -- Uh-huh . -- and it was hosted by Peter Jennings , and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio , and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions . And they , they had all their correspondents in the different areas , in Saudi Arabia , and Israel , and , and all . They had them all , uh , on , I do n't know what you 'd call it other than on line . They had them all on hold -- Uh-huh . -- and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer , they would cut to that person , and that person would answer the question . It was just very informative and interesting , and , uh , I was real impressed at how A B C handled , uh , translating , Uh-huh . the war for children . Yeah , I did n't see anything like that , although I did , uh , I guess one thing that I found sort of interesting , this is getting a little off the topic , but there was a , a , a big push with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with counselors -- Uh-huh . -- to , to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children . I thought that was a really unusual thing . And our local H E B stores here , I do n't know if it 's H E B statewide or whatever , but they have videos that , uh , I do n't know if they still have them , but they were free rental , Uh-huh . videos , that had something to do with the war . Ju- , -- Uh , it was , -- It- , with the children 's aspect ? Right . It was something for children , that they , they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and , uh , getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it -- Uh-huh . -- and that kind of thing . I suppose that is a valuable service . Again not having , uh , lived through another war , I do n't know if that 's a common thing that people thought of , or if that was -- Well -- -- a new concern with people . -- back during the Viet Nam conflict that no one will , will have the guts enough to call a real war -- Uh-huh . -- uh , the , that type of technology just was n't at people 's disposal . That 's true . That 's true . So I do n't think there 's ever been a war that 's been so thoroughly covered by the news . And probably more importantly , one that lasted short enough that , that people 's interest did n't flag too badly . Yeah . I tell you what , the first three days , I was glued to the television . I will admit the same thing . And I , And I , would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer and they would run these extended two , three hour versions of the program -- Yeah . -- and I , I was just , I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing . I tell you what . The uh , the war start- , let 's see , was it a Wednesday or Thursday ? Must have been Thursday , uh , and Friday night I was , I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning , sitting , right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open . Uh-huh . Because I was watching C N N , and they would , they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus , and the people would be standing there in gas masks , and you 'd be hearing the sirens , and it was just , I was amazed . Uh-huh . I , I did n't have that experience . I , I do n't have cable -- Oh . -- so I , I 'm pretty much limited to P B S , which I thought , I thought they did a very good job . Uh-huh . Um , I 've got one question for you . I you say you take the newspaper . Uh-huh . Um , I , I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting . We 've got the one fairly , well , relatively weaker paper , the TIMES HERALD , and then the MORNING NEWS , which has a very strong subscription . Uh-huh . Does San Antonio ha , you said San Antonio , right ? Uh-huh . Do you have just one paper , or do you have several ? No . There are two , and they 're pretty close . Uh , the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper , I grew up near Houston -- Uh-huh . -- and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck , and the one I picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as I was growing up . I mean , the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff . Uh-huh . It 's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over , and I enjoy , the comics are better in this newspaper . This newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy and the other one has some weird ones that I 've never heard of . So , I , I actually take both newspapers on the weekends . Do you ? I figure I 'm only taking on the weekend , and I can afford that . Yeah . I , I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better , but I sort of have a liberal political slant , and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial , um , outlook . And my , I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit . My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers . He takes both San Antonio papers , an Austin paper , both Houston papers , I guess he takes seven , the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper , but he 's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University , so he 's getting all the sports sections . Uh-huh . And , so , you know , he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread ...
