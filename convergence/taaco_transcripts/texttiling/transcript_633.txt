Budgeting activity in our household I , has is , uh , uh , kind of an informal kind of situation . We , we , you know , put , actually what happens is , uh , is , my check gets automatically deposited . I do n't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore . It just gets deposited . 

And , and , and my , my wife , you know , you know , looks at all those bills that come in and , you know , and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them . You see , and so our , our budgeting , w- , we really do n't have a formal budgeting situation . Every time I 've ever tried one , it 's , uh , I 've just got wrapped in my inertia . And , uh , I 've just decided not to pursue it . Uh , what , what 's your budget situation ? Well , actually , uh , I 've , I 've had a couple of different situations . My current one has been the most successful . Uh , at a certain point in life an- , my husband , my ex-husband was an alcoholic . And we got divorced back in the mid-seventies and that left me with three teenagers . You know , well a- , a- , actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets . It certainly is . Is n't it ? But at any rate , what happened was that I , I just absolutely put away all the credit cards . I did n't rip them up . I did n't send them back . Nothing . I just put them away . Because there was one that it was really handy to have . If I absolutely had to have something , I could go use it . Uh-huh . But , uh , mostly we just spent cash . Whatever we had . And if we did n't have it , we absolutely did n't spend it . But then , as things improved , you know . Once , once I got them all through college , uh , it came to the point where , uh , my parents came through the depression . I 'm not sure how old you are . Well , my , you know , my , my parents too . You , you -- But my , -- you were born in , in the , in the late thirties or early forties . Late thirties , yeah . Uh-huh . Yeah . And , uh , my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house . And that 's kind of the way I was raised . And so I 'm not a very demanding person in , in that aspect . So for quite a period of time , I just flat did n't spend any money . Um . Now , meanwhile , I got , had a , a building bank balance . And my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have , I would have the cash to buy it right then and there . Uh-huh . And not ever have to spend any money on interest . Well , that , that 's good . And that , that 's the way I 've operated ever since then . It , and you know , if , if something goes on sale and I do n't have the money , I still do n't buy it . Well , we , we buy what , well , we just got through buying a twenty-five foot refrigerator , a new ceramic top stove , and a new dishwasher . Oh my . And , and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge . Along with my trip to Japan -- Oh my ! -- which was , was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars and you know . Oh my . Right . I mean , we just , we got a monster , you know , bill coming in . But , but we also have zero in- , interest being paid . And we pay it off as , as it goes . Uh-huh . And that 's the way I do my credit cards now . Yeah . So we never really get that much over , uh , over extended . Yeah . I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards . Huh . But it 's the fact that I have enough of a , of a cushion in the bank so that when they come , I can pay them in full . Yeah . We 're , we 're doing that . We have , you know , uh , th- , this is our , our , our big , uh , we did redecorating . Two , you know , two new pieces in the ref- , in the family room and new carpet . I mean we just -- Oh my . -- uh , we 've just been spending , spending , spending . I 'm envious . Well I , Bu- , but we have n't really done anything for a long time because we 've , we 've had two kids in college that -- Uh-huh . -- just have graduated in the past year . So we 're , you know , we do n't have that . It 's time for you to do these things then . Right ? Yeah , it 's , uh , it 's about time that we did that . and it all looks still pretty good to me . Why , why we need to replace it ? But , but , un- , unfortunately my , my , my wife really feels as though it 's , it 's just been an inappropriate , uh , thing to , to , I mean that rug is thirteen years old , why not replace it . I mean , uh , I say it might go for another thirteen but , uh , too late , we 'll never find that out . This is so funny . That 's wonderful . But -- And , -- you 're lucky to have her because if you 're like me and you have difficulty spending money , you need somebody to help you spend it . I mean , certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should , be or not . You know , I , I , I do n't spend that much money . I just , uh , we just sort of have had , uh , you know , too many obligations to , you know , we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they , they got through school . And that was the major , you know , decade of expenses , you know . So we , we feel as , uh , but as far as any formal budgeting , uh , you know , I , I , we just apparently have been very fortunate . When we went , want to go out to eat , we go out to eat . We never really , you know , have to program money for that or make choices , you know . But , uh , we do n't have that uproarious a , a lifestyle . After all , we 're ,
