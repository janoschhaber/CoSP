Okay , um , I guess , um , this is probably really a good subject for me because I really like to do , uh , hand work . Uh , mostly I do needlepoint , I guess . Oh really . But , um , What kinds of things have you done ? Um , well , I 've made a lot of baby gifts . Uh-huh . It seem like that 's , 

like , especially lately there 's been so many babies , that , uh , bibs and blankets , and things like that . Wall hangings , um , Do you ever keep any of your stuff ? Is n't that funny . No . I do crochet and a lot of , uh , things like that , and I have very little of my own stuff , and it 's kind of embarrassing . People say let me see some of your work . Oh well , can you do it MUMBLEx ? Yeah , is n't that funny . I guess I do have one thing . A friend of mine gave me a clock kit -- Ooh . -- and , I , I needlepointed the face , and I , uh , kept that because she gave me that . So , That , that would be definitely something you 'd want to keep . Oh , yeah . And it 's real neat . Was , was the whole face done or just the numbers , and , and , like minute marks ? Um , basically , the whole , well , no , I guess the minute marks , but the minute marks are done , they 're like hearts . Oh . And then the , at the numbers they , they 're kind of outlined and stuff . It , it was quite bit of work , but , you know , it was a lot of fun , too . I really like doing stuff like that . So . I did some needlepoint years ago , and then I got into the Bargello . Oh , what 's that ? Well , it 's an Italian , um , needlework , using , using the uh , I started to say the canvas , but the , uh , huh , what kind of cloth uses that . I , I 've just gone blank . But it 's used with yarn , and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth -- Huh . -- and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors . Like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you 're making a design like a geometric or whatever , and it was used quite often in the colonial times to , uh , uh , to upholster chairs , and so forth , as well as the crewel , um , embroidery work that was done on them . Wow , that 's interesting . What did you , what kind of things did you do ? What I did , when I was doing that was mostly pillows , you know , for sofas and so forth , and I ca n't find one that I 've done . Oh . It 's one of those things I did , I did n't give them away , but I did n't know if it 's been my color choice or multiple moves -- Yeah , -- or , or what , and it , I was so proud of them when I got them finished , but I have no idea where they are . What did you call that ? Bargello . It 's B , A , R , G , E , double L , O Huh . That 's , I 've never heard of that before . I 've probably seen it , though , I suspect you , I mean , when you described it . I suspect you have . Yeah . I mean , when you described it , it sounded like something , you know , that would be around , I guess . But , I 've never heard of it before , and it 's really interesting . Um , I guess I 've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past , but I 've kind of gotten out of that . I use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows . Me , too . Really . Yes . That 's interesting . Yeah , it is . How did you know to choose this subject , tonight . That 's funny . What , how did you , what kinds of decorations did you use with the bas- , how were you decorating the baskets ? Oh , basically bows and lace -- Um . -- uh , ribbons . Um . I really wanted to do , you know , so many of them now have the ribbons where , I 'm not sure how they do it , but the ribbons , they make them , they like . I do n't know how to explain it . They make them hard , you know ? Like fabric that 's been stiffened . Yeah . Yes . I 've never done that , and those are so neat . I mean , I would really like to do those I 've seen some , and there , there , they , I suspect they 're fairly simple , because the one lady I 've seen , I know that does it , I 've never asked her any questions , but she has three kids all under the age of like six . And , and they 're all a handful . So it 's got to be something she can do fairly easily -- Oh , definitely , yeah . -- and fairly quickly . When I do , um , crochet , it 's usually the lacy Victorian type -- Oh . -- things like that , and I stiffen those with a , a glue mixture . It 's like white glue , and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then , um , allowed to dry in those , those draping bows , I mean , those draping streamers . Oh . I do n't know . I was just . There 's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that 's very similar -- Yeah . -- that 's not going to melt too much with , uh , uh , high humidity , That 's -- in a room , -- I think that 's what my concern was , was it really sure , and how they would , how they would last . Do you know what my concern is ? How will I dust this thing ? You 're right . That 's terrible . No that 's true . That 's funny . So many of my crafts , well , right now I 'm looking at a little quilted , uh , uh , hanging , it 's , like , it 's a flag , and I do n't want to wash it , because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth , but it 's such a dust collector to be out , and so forth . Yeah . And most of my things are dust collectors . Uh , and I hate to dust . I know . So first thing I think of is how easy would this , thing be to clean . That 's funny . No , I do some , I have really gotten out of it . I do n't do it quite as much as I used to . Um , I guess because I , I went back to school , so I do n't have as much time . Oh , you do n't have time . No , and I have two children also . You definitely do n't have time . It keeps me very busy . But I really enjoy it when I do do it , when I get the chance , you know . It 's really , it 's so relaxing to just sit , and , but once I get started , I ca n't put it down . I just , I have a similar problem . I 've got to have time or I do n't even want to get into it in the first place . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . And so I end up lots of time not doing anything at all . I know , I started a project , it 's been over a year ago that I swore I was going to finish for somebody for Christmas . You just did n't say which Christmas , right . That 's what I keep telling this person , well , I did n't tell you what year . What was this project ? Um , well , it 's a , it 's uh , cross stitch , and it 's a picture , and it 's a wildlife , it has deer and trees and , it 's really beautiful , but it 's going to be a lot of work , and you know , I 've , I have worked on it quite a bit , but not as much as I 'd like to . You know , it 's just so hard . Now this is done in the needlepoint ? Uh-huh . Well , I should , it 's counted cross stitch , actually , is what I 'm doing , and so it 's really , since it 's counted , you know , it 's really a lot of work . Yes . Yes , I do know . Yeah . I have done a little bit of that , but I decided that that 's something that demands my tim- , my , my total attention . Uh-huh . And so I 've got to have total , almost total silence . I ca n't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate . It sounds like you 'd have lots of shading -- Uh-huh . -- on that particular piece . Yep . It is not , does not sound like an easy one to finish . No , it really is n't , and I tell you , really , I could just kick myself for even starting it , because I have a feeling I 'm never going to get it done . I 'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life . Oh , I 'm sure you 'll get it done , but it just may not of the original , obviously not of the original time schedule . No , that 's true . I , I just do n't know when I 'm ever , it just seems like there 's just never enough time to pick it up and do it , you know , it 's just really hard . But I really do en , like I said I really enjoy it when I do . It 's just hard . Just hard finding the time -- Uh-huh . -- that can be dedicated . And there 's , there 's so many other things that , I , I have done , you know , in the meantime , like I said , so many baby gifts . I 've made a lot of bibs , and wall hangings , and so , you know , those do n't take much time at all . So it 's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them . Do you , do you use patterns , I mean , like a book of patterns , or do you go out an buy a , a kit , like for a bib or something like that . No , I usually just buy a pattern book . I have several pattern books , and I just go with those . Okay . And then I buy the bibs separate . Usually I think it 's a little bit cheaper in the long run , and then I just use whatever colors I want to . I do n't usually use the colors they tell me to . Um . And it , it depends on what it is , you know . But some things , especially letters , if they suggest certain colors for letters , I just go with whatever I want to . That 's what I would do , too . Yeah , yeah . Or whatever I have . There 's yeah , there 's a few designs I guess I 've done myself , but not very many . Real simple ones , you know , I do . I 've made , I made a little , uh , little , uh , little thumb print and made it a bunny . Ooh . It was really easy . I mean , just , just did a thumb print . You know . What . With ink ? Uh-huh . Oh , okay . And then , see I did n't cross stitch the actual thumb print , you know , that was just the ink , and then I made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth . That was so simple . Oh , that sounds really neat . It did n't take anything at all . Did you do , did you use , like , uh , a stamp pad -- Uh-huh . And then I just , -- and ink . Ok so you , just like being finger printed ...
