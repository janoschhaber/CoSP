Okay , uh , could you tell me what you think contributes most to , uh , air pollution ? Well , it 's hard to say . I mean , while it 's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories , uh , pollute a lot , uh , if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano , uh , it 's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all . 

What do you think ? Um , well , you talked about , uh , volcanos . I 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now , and , and what the amount of material that they do , uh , put into the atmosphere . I think probably the greatest cause is , uh , vehicles , Uh-huh . especially around cities . Um , uh , do you live right in the city itself ? No , I 'm more out in the suburbs , but I certainly work near a city . Okay , so ca , How about you ? Can you notice , well it 's , it 's , 

I live in a rural area . Uh-huh . It 's mainly farms and , uh , no heavy industry . Attleboro , itself , I live in Rhode Island . Oh , I see . And , it 's in the north , I live up in the , uh , northeast corner 

and Attleboro sits in just over the line , Uh-huh . where T I 's plant is , but there is n't a lot of heavy industry . There 's the freeways and we get an occasional , it depends which way the wind 's blowing from Boston , cause we 're like forty miles south of Boston , so we 'll pick up that . And , uh , I 've noticed over the past say , maybe five or six years , uh , we live about twenty miles away from the state airport and I notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger , they 're swinging wider so that now they are coming over , over our homes . Uh-huh . And , it seems like , uh , we 're catching all that residue . I 'm not sure if it 's kerosene or what that 's dropping . 

But , other than that , you know , we do n't have the , unless we 're catching it from the midwest , the emissions . Yeah . You know from the power plants . Um . You mean like from the coal . Yeah , yeah , we generate , one of our , our biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal to , uh , Um , generate electricity . Um , there does n't seem to be much emission from them , 

but I 'm not sure about the rest of the country . Yeah , I notice locally a major problem is Kodak . Um , it 's interesting because in order to , uh , keep with the E P A standards which , which tend to be visible , uh , what 's coming out of your smokestack , they do all their emissions at night . Uh , so people get up , Okay , well , is that right ? . Yeah , people get up in the morning in that neighborhood 

and they 've got this black ash on their cars ,  which , you know , seems to be , Yeah , surprise , surprise . Yeah , I mean , I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they 'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades , light up the sky , photograph the emissions at that point , and , uh , you know , Yeah . There , there must be , uh , uh , some of the , some of the , uh , larger plants up , uh , up around one hundred twenty-eight . Uh-huh . Um , we 've got reports that , uh , 

during the night seems like they 'd blow off their , their stacks from , uh , Right . the warehouses , for powerhouses , Uh-huh . and , they do that at night too , because , Right . employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted , and , you know , spots all over them . Yeah , yeah . So , you 're right , they could do something a- . about , about that , I guess . Yeah . That seems a little ridiculous . How are your , uh , your lakes , and , uh , Oh they 've been getting cleaner . They have ? Sure . But , um , yeah , I 'm not sure how much the water pollution is , is directly related to the air pollution , other than acid rain , 

yeah , Acid rain , yeah , that 's , that 's what I was , uh , I mean the stuff I 've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit , uh , overstated . That a lot of the die off they 've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all . Um , ye- , I 'm not an expert . Yeah , no . Did n't they just have an article , oh , on , uh , they were dumping lime . 

Up here ? Up , upstate New York somewhere , I have n't read that . over huge areas , Oh yeah . and they thought that was more beneficial because , you know it , it , some of it does soak in and some of it runs off right away into the , in to the streams and rivers and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback . Uh-huh . I ca n't remember where I , I read that recently somewhere , and I ca n't remember where . Yeah , that 's interesti , But I , I thought it was up there . So , that 's interesting because New Hampshire , Uh-huh . 

and parts of Vermont , um , they showed pictures of , of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain . Um . Um , you kind of think it 's something else then ? Well , that 's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article . So that , Oh , they did n't say , they did n't say what though , they just said they thought it was , They did n't say what , they just said they thought acid rain 's contribution may be less than was previously suspected . Um , that it may be other natural things at work . Um , Uh , natural disease , Yeah , so it 's , it 's less than clear . Like I said , I do n't remember the article that well . Yeah , yeah . But , um , I do n't know , I mean , what do you think we can , uh , I guess as individuals or as a group , do about , uh , air pollution ? . Uh , we can demand , uh , more efficient automobiles for one thing . 

I still think that 's , that 's , uh , one of our major causes of pollutants . Uh-huh . Uh , how we go about that , it 's uh , uh , it 's a little bit difficult . I think it 's up to individuals too , to ask automakers for , Yeah , for less pollutant vehicles . Yeah , 

you ne , yo- , ne , I think you need a , a vehicle something like , uh , Ralph Nader , Nader 's Raiders , or , Yeah . where , uh , or , uh , uh , A A R P , which has a lot of members . Uh-huh . Uh , if you can get those types of groups . Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem . I mean , I remember reading an article that said like , it 's , uh , the older polluters , 

the , the twelve and fifteen year old cars , you know , contribute like ninety percent , Yeah , of the automobile pollution and the new cars it 's hardly is , hardly anything . Yeah , they 're better , but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there . Uh , when was the last time you saw a truck that did n't belch , smoke , or , uh , Yeah , but does n't that just mean they 're out of tune . Uh , I 'm not really sure . You think that , that , that the , uh , the trucking indus- , industry is that , uh , incompetent , that they would n't , you know , 

fuel is , is one of their biggest costs . Right . So , you would , But diesel engines . Yeah , diesel engines . It , you know , it 's , it , I mean , they do generate a lot of soot but that at least , that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly . Yeah . Yeah . We could also , uh , push for legislation for , uh , rapid transit systems . 

This country seems to be a little behind on that . Yeah . On the other hand most people do n't use rapid transit because it 's so inconvenient . Um , yeah , but only because we got used to , uh , single person , single car , Uh-huh . driving . A lot of people do n't even like to carpool . Uh-huh . But we could that . That 'll help , Uh-huh . pollution , air pollution , 

The , uh , United States and Canada are I guess , is , is , going into , uh , some types of agreements to limit , uh , what 's being given out by power plants , Uh-huh . I guess Canada 's quite concerned that we 're sending a lot of our stuff up there , Yeah , sure . So that 's helping . Well , what do you think about like a device , a meter right on a tail pipe and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted ? Now that 's an idea . do n't say that too loud though because , uh , every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue , Well , it just means if you do n't pollute , right , or you pollute very little you do n't have to pay any tax or you just buy one of these things and it , it , uh , maybe you , you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe and , uh , the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe and you could n't start your car anymore . That 's a , that 's an interesting concept . Is that your idea ? Yeah , but , uh , you know , it 's , uh , I guess the difficulty would be to , that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something . Well I was going to say , right . You could put it in , you could , you could , it could be installed like a catalytic converter . Right . I mean I guess you could take those off too but , You could take ca- , but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off . Yeah , if you can take a muffler off and only replace , well not unless it was built into every muffler . Right . And that 's MUMBLEx . But if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that , uh , busses and any kind of vehicle ,  had to pay a pollution tax , uh , this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters , That 's a , that 's quite a concept . You should , uh , pursue that I think , or patent it , you know . Yeah , patent it , that 's a good idea . If you could come up with a device that 's the thing . Right . But it should n't be too hard to do something like that . But that 's a , that 's a thought . No , Uh-huh . you 're right and that will solve , uh , a lot of problems . I do n't know if you , uh , if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that . Uh-huh . Uh , but you know a proposal to , uh , uh , I guess the proper authorities , Uh-huh . well you might , uh , generate some -- Yeah , the automobile regulatory agencies or something . -- yeah , you might generate some interest in it . But that 's , that 's a good idea . Other than that I 'm not sure what , what individuals can do other than like I said get involved through a group or an organization . Uh-huh .
