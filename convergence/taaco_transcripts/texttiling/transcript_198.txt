Okay Okay , uh , the question was about , uh , physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise . Uh-huh . Well , uh , I , I do n't do it as much as I should . I try to walk . Uh-huh . And , uh , last year I would , I did it every day , but I 've kind of , in ninety-one I 've kind of gone down hill . Uh-huh . And so I 'm not doing it as much as I need to , 

but I , I can tell you when I do do it on a regular basis I feel so much better -- I agree . -- and so much healthier . But it 's just to get motivated to do it , and once I get started , and , and , I , I , I ca , I do it every night . Uh-huh . It 's just to get , uh , motiv , motivated again , and what happened about couple of weeks ago I started again . And I was walking , 

and it got kind of dark . Uh-huh . And I was by myself , and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block . Ooh . And , so I , I kind of got frightened , and I kind of use that as an excuse . All I have to do , is start earlier , but . Right . I have n't walked since , so . It 's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise . I know what you mean . Yeah , it sure is . It sure is . How about you ? Do you exercise on a regular basis ? Um , well , I try to . Um , I started at the beginning of this year , I decided all right , I 'm going to start exercising again , I 'm going to be real good , and I went through the T I fitness center and registered for the , uh , aerobics classes there . Uh-huh . And they run for two months at a time . And you have to , you do have to pay to take them . And I took , I signed up for one that was three nights a week , an hour and a half , so that was four and a half hours a week . Oh . And it cost sixty dollars , and I thought , okay , that 's not cheap , that 'll encourage me to always go since I spent that much money . Right . And I had a friend of mine going , so I was real good , I only missed it about three times . And then , oh , March came around , and I signed up again , and I got , uh , caught up with a class I was taking at T I , and then I was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after I got out of class . Uh-huh . And then I went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the T I up there . And so that was two weeks I had missed , and , boy , I tell you what , I 've been terrible ever since then . Yeah , it 's once you get out of that habit -- Uh-huh . -- you just do n't , you do n't get back into it . Because I teach school , and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class . We went in together and hired a private instructor , and she came to our school twice a week . Uh-huh . And , I , I was , I would go faithfully , and then I missed once . Then I went back again a couple times and missed another time , and then kept missing and never went back again . Uh-huh . I think , if you , you just have to stick with it . Oh , yeah . I think I 've been two maybe three times the month of April , and this session is about to run out . Now I signed up for a different one now that 's only two nights a week because I am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes and -- Uh-huh . -- some of them require me to go out of town , and , and , uh , that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that . Yeah . lately , uh , there 's been nights that I could have gone and I 've found excuses , uh -- Yeah . -- things like I had the flu last week , but I 'm fine this week . I could have gone Monday . I could have gone tonight , and I did n't . Yeah . So , I 'm kind of finding excuses , and now it 's kind of like , well , this is the last week . I 'll just start fresh next week . But , I better , better do it . And I think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months was n't the second two months . She started taking tennis lessons , and so I have n't had that extra motivation , of , of us forcing each other , or not forcing each other -- Yeah . -- but encouraging each other to go . So . Sure , yeah that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing . Uh-huh . Like it 's misery loves company . I do n't really love exercise . I mean , some I , the neighbor across the street , she goes , belongs to President 's , and , uh , it 's not President 's any more . I do n't know what the name of it is anymore . But she loves it . Uh-huh . I mean , it 's just , it 's an automatic high for her . Uh-huh . She just enjoys it so much . And I do n't . Yeah . I 'm the same way . I feel good after I do it , but I hate it when I 'm doing it . Yeah . You know , I just , I do n't enjoy it at all , and she just loves it . So . Even when she does n't go to the health club , she runs , you know . Uh-huh . And , it 's a daily thing for her . So , it , you know , and it 's so hard for me . I envy her , I wish I could be that way , but I do n't . I do too . I do n't , and I have an older sister that loves running , too , and she runs all the time , but at , to me , it 's every minute 's agony , and I , in fact , I do n't run . I hate to run . Uh-huh . Like when I walk I 'll take along a radio or something and that helps , you know , pass the time . Right . Yeah , walking is kind of boring . I do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood , and we try to , we used to try to get together , and I think now that the weather 's getting nicer we 're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking . There 's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex . Uh-huh , uh-huh . And it 's not as boring if you get several people -- That 's right . -- and you can kind of talk , and , and it , it makes it pass pretty quickly , and the aerobics is n't too boring . I kind of enjoy it when I 'm doing it . Um , it 's a lot more fun than some other things I could do , I guess . Yeah , yeah . But , uh , I do , I do have to make myself go , and of course while I 'm doing it I feel pretty good , and after I get finished I feel great . Oh , it 's great afterwards , yeah . I mean , I can go in there , I can be , like a Friday afternoon when I 'm tired , it 's the end of the week and I just want to go home . And I 'll make myself go , and I 'll have headache and everything , and I get out , I do n't have a headache any more . I feel great , and I 'm just , it 's amazing how much better I feel . Yeah . And then just in general , I sleep a lot better -- Yeah , that 's right . -- and I just feel much better . I mean , I 've been kind of dragging the last few weeks , and I know if I would just get around to exercising -- Exactly -- -- I 'd feel better . -- it does , it gives you energy . But my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising . Yeah . Well , I 'm too tired , or I have a headache or , well , I just got over the flu , and I 'm still kind of draggy so I better not go . It 's kind of a vicious circle is n't it ? Yeah , it really is . Yeah , I find , too , that I have more energy when I exercise , and , you know , it 's silly not to , but , I do n't know , it 's just a put off . I do n't know why I do n't do more , and I , and I know that it 's good for my health . I know , you know , from everything that you read and you see on television now , exercise is so important to good health . Right . So , you know , you , not only , you know , you 're not only doing something to keep yourself fit , but you 're probably prolonging your life . So . Right . There 's no reason that we should n't do it , but I do n't know . It 's just hard to make yourself go . And I , I think one thing I do n't like about aerobics is that after I 'm finished it 's kind of late at night , and I 've been sweaty , and , and it , you know , I do n't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands . Yeah . So it kind of kills the evening for doing errands . So I think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better . Yeah . Of course , I feel like once I 've done it , if I 'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes , because you 've already kind of shot your night . Right . But , um , so I 'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday , Thursday now that I can just kill two nights , and -- Yeah . -- and , uh , get a reasonable amount of workout in . Does it cost the same for just two nights or , No , it 's less expensive . Well , that 's good , too . This one was only forty-five dollars . But I 'm glad it 's not too totally cheap , because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more , probably . Yeah , yeah . Since it 's more expensive , I think , Okay , you spent that much money , you 'd better go . That 's right , that 's right . So hopefully . Yeah , yeah , it 's right there , and it 's , they have a really nice facility at the T I . They 've got two different aerobics rooms , they have the mirrors . Of course , sometimes you do n't like to see the mirrors on the wall -- -- you do n't like to see how you work . But , I guess , sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going . But , Yeah , and then they hire private instructors ? Uh-huh . Oh , that 's great . And they have ceiling fans in the rooms , and it 's , it 's a pretty nice setup . Um , and of course it 's real convenient , because it is right there at work . I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere , I 'd never make it . Yeah . And just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the , the recreation center and do it helps a lot . Uh-huh . Yeah , I can see that would be , uh , easy . They make it as easy as they possibly can for you . Oh , yeah . Well , um , do a lot of people take advantage of it ? Quite a few do . They have probably , ooh , I 'd say fifteen different , fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running , and they have them anywhere from six in the morning . Uh , they have some during , during lunch hour that are shorter , and I guess guys can take advantage of that . For me , I would n't have time to do an hour , hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get , get dressed again . Oh , yeah . But there 's a lot more guys that do that one . Uh-huh . And , um , they have them , you know , in the evenings , they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that . So they have big variety . They even have some , uh , aerobic , uh , water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool . I 've never done that one before . But . Oh , you have a pool there , too ? Uh-huh . Oh , how nice . They 've got an olympic pool , and , and basketball courts and sand volleyball . They 've got the full weight room and , uh , the locker rooms with , uh , a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities , and hair dryers , and all the , you know , everything you 'd need just about . Wow . It 's a real , it is a real nice facility . It 's also got a full insid , inside basketball court , and I think they 're working on building a jogging track and some other things . But it 's , it is very nice . That 's great . I just do n't take as much advantage of it as I should . Now to use , I mean , I 'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing . But . Well , does it cost money like to use the , to exercise in the weight room or to , uh , to tak , to go swimming . Do you have to pay for that , too . Yeah . You can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities , and it 's about eight dollars a month . Oh , that 's not bad . No , not at all . Huh-uh . Pretty cheap . Um . And then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership , but , I think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced , from what I 've heard . I think so too , yeah . Well , and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics ? Hm ? People of all ages take advantage of the aerobics ? Oh , yeah , in fact , uh , the T I-er 's families can come in on these things ,
