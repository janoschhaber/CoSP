All right , well . Um , short term , I do n't think anything 's going to be done about it -- Right . -- or probably should be done about it . Uh , are you saying you do n't think anything should be done in the short term ? Uh , the short term , the recession is getting , getting top attention . Yeah , I , I think that you 're absolutely right there . 

The other thing is , is that we 've got these , um , these , all these bank defaults going on , and , and savings and loan defaults , and , and , uh , uh , And that effectively adds to whether it 's officially on the books or not . Right . Exactly . Um , And that 's got to be paid . Exactly , and , and , uh , so this creates a pretty serious problem that 's going to continue to be with us for a while to come . Um , I 'm not really , uh , sure that I even understand why the administration is proposing , for instance , tax reductions , because it seems to me that if , if , if they 're talking about reducing , uh , the tax that needs to be paid , or the tax that 's currently being paid , then that ca n't , it seems to me it ca n't possibly , you know , help with the , the deficit picture . It can only hurt the deficit picture . Yeah , exactly . 

Um , and the , the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without , uh , bringing on , on serious problems for the longer term . Yeah , exactly . So that , that , that 's the current predicament . Yeah , it see , seems like it 's , it 's a kind of a Catch Twenty-two . I mean , it 's , it 's the , um , my understanding is what they 're try , what , what supposedly they 're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy , the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes , they 'll have more money to spend , uh , and if they have more money to spend , then that will be a spur to productivity , particularly commercial productivity , uh , which in turn will generate revenue . But it , it seems like , like , uh , it 's sort of a , uh , a sp- , an unending spiral , and it , it , it , uh , I 'm , I 'm not sure that there 's any real genuine truth to the , uh , the idea that , that , uh , that decreasing taxes , particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to , uh , result in substantial amounts of money , you know , for consumers to spend . 

And , uh , Yeah , I 'm not sure how I feel about paying on the quest , the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point . It 's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is . Yeah , it , uh , it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do . Well , well , first of all you look to the Fed to fight the recession -- Uh-huh . 

-- as indeed it has , with interest rates . Uh-huh . I think that 's been a positive development . I think what that 's done is it 's , it 's , it 's help keep inflation from , um , uh , Well , at the moment we 're doing very well on inflation . Yeah , exactly . That 's the sort of upside to the deficit . It 's a sort of a piece of luck . That 's the upside to the recession . Yeah , um . I do n't know , 

what kind of things do you think can be done in , in , uh , in the long term ? MUMBLEx Well , can be done or will be done are two different things . Um , at various places to look for , for cutting the budget , first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned -- Sure . -- depending on the world situation . But there are various other areas such as , as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed . Uh , a lot of entitlement programs , like education aid , I think , uh , they should put a , in 

the Reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor -- Uh-huh . -- but left them for the middle class , uh , in the longer term , uh , we , we , we 'd do well , I think to make , to make , uh , reductions there . Also somewhat MUMBLEx is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed . Right . I think that , I think that , that I agree with you certainly in the second situation , and I think certain entitlements I , I 'm inclined to agree with you , too . Education happens to be one place where I think that we would foolish to um , uh , A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools -- Uh-huh . -- which are sort of not colleges but schools that teach you trades , you know , beautician -- Oh , I see , I see what you 're saying . -- well , and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition , uh , and the school gets paid off immediately , uh -- And then they -- -- and then they do n't provide very much education . -- and then the people default -- Yes . -- on the loans . Well , I would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that , uh , around , uh , and I , I , I ca n't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing , but , but taking what you 're saying at face value , then I would have to agree with completely . 

Yeah .
