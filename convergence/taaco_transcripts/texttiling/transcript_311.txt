-ing seems to be a , a topic that 's going to probably take about a generation to , uh , catch on , it seems , or maybe a generation to two . And we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up . Uh , it does seem to be a lot of habits to break . I , uh , was n't raised as a kid on it , but my kids are and so they , they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do , and we were doing all right there until , uh , the price dropped out 

and they were n't worth anything anymore . Uh-huh . And we , it took us , almost a year to get a garbage sack full . We just do n't drink that many . So as far as at home use , uh , we 'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something and , and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in , uh , at the time it was still , oh , about forty or fifty cents a pound , and we came out with about a dollar , 

it just really was n't worth it . And a lot of hassle all year round and cans laying , Yeah . Yeah . So , they , they realized , you know , well , of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old . That was n't , uh , that was a big deal , but we decided it was n't worth us keeping it and then , uh , T I started keeping up with , uh , cans there , so occasionally I 'll bring whatever I 've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there . Least it gets back into the system , but , as far as a habit at the house , uh , I have n't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up . 

Have you all got the individual containers yet ? No , I read in the paper this week where maybe , I do n't know if it w , was , 

I guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time . Um . But , it , it should be starting , I would stay probably in the next month if , if everything goes that , I 'm not sure all what we 're going to have to do , whether we have three separate containers , I really do n't understand that part on what they 've told you to separate everything . Right . Yeah , it seemed like , uh , if , if I recall , it 's been a long time . They 're way behind schedule on that particular part of it . They were fine on the green , big green containers -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , seems like they said they were just going to have a bin and all different types would go in there 

and then that they would sort it as -- Oh . -- as needed . It , it seemed that there was , at the time anyway , it , the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at , at the collection sites where everything 's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it , happen to do it pretty well , uh , those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting . But when it comes down to just general purpose trash , that all the houses , uh , the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor , 

so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than , than -- Uh-huh . -- having a household try it . But I , I do n't know , 

that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week 's worth of trash for a house . Well , it would get messy , too . Yeah , yeah , I , I , I know other places when they recycle , they have to , like , wash out their glass jars and -- Right . -- whatnot . And , uh , which we 're not in the habit of doing . That 's true . I was brought up , uh , you know , long time ago , that they did n't even have cans . They had bottles and you 'd return them to the -- Right . -- the grocery store and you 'd get our money back and that , that was all well and good . They do n't seem to still be doing that . If they could just eliminate the cans and use glass , 

but , I guess this day and age -- Yeah . -- they do n't . They do n't do that . We live next to a set of railroad tracks 

and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there , by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash , you know -- Uh-huh . -- break them , but , uh , they were n't that successful , so there were a lot of bottles to be returned and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted -- Uh-huh . -- for the day and , Yeah , and they , uh , p- , I , I think kids do n't appreciate , maybe the value of money , that it 's so little that they do n't care , they can get more somewhere else . Yeah , just a little bit of begging will , Uh , for a good , right . They 're , the nickels , the dimes or what , I suppose it might be quarters , fifty cent pieces in these days , that they would get , they , the kids just do n't seem to , to care that , that much about a small amount of money . Right . Well , I wonder , But , we , we did buy a can crusher and we are crushing cans and when we buy the soda when it 's on sale for ninety-nine cents , so I would say -- Yeah . -- in the last three years , we 've probably used a lot more cans than ever before . Uh , it was just easier to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat . Right , yeah . So that 's the main reason we 're , we , sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles . Where do you take your cans ? Well , as you say , it takes a while to build it up . Since we 've had the crusher all summer , we , I guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we have n't ta- , oh , 

I think the kids , when we were on vacation , they said they did take them to a , a recycling place , probably at one of the li- ,
