Well I have n't had too much of a chance to watch T V lately . Yeah . So probably everything I going to say is kind of dated . Well , I can understand that . It 's that time of the year . Yeah . We just , my wife and I just recently moved into our house . So we 're -- Oh . -- spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things . But . Yeah . Um , like to keep up to date too . Uh-huh . I guess , in the , since I got out of college , which was about five years ago , my T V viewing started to tend more towards , uh , documentary , news programs , things like that . Uh-huh . Something that 's going to keep mu up to date . 

I 've kind of , kind of gotten away from , uh , being a series watcher , having to keep up to date with , uh , Oh , yeah . I think when you 're in college you kind of , you have more of a regular schedule -- Uh-huh . -- in terms of , you can watch every week . Yeah , that makes a big difference . So , yeah , I , I used to , when my kids were real little and I was home , I watched , where I was home where I watched things on a more regular basis . 

But right now , the last things I watched regularly was THIRTY SOMETHING when it first came out . Okay . Did you all ever watch that ? I , yeah , I started , too , and , uh -- Yeah . -- kind of , kind of worked away from that . Yeah . 

I , I have a hard time sticking with something -- Yeah . -- like , like on T V , because , it , like , it gets real aggravating if you miss it , for a week or two . You feel kind of left out . Right , right . But , um , right . I know , but I tell you what , um , we 're really strict with our kids about television , and one night , couple weeks ago , it was just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch , and we said okay , well we 'll sit down and we 'll , you know , look at what you want to see . Let 's just turn it on and see what 's on . We could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it . I believe that . So , you know , it was prime time , 

it was , what , seven thirty , eight o'clock on a week night -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- and we have cable , and there was n't anything on any channel , and the stuff that was on the prime , the networks , you know , A B C , N B C , C B S , was , it was just , um , dribble -- Yeah . -- you know , I mean , it was n't even funny -- That 's right . -- it was n't creative , it , it was the worst I 've seen . I mean , I have not watched prime time , week night T V , I guess in a real long time -- Yeah . -- because I was shocked . I know exactly how you feel . You know what I 'm saying . That 's right . I , uh , when I first moved down here , moved into the apartment and got cable , and I guess I sort of , kind of became numb . Uh-huh . Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V , you know . And then all of a sudden , I started paying , paying attention to network T V again , once in a while . Right . Right now we do n't have cable . Right . And it 's surprising how much it 's changed -- Uh-huh . -- the whole moral situation , everything , is just gone one whole complete direction different . And we do n't have any kids yet , but I feel the same way . It 's really tough to find something that 's -- Right . -- going to be good and interesting for the kids . Even , even cartoons , um -- Oh . -- you know , you watch some of the cartoons , and kids -- Yeah . -- are n't , are n't even going to understand half the humor that 's in there . It 's , none of it 's probably damaging , lot of times . Right , it 's just , it 's just , uh , like a necessary evil . I mean , when we , when our children were younger , when they were like four years old , three years old , five years old , we just had Sesame Street and that was about it , you know . Right , right . But now , in order to seem , you know , humane and normal , we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff . Oh , yeah , yeah . But it 's , just one of those things , you know , you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something , because those drive you crazy , if you 're , if you 're in the room . So , That 's right . But it 's such a shame , because it could be so good . I do n't understand why , first of all , the public puts up with it . Well , that 's true . Second of all , why the networks think that , you know , we enjoy that kind of stuff . It 's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that . That ca n't be the problem . Uh-huh . It must be the marketing pressures , and , you know , their demographic studies that they do that show , you know , that everybody 's I Q has dropped dramatically or something . I 'm glad you said it and I did n't have to . But that , that , that 's the , I feel the exact same way . I sit , I sit and watch some shows , and I 'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show . I know . You know , why do you do this to yourself ? Why do you do this ? Yeah . I know , I 'm trying to think if there 's anything I do , you , like , uh , I like stuff that 's on Great Performances , and , I , we used to watch mystery quite a bit -- Okay . -- and things like that . Stuff I guess that mostly public , on public T V . Right . As a matter of fact , you know when I was a kid , excuse me , my parents used to have , we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular T V that we watched , we had to watch an hour of public T V . Now there 's an idea . That was just the rule . And if they saw us watching the , something , they 'd say , all right , what did you see on WHAT 'S NEW , or there was some other , the children 's program I think at the time was called WHAT 'S NEW . Okay , yeah . So we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program . Yeah , yeah . That 's pretty good . Do you , do you watch sports on T V ? Are you a sports fan ? I ca n't handle it very long . Yeah . I , I mean , I 'm , I 'm a sports fan , but it 's , well , it 's kind of , it 's kind of like reading magazines any more . If half of the time was n't spent watching commercials , it probably would n't be so bad . Right , yeah . But , uh , it , it 's , you 're missing an awful lot . Yeah . I 'd rather , personally rather watch , see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium . but uh , Yeah , that 's true , the traffic . But , uh , no , Uh . I do n't sit down , I 'll sit down for the big games , the Super Bowl , and the championship -- Yeah . -- you know , things like that . But I do n't follow any team . Uh-huh . I check the scores the next morning , and I know how everybody 's doing , and that suffices me . But , Yeah . I like , I like good comedy , good humor once in a while . Yeah , I , I enjoy that , but what do you , where do you -- -- do you get that come- . You do n't have cable now , I was going to say they have a comedy channel now . But again you 're in a situation where you 're watching mostly , uh , commercials , and then -- -- you 're , you know , trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up . You know what I did . There was a time there where I could tape things and then I 'd fast forward through the -- Uh-huh . -- commercials . Saved a lot of time that way . Yeah , it works , you bet , yeah . But , that takes too much planning . Yeah , no , I do n't know , if there 's any , any series that I pay attention to , I try to watch CHEERS once in a while . Now that , yeah , is that still real good . It used to be real good . But . Yeah , it is . Is it . In fact , it 's , I think it 's on tonight . Oh . I just got in from outside , so I -- Oh , okay . -- so I 'm kind of out of it . Things like that , and I consider that fairly intelligent humor . Yeah . You know . Yeah . You can tell , they pick up the words every once in a while . Right , right . Is n't it such a long running program . Yeah . Yeah , they do have a good , they do have good writers for that . Oh , that makes me think , do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE at all ? I try to . Yeah , we try to stay up , too . Yeah . It 's getting harder and harder . Ten years ago was n't so hard to stay up . Yeah , you know , it was , it was just automatic , too , no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it . I think it 's come around again . It 's gone through cycles . Yeah , it was , we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there , but we started watching again . Uh-huh . But it 's real different show than it was when it started . Yeah . It 's funny now , and it 's better , but it 's real different -- That 's right . -- than what it used to be . That 's right . But you ca n't be so , ca n't be outrageous . Right . You know , if you keep that same format . There 's only so long that you can be outrageous . So , Yeah , that 's for sure , that is for sure . Well , I guess there are a few things around still but , Yeah , but you have to hunt hard for them . Sounds like you pretty much agree . Yeah , I guess so . Well . Well . Been , uh , good talking to you . Yeah , good talking to you . Okay . Take care . You too . Bye . Bye .
