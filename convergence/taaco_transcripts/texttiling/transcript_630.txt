I guess , I guess by what you said you 're , you do n't feel your , uh , privacy has been inva , invaded anytime recently ? No , not really . Uh , u- , th- , uh , th- , the only thing that annoys me is when , uh , people call and they , uh , you have solicitation calls . Uh-huh . That 's the only thing that bothers me . That 's not really invading my privacy . 

Right . Uh , do you feel that yours is invaded ? Uh , no I would n't call it invading my privacy by any means . Uh , you know , I would , there , there 's a lot of times though , uh , you get those calls and , you know , when you 're sitting at home wanting to relax or , or whatnot and , you know , next thing you know , uh , someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it 's real hard to , to tell them , you know , that you 're not interested . Or you do tell them you 're not interested and they still keep asking you , you know , and keep badgering you about it , and that aggravates me . But I do n't know that you could call that invading of , invading my privacy 

because , you know , if we do n't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say , look , you know , I want my name unlisted or want my , you know , But , but that does n't work . It does n't ? Uh , no , because they , a lot of times they dial sequentially . 

They get your name from , uh , if you enter any type of contest or anything . Uh-huh . Uh , you know , you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something , you put your phone number on there , they pass your phone number on to another company . Oh . Uh , or you , uh , or , or like the newspapers , they just dial randomly or s- , and stuff . They even call , the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe . And , uh , while I was subscribing to the paper , I got so upset at them that they -- Uh-huh . -- you call me one more time , I 'm going to stop subscribing . And the lo , local , local papers MUMBLEx ask them to remove your na- , number from their list and , uh , yeah , you call up their regular , during regular hours their , uh , they have a special department , they 'll take your numbers out of their lists . 

Uh-huh . Uh , but the , uh , Orlando paper , uh , yeah , they , they refused to take it off of the lists and they call every month . Huh . And when you have more than one phone number , you get a call on each number you have . Good grief . Well , let me ask you about this . Here 's something that , uh , has been kind of concerning me lately . My fiance received a bill from a , a Lord and Taylor company , Uh , you know , they 're a , they 're a department store . Uh-huh . She received a bill from them , uh , that she had visited some sto- , and , and I think it was there in Florida , maybe it was in Miami . That , uh , she had visited a store there and , uh , they had this bill , uh , that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise , uh , over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise . Uh-huh . Uh , and the date that , that she supposedly made this purchase , she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving . Uh-huh . Uh , and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number . Uh-huh . Uh , and , and I 've , I 've heard recently that , uh , uh , that this is a common occurrence where people are using s- , you know , they use Joe Blow 's so , uh , social security number , uh , and can , uh , potentially ruin someone 's credit . Uh-huh . If you know a person 's social security number and their mailing address , i- , and their mother 's maiden name , uh , you can , basically , become that , uh , person . Huh . Uh , if the purchase was made mail order , they should have a record of where it was shipped to -- Uh-huh . -- and since it was n't shipped to her address , she could prove , you know , that it was n't her . Uh , if it was some you know , coming into the store and stuff , then she would ha , whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of , uh , you know , document -- Yeah . -- and , uh , wh- , the signature , uh , they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they ca n't provide a signature , you know , they 'll have to eat the charge . Yeah . Well , y- , But if the pers- , has , you know , their social s- , her social security number , I 'd be real concerned that they , uh , that she 's not , uh , blacklist on , uh , Tel- , what is it , it 's Telecredit or something ? Yeah . Uh , because she wo n't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there . She probably wo n't be ab , able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle . Yeah . Well , we got it cleared up eventually . What happened , uh ,
