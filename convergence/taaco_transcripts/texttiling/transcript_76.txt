All right . Well , like I told you before , MUMBLEx . And you 're talking about credit cards . Uh-huh . We put ours up . I mean I had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up . Um , I wish I had . Well , you should try it . Well , I , it was done for me after a while . I had a , uh , I had a business going . And this was back in the eighties . I do n't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that . But , uh , I had a coin shop , and everything was going great while gold and silver was up , 

and it started falling . Yeah . So I started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards , and things got worse and worse , and finally , boom . You lost your business ? Yep . Oh , gol . What a nightmare . Yeah , it was . I ended up going into bank- , you know , it was one of those things uh , Oh , it 'll get better next week , you know . Things will pick up . And , so , there I was in old bankruptcy court . Well , you were n't charging gold and silver were you ? You ca n't do that , can you ? 

Oh , yeah . Oh , you can ? Oh , yeah , yeah . I was buying from other dealers , and , uh , you know , they take payment any way they can get it . Oh , that 's a nightmare . Yeah . Course on , on stuff that I was , on merchandise that I was buying on cards , it was , I was getting the money back , because I was selling it . I was n't buying , you know , just to hold onto it . 

Uh , but it was things like , you know , rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up . Uh-huh . So . Well , I remember before I got married , you know when you graduate from college they 'll send you all those -- Uh-huh . -- credit card applications -- Uh-huh . -- you know , of course you fill them all out because you 're honored . Sure . And , uh , I had stuff for like Sanger Harris , and , you know , it got up like to couple of hundred dollars , 

and I thought , Well that 's okay , cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month . Uh-huh . Right . Yeah . I was n't thinking a thing about it . That 's the way they suck you in . Yeah . I was just stupid , and every time they had a sale , there I was . Uh-huh . 

Because , you know , got , get such good bargains . Uh-huh . And I do n't know . Well , just today in the mail I got , uh , I got , got my guaranteed acceptance by , uh , American Express . Oh , yeah , we 've been getting those . Yeah . I went back to school and got my Master 's , and they started sending those things to me again . Yeah , as soon as you 're a graduate student they get your name . Yeah , they did . And , uh , course , I guess , I guess I 've been purged from their records . I used to have an American Express . 

Uh , back when I had my business I got one . Uh-huh . And they , they goofed up bad on my fir , on my very first bill , 

because I was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses . Yeah . And the bill would come in , and I 'd pay it . And the very first bill , I paid it , and then I got this nasty letter from them saying , You 're overdue , pay . So I said , Well , it just crossed in the mail . So I did n't do anything about it . Two weeks later I get another letter , even nastier , and said , We 're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you do n't pay . And I looked at that , and I said , Uh-huh . So by this time my checks had come back from the bank . So I made a copy of the check that they had cashed -- Um . 

-- attached it to their letter , and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces , saying Thanks , but no thanks . Turned out they were n't cheeky . Yeah , they were , I tell you . They do n't talk about they 're charging that enormous fee every year . So what is it now ? It 's up to fifty-five on the gold card . It 's eighty-five for the Optima . Or , I 'm sorry no , fif- , no 

fif- , What do you mean fifty-five ? You mean fifty-five dollars ? Yeah , for the green card . But then , what 's the interest ? Well , now , that 's the card , see . And interest is like eighteen or something . Oh , yeah , yeah . It 's , um , well , of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in , so there is n't any . But on the Optima card it 's , um , let 's see , right now it 's running at about . It 's not too bad . It 's actually , it 's about sixteen and a half percent , which is pretty good , as far as credit cards go . Yeah . Well , credit cards . Well , they 're dangerous . You know , my parents do n't hardly use them . Huh-uh . Mine do n't either , mine do n't either . They , uh , my mom has a , uh , has a MasterCard and a Visa card , 

and that 's it . I 've got all my gas cards , because I do n't want to carry money around . Yeah . I 'll do that . Yeah , now I , I do use gas cards . Now Impact is kind of bad too , though . Yeah , 

You know . Especially if you get , forget to record those little suckers . Yeah , exactly . Plastic is just too easy , I mean -- Uh-huh . -- that 's the , that 's the whole problem with it . Um , Well , and you 're tempted if you 've got cash , a little bit of cash , and you do n't have enough for the purchase , right . Yeah . Of course , you got to charge it and keep your cash . Sure , naturally . That 's , I got into all kinds of trouble doing that . What are you saying ? Oh , my husband says I might buy it , but I , I do n't really usually consider that an option . Maybe that 's how we got in trouble . Having , having been out of the credit game for some years now , I 've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it . And , uh , Yeah , but it 's hard , is n't it ? Well , it is , but , I , I , I 'm kind of , uh , grateful for the experience because it 's taught me a lot of restraint . Well , it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic . Yeah , exactly . I , I , uh , I just went out and got a new V C R yesterday with cash . With cash ? And , it , it 's , Do you work with T I ? No . No , I wish I did . Yeah , you could have got a discount , could n't you ? Yeah , I could use a discount . I have to wait for things to go on sale . But there 's always a sale . Yeah , especially on electronic goods -- Yeah . -- especially now . What is that thing I saw , Circuit , Circuit World or something . Circuit City . Circuit City . Have you been in there ? Yeah , they , they 're not , their prices are n't that terrific . They , they used to be , but they 've gotten , they 've got to pay for all that national advertising now . Oh , it 's national ? Uh-huh . I think I 've seen two around Dallas . Yeah , they 're , they 're all over the country now . Well , what else , They , they used to be good . I remember when they first opened up . They did have good bargains . I do n't know if you have a place there called , uh , or you probably have something similar . We call it Service Merchandise . Yeah , in Garland . You got Service Merchandise . Uh-huh . Yeah , it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go . And , uh , Circuit City came along and that was the place to go to get your T V -s and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that . And then after the years went by , they just sort of kept creeping up on price , and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now . So . So . So much for Circuit City . So . Okay , what else can we talk about ? Who do you work for ? I do n't , I 'm a graduate student . I 'm a professional student . Sounds wonderful . It is . We were talking about that just today . It 's great . We could be just lifelong students . It is great . I love it . Where are you going to school ? N C State . What 's that ? Uh , North Carolina State . So you 're on Spring Break ? Not yet . Ours do n't , ours does n't start until , uh , next week . So where are you ? Where am I ? Yeah . What do you mean , where ? Oh , in Raleigh . Oh , okay . Little , the burgeoning metropolis of Raleigh . What a dead place . Is it ? . Yeah . I 've got a nice little business at home , and I sit around and tinker with that most of the time . So what are you getting your degree in ? Um , uh , human factors . And what do you do with it ? Not a thing . Well , what is it ? It 's , it 's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them . So it 's sociology . It 's , well , it 's more psychology and engineering . Uh , my , my master 's is in industrial engineering . So you 're working on your doctorate ? Yeah . Oh lord . P H D in human factors . Oh , that will , that will sound wonderful , wo n't it ? Well , Get you a little MUMBLEx plaque . Oh , yeah . I B M , uh , I mean , uh , a lot of people use human factors , folks , but I B M is what I 'm looking at right now . Are n't , are n't they laying off several thousand people ? They might be , but not at , not at the human factors level . They , they 're , Well , I heard it on the news today , I could swear it was I B M . No , as a matter of fact , the I B M right here , or in Carey , which is a little suburb of Raleigh , just , just hired one more human factors person . Um . Doggone it , if they 'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been How much longer do you have ? I 'm , I 'm , I 'm going into thes- , or going into the , uh , dissertation this summer . And get that done this summer ? Uh , I 'm going to start this summer . I probably wo n't finish it until the end of the year -- Ooh . -- but , uh , I 'm , I 'm trying to get a , uh , intern position with I B M right now so that I can find an area to do my dissertation in . Because you , It 's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field . Why ? There has been so much work done already ? Yeah , that 's , that and , and , it 's , it 's limited application in some respects . Um , conside- , in the area that we 're in here , there 's a lot of places that use human factors people . Most ,
