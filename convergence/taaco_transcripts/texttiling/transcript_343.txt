Okay . Where do you enjoy dining out ? Oh , I generally go to the quickie places just because they 're cheap . Yes , do you have children ? Uh , we have four , but most of them are gone now -- Uh . -- so there , there might be , but we were taking , you know , uh , four , five and six people out . Yeah , that makes a difference , does n't it . Yes . What area of the country do you live in ? I 'm in Texas . Yes , I am , too . But , 

And we live , we lived in Ohio prior to this . I did , too . I 'm from the Dayton area . Oh . Yeah , uh , but I look for service even at the quickie places -- Uh-huh . -- type things . Uh , I do n't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong -- That 's right . -- and then you 're stuck and it 's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave -- Yes . -- so I really do n't like the drive-thrus that much . I , I like to go and eat there . But I would say service , uh , atmosphere , and whether the food is good , and on going out , I like steaks . 

So , we try to hit those places when we can . When we travel we look for Wendy 's because we have kids , and my husband and I like getting the salads or the lighter meals -- Uh-huh . -- and then that way they can get their burgers and fries 

and we can have a salad bar -- Yeah . -- so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy 's , because it 's all either McDonald 's or Dairy Queens , and , in , in , in the countries , unless it 's a large city , I guess Dairy Queen and Wal-Mart are their main . Right , that 's right , That 's what you find , right , I know . My husband likes , uh , Dairy Queens . 

He likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese -- Uh-huh . -- dogs , I guess , so he 's a fan of , of Dairy Queen , and , and we 'll go even in town here at times , just as a , a change although -- Uh-huh . -- I 'm not that excited about it . But we 've eat , we eat out so much it 's gotten so I do n't like to really eat any place 

but yet I hate to cook food at home -- Oh . -- so that might be why I look for inexpensive places -- Uh-huh . -- just because we 're eating out probably five nights a week -- Um . -- maybe . Or we eat junk food at home -- Yeah . -- uh , now my husba- , Well , what are some of your , your favorite inexpensive places ? Oh , we 'll go to them all . We sort of take turns . And we , uh I sort of favor the ones , if I have a coupon we can go there 

and if not we ca n't , because it 's cheaper -- Uh-huh . -- so mine is , monetarily , I guess strongly monetarily based . Uh , we 'll go get pizza and , uh , at Little Caesar 's , although the kids prefer Domino 's . Oh , we are Little Caesar fans here -- Right . -- that 's where we always go , But it 's just a lot cheaper than , than Domino 's , so that 's . 

We go to Grandy 's quite a bit I would say . Yes , we like Grandy 's , too . McDonald 's , uh , we 've sort of been off of that for a while and no particular reason , and I , maybe we avoided Wendy 's the last few years because our daughter worked there 

and she never wanted us to show up there -- Oh . -- so , I do n't , we do n't go there that much . Where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out , or a big meal ? A nice meal , oh , Where do you go for steaks ? It 's usually when we 're out of town -- Oh . -- and I 'll order steak or steak and lobster combined -- Uh-huh . 

-- so it 's really not in town . Oh . You ever been to Houston 's on Belt Line ? No . That 's where we go to get steaks -- Uh-huh . -- they have a teriyaki steak there , and when we have something to celebrate , we head to Houston 's . They do n't take reservations , and you wind up waiting about an hour -- Uh-huh . -- but the food is good , and they 've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink , unless you get there at five o'clock , 

then you can go right through . Right . But they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks , so , that 's our nice place to go . We do n't usually take the kids when we go there , But well , we do n't go out that much , I gue , well , I guess we do go out without kids . We 're usually picking things up quickly , though -- Yeah . -- we just do n't dwell on food too much , and , uh , with my husband traveling he can get all he needs -- Right , -- of that during the week going to those places -- That 's right . -- so , it does n't really matter to him . He 'd probably just like to stay home . Yeah , that 's the way with my husband . He 's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends , and I 've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere , so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend . Well , I think , I , I never have liked to cook food , but I think it all began eating out when we had , uh , the boys in , in different , uh , baseball -- Right . -- on baseball tea- , it was mainly baseball teams -- Yes . -- and my husband would coach , so we were never home at the same time . Uh-huh . I 'm not one that 's going to fix , you know , the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever -- Right . -- they 're there . or you go you know -- Yep . -- you fend for yourself . You go somewhere else .
