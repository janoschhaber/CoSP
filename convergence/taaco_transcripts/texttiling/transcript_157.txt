Okay . All right . What , uh , what kind of camping is there in Texas ? Well , there , there are quite a few , um , parks , I guess , state parks , and there 's a couple of national parks , I guess , that you can camp at . Uh-huh . Um , most of them have pretty good facilities . 

I do n't know if the camping that I 've done is really roughing it without a , a whole lot of stuff . Yeah . So , you do , uh , like backpacking and the like ? Uh , done a little bit of that , mainly just , um , like camping out at the state parks , I 've been to a couple in Texas and there 's some real nice ones in Arkansas . Uh-huh . Um , I think Arkansas has one of the best parks departments around . Huh . Is the Ozarks in Arkansas ? Uh-huh . Yeah , part of them are . Yeah , 

so , that 's probably a pretty nice place to go . Yeah , they 've got , uh , real nice lake system , and , around their parks . One of them , uh , the gray , I think that 's one of the ones we 've been to , it 's real nice there , a bunch of lakes around it , there 's a golf course and , um , just a whole bunch of camping sites . Yeah . What about you , where have you , uh , Oh , I 've been camping for years , not on a regular basis 

but , uh , I first started camping out in the desert in California . Uh-huh . And then sometimes in the mountains also in California and , uh , then I moved to North Carolina and I , I did n't camp for a long time , and then I started to , uh , go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting , 

so , I 'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting . Uh-huh . And then maybe camp another night and drive home . And that was , uh , that was pretty good so , I went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear and , uh , you know , I still do it once in a while . Yeah , I think we 've collected stuff off and on over the years . 

The more times we did it , the more serious we get about it . Uh-huh . Yeah . Where , where is Raleigh , in North Carolina ? Uh , well , it 's , it 's , uh , in terms of north , south I would say it 's , uh , a little , a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it . Okay . So what i- , Are you kind of away from the Blue Ridge Mountains , Well , it , an area . it 's , uh , actually the , the Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh . 

They 're about three hours away if you go due north . Uh-huh . Um , of the Blue Ridge in North Carolina I think are much nicer and you can pick those up going west , but then you 're talking about six to eight hours . Yeah . The way it works . But , um , it 's a real , it 's a real nice place to go and camp , and there 's some pretty decent campgrounds although , I do n't think Raleigh , I do n't think the state of North Carolina takes , they probably just do n't spend as much money as a lot of other states might . Uh-huh . Yeah , my wife 's from the western part of Virginia , we 've been down the parkway a lot , 

but I did n't know how much , how much camping areas there were along there . I think there 's quite a few . I ca n't say I 've checked them all out though . What , what 's it like camping in the desert and California , that seems , It 's , uh , like a challenge . it 's actually kind of incredible , it 's really , really nice . Um , I like it better than almost anything I 've ever done . Just the sky is so amazing . 

You know , you really can probably count thousands of stars , Uh-huh . and , uh , it 's , it 's just kind of nice . I like the , uh , I think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which , uh , a lot of people do n't realize , you know , they hear desert and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry , and lack of water , course it , it has all of those qualities 

but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just do n't find anyway else except in a desert . Uh-huh . So , it 's pretty nice . The , uh , the movie , THE DOORS , has so- , some nice desert scenes , those guys all go camping out in the desert . Yeah . Of course , they drag a lot of drugs with them but , um , the , uh , the shots are , are pretty nice and it 's sort of like that , 

I mean , it 's just almost surreal , in some places . Huh . It 's very pleasant . Are the temperatures real extreme there or the , the , They can be , yeah . I mean , you got to , you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what 's going to happen . Uh-huh . I 've been camping in Death Valley , one does n't go in July . Yeah , true . 

But it 's beautiful in February . Yeah . I mean , it 's just beautiful . The days , get up into the high eighties , uh , maybe the nineties but it 's , it 's quite bearable and then the nights are reasonably warm , you know , sixties or seventies . It 's just great . It 's really very nice . Yeah , we 've talked about planning a trip up through , um , I have a sister-in-law that lives in New Mexico , up through New Mexico and into Colorado and the Grand Canyon area . I do n't know , do n't know when I 'm going to get a chance to do that but , Yeah . Well , that would be , that would be pretty nice . I 've been , I have been camping on the south rim the Grand Canyon . That 's okay . A lot of people like to go down and camp down inside , I was just too lazy that trip to do all that walking , Uh-huh . especially with my gear . I 'll bet . That one , one thing you said about the stars is really true it 's , when you 're close to a big city like Dallas , the , the lights kind of wash , Oh , yeah . wash off the star so it 's nice to , to get away . It 's just amazing , Yeah , it , how , how much you miss . Yeah , it , yeah , it really is . I mean , I do n't think I ever see the Little Dipper , you hear people talk about the Little Dipper . Huh . Uh-huh . But I do n't think I ever see it except when I go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in , in the mountains . Otherwise it 's just too faint . Well , I guess we 've talked as much as we need to on the subject . Yeah , I think we fulfilled our obligation . Well , thanks for calling , nice talking to you . Yeah , it was good talking to you Robert . Okay , bye-bye . 

Bye-bye .
