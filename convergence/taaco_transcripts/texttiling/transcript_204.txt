Anyway , what are your , what are your first comments on that subject ? Uh , my first comments on the budget . I would say there has , What would you start cutting f- , what would be the first thing you 'd cut ? Defense ? Surprisingly , no . I would , I would cut the prison systems and let them self-support . Mean private enterprise ? Huh ? Have private enter- , enterprise do it ? 

You mean the prisons ? Uh-huh . They 're already talking about it . I mean , they 're talking about , uh , having it , uh , as a , you know , business . Uh , to , uh , you know , to , so , the , you know , the government does n't have to deal with it . I had n't heard that . But , uh , yeah , because I think it 's all funded , either state or federally funded 

so , Right . or , uh , obviously . So , but , uh , But to me it , But see they 're , they do n't have enough , uh , uh , you know , there 's , there 's not enough room in these prisons and that , and that , uh , to continue funding it . They think they need to , maybe have , uh , you know , private , you know , business , private enterprise come in . So , Well , see the other way I 'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting , like , uh , the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons . Anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves . In other words , they 're in there for a purpose , 

put them to work -- Uh-huh . -- rather than sitting there . It 's the same thing like the whole criminal , I should n't say criminal , but the whole police department of the United States . I feel the same way . Uh , someone gets picked up for drunk driving , 

he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there . Uh-huh . So it 's self defen- , you know , self-defense on that point . Uh , as far as my defense budget , uh , they 're cutting it back now , what , twenty-five percent ? 

I would n't want to see it cut any more than that . Yeah . But again I 'd like to see something on the other end back into education . But not in the education we have today . So I 'm lost on that one . I would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems . And to come up with something a little better than what we 've got . Uh-huh . Yeah , it 's tough to , to say what , uh , you know , what , uh , as far as this , that good or bad or what . But , uh , I was just talking to somebody else , and all those European countries , they pay all the way through college and stuff like that . They , 

so , uh , Well , not so much pay . I 'm not trying to see the government put out any more . No . Yeah , I know what you are saying . But I 'm just saying that even the differences , uh , is that , you know , some countries pay for students to go to , through college and etcetera . 

But here , it , you know , it 's just up to high school . Yeah . But see , we do n't even push the fact to the high school kids that there 's other means of education out there rather than college . To go either as an apprentice , which they , they do in other countries . Just doing it , which I think would bring the education back up . You know , Uh-huh . why not an apprentice out to a , a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or , you know , just a technician ? 

You can learn on the job . Uh-huh . Which , of course , again , which m , would mean , again , our education budget will go down if this is , in a few years , I mean it 's not going to be overnight . Yeah . But that would come down . I think the pro- , you know , that 's one reason , uh , you know , we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board . Uh , 

they 're not willing to , you know , to put that , you know , the training for only a certain amount . So , uh , it 's , you know , as far as the technical side . But , uh , even like one , one of the biggest things now is like paralegals and stuff . I mean they , they 're trying to get more people into that field . But they ca n't just bring somebody in without even having gone to , you know , school in that area before they can work , you know , for a lawyer as a paralegal . Excuse me . I see it being done . I know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and she 's training her . Uh-huh . Well , yeah , I , I 'm , well ya- , I , you know , I 'm assuming that it can be done . Uh , my perspective is that , you know , I 've been with a couple of big companies now . And it 's like they 'd , are unwilling to put the time in . You know , they want somebody , you know , when they then , when they bring them off , bring them in , that they have something , you know , a certain amount to contribute . Obviously , there 's , uh , you know , there 's a lot to learn , uh , after that . But , but , uh , that 's true . I 'm , I 'm sure there 's a lot of , uh , you know , businesses are small , you know , small businesses that could , uh . Let me change my channel , I 've got a cordless phone . Let me see if that clears this up . Is that better ? Yes . Okay . Wow ! MUMBLEx Yeah , it was a cordless phone , and all of a sudden we had a bad , uh , frequency there or something . So we had some interference , so I changed that . Yeah . It sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere . Anyway , so , uh , Well , but , uh , you know , I think , uh , they , maybe they need to , uh , help promote that more . Give incentives like , uh , if they do bring somebody on , they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is , you know , for them to train people , Uh-huh . you know , stuff like that . Programs like that , you know . I do n't know , you know , what kind of options they 've got . Well , that 's something about what Germany 's supposed to be doing . Something similar to that right now . And , uh , they have jobs out on , you know , bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields . But see , that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people . At people , per , at high school level , Uh-huh . which I would like to see . Rather than so many kids getting out of school . They 're , they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around . Uh-huh . Because they do n't have any education . I do n't mean college . And I 'm for college . But there 's a lot of people that do n't want their higher education as far as quote , quote college is concerned . They 've had it . Yeah . I think , I just heard something the other day , it was like only , it was either sixty percent or forty percent , go to college . And then out of that percentage , only so many can get their degree . Uh-huh . So , I thought that was interesting . But , uh , you know , most people I knew have gone and got their degree . So , Oh , yeah . But there 's a lot of them out there that have n't . Yeah . Well , I ju- , you know , I , That 's , uh , was basic , in a , you know , middle , upper middle class area , and yeah , so I think , uh , that demographic area there , you know , a lot of them do go on . And they go to college , etcetera . Because you can get just as far as being a journeyman , carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that . Make as much money and if they enjoy it more , they 'll make a lo- , happier life for themselves . Yeah . Question . You threw that question on me about the deficit , put it on your shoe now . What would you do ? Well , as as far as the , you know , the deficit , that 's a whole nother , uh , my perception of the budget , you know , the government . And they have so much to spend and there 's not enough money to spread around . But the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries , and that we have more money or goo , you know , more money going out and too many goods coming into this country , you know . And , uh , you know , part of that problem , I think , is still , you know , uh , like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country . And , and obviously the , the demand for their goods is quite high here , so they can get their goods in here . And , uh , you know , to start even that out we need to continue to , you know , at least threaten that , you know , we 're going to give them higher tariffs , etcetera to raise their prices to , you know , ours . But , uh , it 's just that , uh , they 're , eh , I think you 're , you 're going to find that just because the United States , you know , there is such a demand here , the market , you know . And , uh , uh , the mone- , you know , money being spent and the goods flow in and we do n't sell , you know , we do n't , uh , sell products abroad as much as we bring in . So , Were you watching , I think , uh , one of the news stations . I could n't even tell you which one I watched . But they had on there , where the , the output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting . Uh-huh .
