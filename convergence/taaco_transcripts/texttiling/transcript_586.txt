So , let 's talk about the , uh , wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact , the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it . What do you think ? 

Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there ? Well , actually , I do n't think they 're out of line . De- , Devil 's advocate possibly , but it , you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whe- , whether or not you agree with that law , i- , you 're still circumventing it . You are legal in , in your circumvention of that law . What , what if you 're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though ? I mean what if you do n't even realize that you 're subject to paying , uh , income tax on something that you purchase mail order ? Really , I , I , I do n't think that 's a valid argument . I think that most people are quite aware they 're not paying that six percent sales tax . Um , s- , s- , naturally some , some things you just ca n't find in your local K-Mart or , or , uh , Bryn Mawr stereo dealer . Uh , but th- , th- , th- , then why not pay , pay the sales tax MUMBLEx . Corporations have to , 

why should an individual just because it 's , just because the state ca n't really find out about it , be able to avoid paying sales tax ? Well , I mean , it seems to me that , generally , at least in my own experience , when I purchase something mail order , it 's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania . 

It 's because , I 'm sorry , the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . Yes . Uh , it 's because I , I ca n't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area . So I go outside the area for that . And I think that it 's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though , you know , the revenue stream went to another state . I do n't , I do n't think that that 's my responsibility as a , as a conscientious consumer . I , I 'll agree it , it 's not your responsibility but , b- , is it also legal , for you to do that ? W , w , fr- , from what I understand from v , v , various net readings , i- , i- , it , the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes , uh , in , into place in the next few years . It is , it is a lost revenue stream right now and states c , can use all the revenue they can get . With some , with something like that , d , do your arguments still apply ? Well , I think that if , if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion , then I do n't argue with it . Because it 's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh , I bought this out of state . I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania . Which is exactly what businesses do at the present . Right . But the point is is that businesses do that . The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question . That 's a cost of doing business . The burden -- And I , I -- -- should n't be placed on the consumer . -- I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having , having to pay sales tax on it . Uh . That 's my understanding of the way , uh , the way it works . Usually , the , the person ordering does n't pay . But the accounting department will , uh , suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay . And there r- , there are s- , some substantial , nasty penalties , um , if you , if businesses try to avoid that . Uh , do you mean businesses from the point of view as , of , of selling things to a consumer and -- I- , MUMBLEx . -- then being responsible for the sales tax ? No . Businesses , uh -- Or purchasing . -- if purchasing things mail order , if , if I 'm a computer consulting firm and I see these , this great deal on forty-six mother boards , uh , from , from say Utah . Um , I , I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax . My a- , accounting department will at the end of the month . I think that i- , i- , I think that 's the way things work in Pennsylvania . And I know they work that way in , uh , say here in D C . Yeah . See I 'm unfamiliar with that because I do n't , I never see that end of the business . Yeah . So , my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer . Uh , but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for policing themselves , then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity f- , to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided . That 's true . I- , i- , a r- , a big hole does exist right now , uh , in that consumers can just say oh , I , I forgot that . There , there is no well defined mechanism at all and , and that it is a a l- , loss . I , I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism ju- , just to do just that in or- , in order to gain the revenue that 's being lost . Uh , I mean , I , I do n't know if I agree with that . But it , but ,
