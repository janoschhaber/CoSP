All right . Well , uh , quite a few and they 're varied . They do n't , uh , uh , encompass , uh , many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing . Uh-huh . But , I do , uh , quite a bit of wreath making and my dogs are my hobbies . I do a lot of gardening . 

I go to estate sales , which takes up a lot of time . Uh-huh . Now , what do you mostly do ? Well , mostly right now I 'm a , I do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible . We 're , uh , we 're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff , Oh , so . boy . Yeah . That should be fun . Yeah . Fun for them . Yeah . How old are they ? Uh , I 've got a little girl who 's six and a little girl that 's three . 

Well , I think that 's better than having that party at home . Yeah . Well , uh , this is a friend 's party and they , they rented , or , you know , they , the party , they , uh , just rent skates and stuff for the kids . Yeah . So , uh -- And , -- they 're , the -- they 're looking forward to it . -- the , the skating rink does the rest practically , Yeah , I guess . yeah . Uh-huh . Boy , what a help that is . Yeah . So , uh , What kind of , how long have you lived in North Carolina ? Well , not that long . Really ? Uh , just since October . We moved here from Enid , Oklahoma . Oh . Uh-huh . So , uh , we are , we 're originally from Virginia , this part of the country . Uh-huh . But , we did spend twenty years in Norman and Enid -- Uh-huh . -- and loved it . Uh-huh . But , we needed to get back , uh -- Yeah . -- to our older parents . Uh-huh . But , I am loving it . The weather is divine . Really ? Yes . W- , uh , 

did you like Oklahoma , Oh , yes . while you were there ? Very much . Yeah . Um , what did you all do ? Well , my husband was with , uh , University of Oklahoma and , Uh-huh . Phillips University in Enid . Uh-huh . 

And then he went with , uh , a family corporation that had , uh , has oil and ranching and varied enterprises . Uh-huh . And , uh , he just quit a perfectly good job and came , we came East . Really ? Yes . So , is , uh , is he working there then or , Yes . Uh-huh . He 's doing , uh , quite a bit of consulting work and , Oh , uh-huh . has been offered a permanent position and he 's contemplating . Uh-huh . He , he 's liking this free time actually . Oh , yeah . It 's just wonderful after all , Yeah . these years of working . Yeah . Well , how did , how did you get , uh , hooked up with the T I switchboard thing ? Um , a gal who works , uh , with T I on this project . Uh-huh . I think she 's a temporary worker . Uh , mother is my best friend , Oh , I see . in Virginia . So , I see . 

we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country . Uh-huh . W- , my wife has talked more than I have , uh , she 's talked to four , five different people . It seems like she has n't talked to anybody from Dallas . In fact , she 's talked to a couple of people from North Carolina , I think . Really ? Yeah . Uh , what is her name ? Her name 's Tina . Yeah . Well , I have n't talked to her . I have n't , Yeah . I have n't talked to a Tina yet . Uh-huh . W- , uh , the , the call was probably for her . They would n't accept my , uh , T I N number , so we put hers in . 

But , uh , uh , like I said , we 're getting , getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party , Yeah . so . Yeah . But , uh , some of , yeah , I , I 've only talked to one or two and they 've , they 've all been in Dallas . But , she has n't talked to anybody , Yeah . Yeah . in Dallas , yet . So , that 's interesting . Well , you have n't told me , uh , what sports that you are active in . Well , the sport I like best probably is basketball . But , uh , I guess I 'm probably better at softball . And so I 'd , 

like during the summer months it 's , occupies quite a bit of my , Yes . time . But , I play in a couple of leagues and , and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend . But , my family usually goes with me . 

We try to do everything we can together . Well , I think that 's , uh , easy entertainment for a , Yeah . family , too . Yeah . Well , they , uh , a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams , we , uh , that 's usually the team I play on with the tournaments and stuff , and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age . So they play together , Under the stands . pretty well and , Under the , Yeah . bleachers . Yeah , pretty much . And , uh , Tina enjoys , uh , the other lady , real well . So they , you know , that 's kind of nice . It 's like getting together with , 

Yes . them . Well , it 's getting , So to speak . a little hot , is n't it ? It , Yeah . Well , it 's been raining a lot here so far . So we have n't really had any kind of real heat . I think it 's going to be warm enough this afternoon , we were noticing a while ago it 's already eighty in , in the house . So , it looks like an air conditioner , Yeah . day . But , It sure does . Or maybe this evening anyway . Yeah . It , yeah , 

but , you know , I 'm sure you 're familiar with that living , Very , here . much so . We go , we go through Enid , you know , quite a bit . We go to Tulsa from time to time . And my , my parents live in southern Illinois . So , we drive , Yeah . up there . And , well , l- , lot of times we take seventy-five 

and , uh , it seems like , seems like that goes through Enid , No . I know , No it does n't . I 've either seen the signs or , Enid is , uh , it 's in the northwest . It 's , uh , directly across the straight , uh , state from Tulsa . Uh , Um . I know I 've seen , Sure you have . the sign somewhere . Yes . Well , Enid is , Yeah . not , uh , an unknown little city . It , uh -- Right . -- an awful lot of people know where it is , or have been there . And it , Uh-huh . was , uh , a very , uh , self-sufficient , uh , wealthy , uh , town , Uh . for a long time , anyway . You know , Uh-huh . until , uh , everything happened , the bottom fell out . But , Oh , uh-huh . it 's beginning to do well . But , there 's a lot of , uh , old time wealth there that , Oh , uh-huh . has helped to stabilize things . Uh-huh . So , uh , how l- , you said you 've just lived in North Carolina just like , Si- , six months then is , Yes . Something like that . And you really like , Oh . it there , huh ? I 've heard so many people talk about that area . I 've never been there -- Well -- -- but they sure , -- it 's , it 's , say it 's pretty . pretty . The weather is wonderful . Uh , this winter we , it was just , we had so many wonderful days . And , Uh-huh . uh , I , if it got to be forty degrees , I decided it was too cold to , to walk the dogs . Is n't it , Uh-huh . funny how , how , Yeah . your standards change ? Yeah . It really does . My wife and I spent a couple years , uh , doing church work up in the state of Washington right , Yes . on the coast . And it rains , Sure . you know , a lot there . But , you get used to it . I mean , it 's like a fine mist all the time and it does n't really , it gets to where it does n't bother , Well , you . Really ? foggy and , It , misty . The moss grows , Uh-huh . on the trees in the woods up MUMBLEx , Right . eight , ten , Right . feet . Yeah . That 's the way it is , was , there , too . Yeah .
