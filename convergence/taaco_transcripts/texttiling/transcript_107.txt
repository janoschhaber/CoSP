Lynn , do you , do you want to start ? Certainly . Okay . Um , Do you want to tell me about summer vacations you 've taken or , Well , I , I tend to , uh , take two kinds of vacations , the vacations to visit family -- Uh-huh . 

-- and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that . Which is your favorite ? Oh , well , I could n't live without the family vacations , but , uh , my favorite is the , the indulgent ones , where we go off and , and , uh , see places that have interested me since I was a kid , Uh-huh . for the most part . And , uh , Your family does n't live close , then ? Uh , not anymore . They , uh , they 've been in San Diego for the last few years , and they 're moving to Florida . Okay . And that 's one of those things , you just have to go once a year . Yep , I understand . So , uh , basically it , it sorts out into that , and then once , about once every three or four years I try to get over to England , because I lived there for a while , Wow . some years back . I 've only been there once . Oh . 

and I 'd love to go back . Beautiful country . Beautiful country , And it was , beautiful people . Yeah , 

it , But , uh , and I 'd real , we had a great time . really like to go because , um , I 'm fairly recently married and , and my husband has been hearing about these people for years and , uh , but he 's never met them , so , uh , I 'd like , I 'd like to do that . But anyway , that 's , that 's our typical vacation , and , uh , we enjoy the family vacations , but the other ones are very special getaways , and we probably take one of each every year . How about yourself ? Well , uh , we , we , as you do , take family vacations , uh , sometimes one a year , and , but this year we 're not going to be taking one for several reasons . But vacations we really enjoy , I think we 've been on three cruises . Oh , I 've never , And we , been on a cruise . we really love cruises . We 've gone on CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES . Uh-huh . And , uh , we 've gone fairly inexpensive from , as most cruises go . 

Uh , we usually book just a month before it 's ready to go . Yeah . And we get upgraded . Last ti- , last two times , in fact , we had an outside room and it was beautiful . Um . And we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around . It 's kind of , Well , what do you do on a cruise ? I 've never been on a cruise . 

Oh , my God , you do everything . You , I mean , you can be as busy as you want to be , or as laid back as you want to be . You can sit in the sun all day around the pool , or you can take part in the games that they have going on . They always have bingo . They have a casino . Uh , they have a massage parlor . They have exercise , I mean , you can do anything . Huh . And that 's just aboard ship . And then when the ship docks , you get to go sight-seeing and shopping . Uh-huh . And that 's quite fun . Uh-huh . And where have you been on these cruises ? Uh , Nassau , San Juan , Saint Thomas . We 've been there twice . We went two cruises that hit those islands , but with different people . We , we 've gone with friends each time . I see . And then we went to , uh , the western Caribbean , which is , uh , Port , uh , Cancun , Cozumel , Oh , the , the Mexican coast . and Ocho Rios . Pardon me ? That 's all Mexico , I think . Yes , uh-huh . And , but it was wonderful . So we really like those . And , uh , I guess we just like to go someplace , someplace entirely different . We 've been to a few places in this country . We still have a lot to see , though . Where are you from originally ? We 're from Illinois originally . Uh-huh . And we 've been down in Texas eighteen years , and so , like you , we always try to make it , you know , back home to see the relatives . We both still have family there . Uh-huh . And that 's fun . It brings back a lot of memories . Oh , yes . Uh , things are different there , though . They 're , uh , I do n't know . It 's just entirely different world than this area . Well , I , I grew up in Dallas , so I mean , Did you ? it 's not , it 's not like I 'm going home . My , Uh-huh . my parents retired first to San Diego , and they 're going now to Florida , and so they 're going very nice places , thank God , Uh-huh . that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know . I really came to love San Diego and feel very , comfortable there . They 've been there eight years . Uh-huh . And , uh , you know , I just grab the car and drive everywhere . Oh , that 's great . So it , it is , it is nice , but it 's not home . This is home , and , um , and I 've never thought about a cruise . It 's so funny . Oh , they , they , they really are . We 've , yeah , as I said , we 've done them three times . We 'd be going again this , this year if circumstances had n't changed . We , Uh-huh . we 'd probably go . My husband would , you know , the minute I said the word , he , he , he 's chomping at the bit . He kind of likes the casinos a little bit . Uh-huh . But I like all of that . What 's the best part , from your point of view ? I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places . Uh-huh . I like shopping . I can shop anyplace , shop in London and France and wherever . Now , my kids are moving to Toronto , so we 're going to be able to go up there . Oh , that will be nice . So I 'm kind of looking forward to that , except I hate to see them go . Oh , sure . But , Sure . Well , go in , do n't go in the winter . Oh , that 's what everybody says , and I , I think it 's , I think I 'll try to stay away , except my , my second grandchild will be born in in the winter in January . Oh . So that will be hard to stay away from . Well , th- , there are exceptions made for special occasions like that . Yeah . But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer so , Is n't that the truth , uh-huh . Huh . Well , that sounds wonderful . I , I guess I , I would contemplate going on a cruise , uh , oh , all circumstances permitting it . Well , there 's all age grou- , groups too , and that 's , that 's kind of fun . Uh , you , if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals , you meet different people . Uh-huh . You may meet people , you know , thirty years older than you , or younger , and everybody is really interesting , and everybody is there to have a good time and , Huh . How long are the cruises ? Uh , we 've only gone on the seven day cruises . Uh-huh . They have shorter ones and then they have ten day ones . But I think seven days is long enough for us . By that time we 're ready to get home and get back to our routine . Yeah . I think most vacations , uh , seven days is enough for us . We 've gone , I think when we went to England and France , we were there ten , twelve days , and that was pushing it a bit . Yeah . Uh , I tend , when , when I spend enough money to go overseas , I , Yeah . go for a long time . Well , that , that makes sense , it really does . I mean , oh , we went to Panama too . Oh , that 's interesting . Went to Panama last August . Uh-huh . Our son-in-law is from Panama . Oh . And , uh , we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents , who live there . Uh-huh . And his father is a , a doctor and his mother is a kindergarten teacher , and they took time off , it was their winter and they were having a little break , so they took some time off that , uh , they could show us around . And it , it is a beautiful country . Huh . It is beautiful . They have mountains . We were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore . That 's really nice . And it , it is gorgeous . They live in a small town called David , which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica . Uh-huh . And , uh , it 's , it 's just , it 's just a gorgeous country . Most people do n't realize it . I think if they could get tourists coming to their country , they 'd improve the economy considerably . Huh . Well , may , maybe now things are calming down again . Yeah . That will happen . We really hope , hope so . Well , that , that 's really great . Uh , Yeah . I , I mean , as I said , basically all I 've done is go back and forth to parents and , uh , Well , that , that 's , that 's pretty good . That 's pretty good . And , and , uh , we had , MUMBLEx my husband had a conference in L A , so we spent a week in L A and of course , Oh , do you like L A ? Uh , I 'm , I 'm , I 'm very unusual . I like ,
