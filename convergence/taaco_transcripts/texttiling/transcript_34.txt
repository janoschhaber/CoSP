Our community does n't really have any organized recycling drive . Where do you live ? I live in San Antonio . San Antonio ! Uh-huh . Well , uh , I live in Garland and we 're just beginning to , we , we just built a real big recycling center , Uh-huh . that recycles everything imaginable but , as far as , uh , trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing , Uh-huh . they 're testing that . So , they 're really not full , full force into it , but they 're trying , so we 're attempting it , 

but I wish we could do more . Yeah , there 's , there 's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio . I used to work for the power company here and there was discussion for a while about , uh , building a garbage burning , uh , Uh-huh . electric generation plant but it just was n't cost effective , at the time . Oh . And there 's , there 's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city but there is n't any , uh , advertising campaign . 

There 's just not any push to recycle . Huh . I recycle my newspapers and , uh , alumi- , my aluminum stuff . Right , that 's what I do . But , uh , they make it as hard as possible , it 's not very convenient to do . Right , when they put centers and stuff like that . Uh-huh . Yeah , well we have those , uh , which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans . 

I do n't know if you all have those things around . Yes . And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they 're in almost every shopping center , and you can just stop by . Now everything else like the tra- , uh , paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers but , Uh-huh . but for aluminum that 's real nice and I started doing that at work . Um , I put out a , a trash can and , and for people to put their aluminum cans in , Uh-huh . and that 's really helped a lot , I mean , everybody 's pitched in and , Yeah . 

you know , it does n't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can . Yeah . So , I really , I really like that , but , people are really concerned , it 's just that sometimes it 's not the right people , Yeah . which is really , really sad because , I wish we would do more . At work we started , uh , all the recycling stuff . They 're really trying , I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year . Yes . And , uh , that really , started a lot of stuff off , but , you know sometimes it dwindles down . Yeah , where I work now we recycle all the computer paper . That 's good . But that 's about the extent of it . Well that 's , uh , at least you 're trying something . Yeah , yeah , It 's just yeah , 

it would be nice if it could be more . And I 'm sure that the , uh , driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so . Oh do you really . We sell the paper back to the , uh , to a paper manufacturing company . Well that 's a neat idea . Well , it , it defrays the cost of buying the paper , I think . I , 

not by much , but it does defray it some . Right . Enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building . Well that 's , that 's really good , I mean at least they 're trying . Yeah . Yeah I know a lot of companies that waste so much that , I 'm even trying , 

you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building Yes . And they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster and I thought , I do n't understand this , you know . Yeah . We 're trying to cut cost and everything like that , and , and recycle and all that stuff and , and here we are wasting . 

And I do n't understand , sometimes , the way , the thinking , the logic behind it . Well the last time , uh , someone moved offices in my building and , uh , the , uh , properties people came in with all , with the good cardboard boxes . Not the cheap ones of course . Uh-huh . And packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around , I , I took several home because I 'm moving pretty soon and they 're good boxes . That 's exactly what I did . And they were just going to throw them away . Exactly what I did , exactly . Yeah . Because I did n't want to waste that . Huh-uh . And it 's hard enough to find good packing boxes MUMBLEx . Right and , and these boxes are , you can unfold them . Right . 

So , you know , there , they do n't take up much storage space . Exactly right , well that 's very good . Yeah , yeah I , I felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until I realized they would be thrown away , so . Right , right , I thought , well I was doing them a favor by taking them . I found about five , uh , about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes , Yeah . that were in the dumpsters . Oh gosh , 

so many people need , so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes , Uh-huh . when , you know , these are perfect , so . Yeah , the ones at the grocery store , half the time , they 've pulled the lid off so you ca n't use it anyway . Right , right , right . Those 

and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in , with the nice lids . Those get thrown away . Uh-huh , right . And I am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes . That 's exactly what I do . Those are perfect boxes to put files in . Uh-huh . They 're good for storage and stuff like that . That 's what I do with a lot of my daughter 's things is I 'll store her , you know , like her out dated or , out of , out of season clothes in them and they 're just perfect . What , what I 've done in the past , I do n't have any now , but I would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids , Uh-huh . and you can stack them up and , and leave them out and put things in them , even . And they look just as good . That 's a smart idea . Uh-huh , yeah . I think I 'll have to try that . 

That 's really cute . Yeah well , you know , it 's cheaper than going and buying the kind at Target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever . They 're the exact same thing . That 's all they are , they just made them look fancy . Uh-huh , yeah . You saved me some money . And you 're recycling . yeah . Well that 's neat . Well do you all have , uh , we have places that , uh , pay for paper to recycle , I know you do yours at work , 

but for newspaper . Uh-huh . But ours are real hard to find . That 's the one thing that really discourages me . I saved pa- , you know , I recycle paper , but they , 

it 's almost like they do n't want the paper , because they do n't pay , at all , I mean , they 're real hard to find the places that pay . And that 's really discouraging . I mean , I just go ahead and take it to the , the regular place , where it 's , you know , they just accept it . But they , uh , I think they should yeah , if they want people to recycle I think it 's , uh , you know , like the aluminum , you know , it gets people to , uh , doing it , you know , you might , you do n't have to pay them a lot . Yeah , I live near a Walmart and there 's a big , uh , uh , huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front , in fact I think there 's two of them , that have several openings , Uh-huh . and it 's for recycling and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category , Uh-huh . I do n't , maybe there 's two for aluminum . And you do n't get paid but it 's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there . Well that 's , that 's good . Yeah . I , the one thing I do n't like about the newspaper also is , uh , like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk . You have one for paper and one for just your normal trash , Uh-huh . but in , uh , in the paper one you have to separate . You have to make sure you do n't throw away any of the slick paper , like magazines . Uh-huh . You ca n't throw any of that away and you ca n't throw certain file type things away , and I just think it 's such a hassle , it seems like it would be , it would be easy to take it all , I do n't know , of course , I do n't know all that about recycling so , Uh-huh . it probably is a hassle . But I do get tired of having to separate paper , you know . Uh-huh . It gets to be , uh , I guess you have to make it a habit , I mean , you have to get so used to doing it that it 's a habit . Right , right . And we had , uh , a write up in our paper , uh , this last time at work about , um , they come and empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash and every other day they do your recycling trash . Uh-huh . And somebody was writing in complaining that the people had , uh , dumped all the trash in the same bin . Oh . And when they were questioned about it they said well , we 're running late , or we did n't have time to do those bins or something and that 's real discouraging . Thinking you 're sitting there working to separate it and then they , And someone else is n't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags . Right , right , so they 're , they 're really , trying to start keeping an eye out for those , you know talking to the people again about , you know , separate them because that is discouraging when you , when you do that . It was hard to get used to those two different trash cans . Uh-huh . But luckily that will all get straightened out and , and they 'll , they 'll start separating them . Because , I do n't mind doing that , I feel like I 'm doing , uh , doing something for the community when I 'm doing that . Yeah . But anyway . Well , I 've enjoyed talking to you . You too . Well , I , thank you . Bye , bye . Bye .
