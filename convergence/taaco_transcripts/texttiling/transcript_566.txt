Well , uh , does the company you work for test for drugs ? Actually , uh , they just recently started a policy of testing drugs , which was kind of interesting , because w , when I went to work for them , uh , they did n't do that , but , uh , since then they 've , they 've started a drug testing policy , not because of their own , uh , convictions , but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that . Huh . How about you ? Uh , no , we 're not being tested for drugs at all , uh , 

our policies and procedures manual , uh , the furthest it goes about drugs is in the , kind of the miscellaneous section , or -- Uh-huh . -- its reasons for immediate dismissal , it says , use of narcotics on company premises . Um . So that 's pretty general , but , uh , I work for an environmental management firm -- Okay . -- and I 'm an engineer there , but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites , but I do n't operate any machinery . Yeah . 

Now , people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that -- Uh-huh . -- are under a , a medical monitoring program , because they 're at a higher risk of exposure and blood screening is part of that and I , I think that drugs , they do test for drugs in that capacity , but it 's not their exclusive , it 's just part , it 's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for . Yeah . But I think it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field . 

What is the nature of your company 's business ? Well , it 's actually , uh , we do oil well services . So , a lot of our clients are oil companies , big oil companies , and they go out to , we have engineers who , uh , go out to the oil well , to the , to the client 's oil well , and , and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff , so the clients are very concerned that , you know , the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy , because they 're on their , their , you know , territory and everything , 

but -- Um . -- the thing that 's interesting is that I w- , I 'm an engineer and , a software engineer and I work in the software , uh , house , and everybody there , you know , are all software engineers . They 've never , you know , they never go out to the , the oil rigs or anything , and yet , we 're getting , we 're subjected to this policy , you know , the same one that , uh , th- , all the engineers have to , to , well , a little different , actually , but , uh , you know , we have to go through the same thing , and it 's , but it 's , uh , it 's a little different , I guess than , than a lot of drug policies . In our case , it 's like , when you hire on , they 'll test you , 

and then if you get injured on the job , if you like trip and fall or something , uh , they give you a drug test right away . Oh , really ? Other than that they do n't have random testing or anything like that , but , a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first . Particularly , like , uh , we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol , and tha- , they did n't find any problem with that , you know , but , Right . Uh , We , that 's been an , a , an issue , uh , in our company even though we do n't have the random or even regular drug screening . In fact , they 'll have these little parties , and people will just get , I mean , I 've , my brother lives where I work , and I have many a time called him to come get me , you know . 

And , uh , uh , but , y- , you know , they do n't think twice about serving beer by the keg . Yeah . You know , but , uh , I think drug testing , and I , I do n't know , I guess I k- , I think it 's got some relevance , but I think its relevance is pretty limited . I mean , I think , you know , 

in your case , I do n't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing . Yeah . 

I think that 's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident . Yeah , it 's really , it 's really bizarre . Uh , particularly , like where we are , you know . I , I , there was a story of a woman last year who , who actually did slip on the ice and , and like sprained her ankle and she , she was a personnel secretary and she had to get tested and , I do n't know I 'm ambivalent about the whole thing . I , you know , I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand , it 's like if , you know , they 're , they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense and , you know , it 's like you 're , I mean , employments are contractual by nature anyway -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that , where I had to , uh , uh , do a drug test and , and it 's , it was kind of a long story , but it was , it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through , and it amounted to , uh , going in , uh , before any of these interviews , I 'm not even working for this company , I 'm going in for , like , interviews and they flew me out to Chicago and , and , uh , before I went into any of the interviews , uh , they took me to the doctor to give me a physical . They said it was going to be a physical , you know , and , uh , actually bec- , beforehand they told me they were going to , uh , do drug screening , but I had forgotten about that , and so , basically , I 'd already peed off in that morning and , and when I got in there , I did n't , I was n't , like , able to give a full sample , and so -- Oh . -- they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes , drink a whole ton of water -- Right . -- before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again , and the , and the , the procedure is utterly humiliating . You go in there with the doctor , he makes you take off all your clothes 

and then he examines you .
