Well , have you seen a new movie lately ? Well , uh , I am a student and I have , uh , been actually watching more movies on video , Uh-huh . than being able to go out to see , uh , movies at the store , or at the theater . Uh , I st- , I want to see the FISHER KING and , and , uh , catch ROBIN HOOD . Okay . I , uh , I have n't seen either one of those . Uh , what , what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though ? Uh , let 's see . Uh , I 'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on . Uh , WHITE PALACE which I thought was over rated , over hyped , um , recently . Well , you 're catching me at , it , uh , uh , at mind 's end here . 

What have you seen recently ? . Well , maybe you , uh , you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES . Yes . Okay . Yes . What did you think of that one ? Enjoyed that quite a bit . Um , I thought the , uh , the cima- , the cinematography was excellent . Uh-huh . Uh , the story was , uh , though it tended to be a little one sided -- Yeah . -- uh , it was good . Uh , it was , it was believable . I , uh , I just moved down , in fact , from South Dakota in , in June , and that 's when the movie was filmed , Uh-huh . and , uh , we , when , when the movie came out , we went , uh , my dad lives in the state capital , which is Pierre -- Uh-huh . -- and it was filmed right outside of Pierre . In fact , the buffalo , the scene , the big buffalo herd scene , that was , that was a live scene . Wow . Uh , there 's a guy that has got a , a buffalo farm , and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and , and , uh , we , my dad has got a little plane , we flew over it all a- , looked at the buffalo , it was really neat . But , uh , so we are watching the , the movie in the movie theater in Pierre -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , just every time I would start to get into the movie , and it was getting good -- Uh-huh . -- someone in the crowd would yell , hey , there 's John Red Eagle , you know or , you know , they 'd start recognizing people . They knew , they knew the extras or the , Yeah . So , I kind of , I think I enjoyed it more when I , when I watched it on video cassette than I did , uh , in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they 'd say that . I 'd go now , now which one could that be -- Uh-huh . -- you know , and I 'd , I 'd start trying to focus in on people instead of , of picking up the overall , Scope . Right . Exactly . Uh-huh . So , but I , I thought it was a good film . But you are right , I think , I think it was very one sided . It , it was , but it 's a side that has n't been told . Uh , as far as , you know , telling it from , you know , the Indians as the good guys and the , the white men as the bad guys . I , I really thought about , uh , all the , the westerns that we have seen for years and years , Sure . and it 's just , shoot the Indians , and they are always the savages . Right . So , In fact , I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night and , it was a similar , uh , situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking a , an army fort . Uh-huh . Um , but it was an interesting movie . Uh , have you seen PRETTY WOMAN ? Yes . Now I thought that was a good show . Yeah . That was , that was a good movie . Um , it was just kind of a get away movie . Yeah . Kind of , It did n't , uh , it did n't have any real social bearing or , uh , and it was n't really a comedy , but it was an enjoyable movie . It was , it was kind of like the STAR WARS -- Uh-huh . -- s- , series , you know , just something a little different , Right . yet believable . Yes . You 're bringing it , I do n't know , I had a , I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I 've seen . But , yeah , I 've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES , and , uh , Uh , now are you , are you going to see , or do you , are you much of a STAR TREK fan , are you going to see this next one that 's coming out ? Oh , definitely . Have you seen the rest ? Yes . I think I 've missed one . I 'm not sure , but I think I 've missed one . I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago , and they showed all five in a row . Was that here in Dallas ? Oh , they had it everywhere , uh , every major city had one theater that did it and , Okay . Because we had one here in Dallas . Right , and they did it in Houston , they did it , well , they did it everywhere . And it was , it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed , and the thing that I did n't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row , uh , time wise they happen one after another -- Uh-huh . -- and just no , no time between them , but you can watch the characters develop ,
