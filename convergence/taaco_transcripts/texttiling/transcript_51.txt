Ok- , okay . What , what is , do you have a favorite recipe ? Um , yeah , that 's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe , well , it says , why would you , what you would have for a dinner party . Um , this is strange because I pressed one and I thought it said begin . Oh . Okay , maybe , maybe we 're all set . Okay , we 'll talk for five minutes , they interrupt at the end . Um , yeah , it says what you would have for a dinner party , I just happen to plan one out for Saturday 

I 'll tell you , Oh , that 's wonderful . what I 'm going to have . Okay . Um , if I can find it . Well , I have this new fondue pot and I was going to do basic cheese fondue , and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham and I was going to try something weird which , you know , when you have fish au gratin , I was going to make some , uh , like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue . I do n't know if it will come out . That 's , what kind of fondue , the cheese dip or , Yeah , the cheese fondue I make , some people like swiss , um , I prefer cheddar . And I 'll mix , 

I wo n't make , I wo n't have a sharp cheddar because it , for fondue I think it should be a little calmer than real sharp , Right . cheddar . Yeah . And then I was going to make other things like potato skins . Oh , that sounds good . It- , see you do n't necessarily have to dip this stuff . 

And , um , I was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a , a vegetable . That 's always a good thing . Vegetable trays always go over so well , because I think people get tired of eating junk . I mean , I think they like to have healthy stuff too , you know it 's , Oh , yeah , it 's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party . Oh , definitely . I think better even than , than other kinds of food . Yeah , instead of something greasy or , Right , exactly . Yeah . MUMBLEx my , uh , girlfriends do catering and they always , about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray . I think they try and suggest it . Uh-huh . What I 've been doing when I get invited someplace and bring something , I make , uh , food kabobs . You take little toothpicks and cut up , Oh . uh , pineapple and strawberry , Yes . 

and even banana if you can do it just before you leave . Right . It stays nice and fresh . Right , that 's true . Or even have you ever seen where they , they 'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out , Yeah . and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat MUMBLEx . Yeah , 

I like those . Yep . Um , they , they made a couple of those , uh , they made one for my , uh , bridal shower and I was pretty pleased . I never made one for myself though . But they look easy enough to make it 's not , Oh , I think it would , it would be a lot of work but , um , Yeah . you know , because it 's , you know , you have to cut each thing or , you know , use the melon baller and stuff but , but I think they 're really neat 

and , you know , I think they 're worth the time , you know , because they , Yeah , you probably get this , probably pretty sticky after you get done . Oh , yeah Then you 've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because , you know , when you scrape it , it makes the water . Right . Yeah . Yeah , um , something I do is a fruit , is , I 'll get , um , make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them . Yeah , I have two nieces and they , they MUMBLEx they go melt some chocolate chips , . Go buy me some strawberries . Is that , is that good ? You know , I 've seen that so many times , strawberries dipped in chocolate but I 've never tried it , are they really good ? Yeah , ther- , you know , if you get a sweet strawberry they 're much better , but if you get a sour strawberry , Oh , I bet it does n't mix well , does it ? Huh . Yeah , no , they , um , the strawberries are coming in season now from , they 're , they 're coming up from Florida , of course . I live in Vermont , so . But they 're really reasonably priced , they 're coming up from Florida , so . Oh , well , that 's good because I know they 've been really expensive lately . Yeah . Because they were n't in season , of course , they had to be , be , uh , grown in greenhouses and stuff and in , Yeah , I think the , uh , actually I think they get , um , some of them from South America . Oh , is that right ? Yep , they , a lot of , um , of a , um , winter produce comes from South America . Oh , I MUMBLEx . Of course , their seasons are switched . Uh-huh . Right . So , um , do you want to discuss the recipe ? Well , I have a recipe if you want . Okay , sure , su- , Um , it filled , a lot of people try to stay away from this but I make my own homemade pudding just because I do n't like box pudding . Is that right ? I 've never heard of that . Yeah , it , and it MUMBLEx if you , um , well , first of all I MUMBLEx take about a quarter and a half of milk and I put it in a two quart saucepan and you put it on a really low heat . Uh-huh . And you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it , it ends up burning , I mean , no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot . Uh-huh . I do n't let that worry me . And I get the milk lukewarm and then I pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it and I have this thing it 's called the slender blender , it , it makes the , uh , it makes , uh , a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough . It 's , uh , I do n't know , they 're called moo goo leaves or something they 're sl- , I think I know what you 're talk , is it like a hand held ? Yeah . They 're real neat . The , yeah , okay . I think they 're real reasonably priced , some of them , they used to be a hundred dollars , and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but I did n't get that one , I got the Black and Decker kind . But , uh , it 's real handy because it does n't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the mil- , the milk , you know , and it does an excellent job , or just hand beat it . I guess you could use a hand mixer but I do n't think it pur- , I do n't think it gets it good enough . Uh-huh . And then before the milk gets too hot , um , I add two beaten eggs and I really mix them in good . And then about a half a cup of sugar and I let it pretty much , I beat it like every minute for about ten seconds and it 's , it starts thickening , when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little , I do n't know , it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch , and you just keep beating it in . And it 's the , the trick is , is to have this blender , so , if you were , you 'd have to probably almost go out and MUMBLEx someone who 's just going to make it first time , it 's , you 'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders . Huh . And then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it 's thickened I cook it for a good , once it starts boiling , I just , I cook it for a good seven minutes , Uh-huh . seven to ten minutes and then you can make chocolate or you can take it off and let it cool MUMBLEx you put , um , really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter and that makes french vanilla , um , custard . Yeah , Oh , wow . That is really interesting . Are you saying to use like , um , for chocolate like , unsweetened , A chocolate powder . unsweetened ? Yeah , that cocoa , yeah , the unsweetened . It comes in like a real dark can , Yeah . our mothers used to use it . And then , Ri- , I have some . Yeah , we all used to , I just want to , yeah it 's the unsweetened kind it 's not like Nestles Quik . Right . Okay . I suppose you could use that . I- , Cooking chocolate . Yeah , but , um , That 's really interesting , I 've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that 's really neat . Well , I used to make the regular pudding , the chocolate and put it in the pie shell and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day , where you cut the pie , it would soak into the pie shell and it was like red , and I 'm like , oh , this is kind of groedy . Well , how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own ? Um , actually I found it in one of my mother 's , um , homemade cookbooks , I mean , Is that right ? something she had collected out of WOMAN 'S DAY or something . Oh , neat , So , that is just really neat . Because I , I think you could n't make it with a hand whisk or , or a regular beater but , um , It would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good . Yeah , but I still think a beater would do it good enough , um , the trick is to get the cornstarch , Uh-huh . um , yeah right in the , in the lukewarm milk . Sometimes I put the cornstarch in a separate bowl and I would put it in the sink and I 'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good . It seems to be better than putting the , the cornstarch into the liquid it , once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top . So you put the milk in the cornstarch ? Yeah . And I 'll do this , uh , sometimes MUMBLEx I 'll put my after I pour that into my , back into my saucepan . I 'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg . So , And then put that back in the saucepan ? Yep . And then , you know , if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to . The cocoa even seems to thicken it even more . Huh that 's , Because by the vanilla does n't seem to thicken as well as the , sometimes the cocoa is like , my husband really likes it thick he says , I can stick the spoon right in this . Oh . Because I 'm always worrying it wo n't firm up because it , when you take it out of the saucepan it 's like , boy , I hope this thickens a little more because it 's not like real package thick , you know , when you cook a package , Uh-huh . it 's , it 's a little less , but I put it in a nice glass bowl and , um , some people do n't like that , that , film on the pudding so you can put , uh , Saran Wrap over the top . Uh-huh . And then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap , so , when you pull the Saran Wrap back , you sort of should be a little careful , pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap and I might put it back on . But , um , Do yo- , do you put it in the refrigerator then or y- , Yeah , after , well when it starts steaming a lot , uh , I definitely , yeah , put it in the refrigerator , Uh-huh . but , um , I , my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you 're going to make it work too hard . Right , that 's true . I knew that . That 's , yeah , Yeah . so , , that 's why I do that . Yeah . So , well , I do n't know that 's my , my great hard recipe .
