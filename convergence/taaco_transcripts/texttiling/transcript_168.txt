There we go . Right . Well , actually I 'm a , I 'm a Dodgers fan from way back . Oh -- Um , -- how way back , I mean Like , um , late fifties , early sixties . Okay so Wally Moon moon shots and all that . What 's that ? Yeah , coliseum , Wally Moon and all that . Yeah . Okay , yeah , it 's a , um , I , I 'm living in , just west of Baltimore , and Frederick , um , which is also just west of Baltimore , has a minor league team . And , uh , and , Wally Moon is the manager of them . Is that right ? Yeah , so he 's still kicking around . That 's interesting . Yeah , I , I also lived eight years in Ohio before going to , uh , going away to college , 

and I used to go watch the Toledo Mudhens . Oh , I saw them , um , um , I was out there last Summer , and I saw a game at Ned Skelton . Is that the stadium ? Uh , I could n't tell you for sure . It 's been a long time . Oh , okay . So , um , there used to be a , uh , race track . Uh-huh . Yeah , it was , that was impression I got when I was there so , Yeah , 

I think that 's right . Okay , yeah , so had a lot of fun actually , I mean , I like minor league baseball , a lot . It 's cheaper for one thing . Well , that 's true . I think , I 've kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since I 've been here . Uh , they 've led the American league in batting , fielding and pitching , but they 've never been able to do more than one of those in any , any given year . So . Yes . I think they 're in for a odd year this year , actually , um , they , um , I do n't understand why Encovilla got released . I do n't either . I mean , the guy 's twenty , twenty-five home rums , maybe thirty , eighty some R B I-s . I mean , he , you know , he ca n't field and , you know , he strikes out a lot , but , I mean , he 's done that for five years . Why get rid of him now ? Really , I mean , he really has become a , a very decent fielder . Oh , yes . Okay . 

He 's not a , the liability that he was , that he used to be . Oh , okay . Um . Oh , he fits right in with Texas bunch of guys , I mean with Detroit , bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot . Yeah , of course , get a guy like Cecil Fielder , you know , if he strikes out a lot , so what . Yeah , well , I mean , with Detroit , I mean , they can get away with one guy like that . 

I mean , if I , if I were in Detroit , I would start building the team around Fielder . Oh , yeah . But that does n't mean get three other guys who hit , all they can do is hit home runs and strike out -- Right . -- you know , which they did . Yep . So . 

Well , I think the key for , for L A this year is whether Oral Herschiser can come back . I think the pitching 's deep enough that it does n't matter . It may be . I , I like them a lot . I think they 're going to go all the way . Um , and , and , I mean , by saying I like them , I like their chances . I , I actually do n't like the Dodgers , I 'm a Giants fan -- Right , right . -- from way back . Well , picking up Darrell Strawberry did n't hurt . No , but Butler did n't hurt either . Uh , and Bobby Ojeda did n't hurt and , Uh , who 's the last one . Bobby Ojeda . They got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks . 

Oh , okay . Um , he 's a , a pretty decent pitcher . He 's , Yes he is . Okay , you know , he MUMBLEx . Yes . And , uh , that guy MUMBLEx , the short stop , is going to be good . Yeah . Um . Well it should be an interesting year . Yeah , I 'm looking , I 've already been to one game , and I should have been to two 

but , Are you an Orioles fan ? Um , the , the team I live and die with actually is the Red Sox , mostly die , but , um , I go to the Orioles since they 're here , and I , you know , I do enjoy them . Yeah . Um , I 've had an opening day on Monday . Yeah , you know , I kind of wish that they had inter league play , like they do in all the other sports so I could see some of the National League teams here once in a while . MUMBLEx How far is Houston ? Uh , three hundred miles . Oh , okay , keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes . Yeah , it is , it 's incredible . Yeah , I , um , you know , we 're , we 're pretty lucky because if I want to see a National League team , I can usually go up to Philadelphia . There you go . And , um , saw , saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year , and a bunch of teams the year before . Boy , you are a baseball fan , are n't you . Okay , uh , yeah . Interesting . Um , I try to see whatever I can . I mean , I 've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years . Wow . Yeah , hope I 'm going to do it this year because , um , uh , having a kid this fall , so it 's like -- All right . -- so much for going to lots of baseball games . So , so do it while you can . Yeah , seriously . Sure . Well , it 's been good talking with you . Yeah , good talking with you . And , and you 'll be happy I think in October when the Dodgers win . I would n't mind it . Yeah , I 'll be , I 'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right . Yeah , well , God bless and good talking with you . And good talking with you . Take care . Bye-bye . 

Bye .
