I was going to say , my , uh , college is Northern State University in Aberdeen , South Dakota , and our head football coach , Dennis Muir , used to be an assistant coach at B Y U . Oh , really . So I thought that was kind of an in , interesting coincidence . Huh . So you went to what college ? Uh , Northern State University in Aberdeen , South Dakota . And what did you graduate in ? I ju- , 

in what major or what year ? Yeah , major . International business . Oh , really . Yeah . And you ? I 'm going to B Y U , and I 'm going into nursing -- Okay . -- so . Well , that sounds interesting . How long of a program is that ? Forever .  Seems like , anyways . It 's about five years , but it 's probably going to take me longer , because I did n't decide to major in that until , uh , about a year and a half after I was already in school , so . You know , I read a study once , and it said that , uh , like thirty-four percent of , uh , college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program . Oh , really . That sounds . It took me , it took me five years . Yeah . So , you just , you get started and you change your mind , or you want to pick up a second major , if you 're management , you , you , thought , I , I 'll take that marketing , it 's just only was three more classes -- Yeah . -- you know , and you , just does n't happen that you get out in four years . Uh-huh . But . So what is your advice to -- My advice is -- -- picking a college . -- is , uh , look for , at the student to faculty ratio , you know , if you 're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one , I do n't think you 're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you 're down to the thirty to forty to one . Uh-huh . Is that , what was yours more like ? Yeah -- Was there a , -- it was about twenty-six to one . Really . Yeah . Oh , that 's great . Which is , you know , it , it 's interesting , but it , it 's what I thought was nice is you could al- , there was always time to talk to professor , you know , and , and they knew you . Uh-huh . You were n't just in their class , you know , and so you could , you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time , and , or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever , you know , you could sit down , talk to them about a problem . They 're always willing to help you out . So , but I , I 's , I , I put that against , uh , my high school where we had , uh , a biology class of three hundred and fifty students and . Wow , in high school ? Yeah -- Oh . -- it was a biology lecture class -- Wow . -- and , you know , it , it just was n't the same . You 're sitting there , and you 're taking notes and , you know , you got a computerized test scores , multiple choice , because there 's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test -- Uh-huh . -- uh , you know , a three hundred fifty person short answer test . And , it just was n't the same . You , you 'd run , you 'd pass the teacher in high school and , even in high school you could say high to your teachers , unless you 're in that biology class , and they just , they 'd look at you like , do I know you ? or should I know you ? Uh-huh . Yeah , there 's , it 's , the classes here are pretty big , so , it 's hard to get individual help . It 's kind of , you 're on your own . Do you get , uh , a lot of tutoring , or . No . Very little , I mean , well , like my , for example , I have , I 'm in a chemistry class right now -- Uh-huh . -- and there 's tons of students in it , and there 's one T A for the whole class .  And he only has certain office hours , and so there 's only certain times you can talk to him , and . And you could get there and his office hours could , I mean he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty-two people waiting to talk to him , and you still did n't get to talk to him anyway . Right , yeah . Well , what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college ? Oh , man . I think your advice is good . Um let 's see . My advice would be to pick a major before you get into college -- That 's excellent advice . -- because I , I did n't , and I took tons of classes that I did n't need to , and , um , I do n't know , I just feel like I 'm , it 's , it 's going to take me a lot longer than , and not that 's always bad , but it 's , I do n't know , it 's frustrating , I guess . Well , it , it , it does get it . You know , you get to the point where it 's , I 'm never going to get done . Right . You know , I , I mean , I was taking summer classes and MUMBLEx let me get out of here . Yep . But , uh , no , that 's good advice . Even if you do n't have your major decided on , have an idea what you think you might want , you know , so you do n't want management , but you think you want business ,
