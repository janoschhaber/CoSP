I am actually -- Or junior ? -- a junior . You 're a junior . Beginning of my junior year . Good for you . So , What are you studying ? Nursing . Good for you . You sound like a girl that has it together . I would just encourage you to do a little traveling , though , before you get married .

You really should go to Europe . I went to Europe for six weeks after I graduated from college and that was just , I , I mean I could have had that or a down payment on a new car and I took the trip .
