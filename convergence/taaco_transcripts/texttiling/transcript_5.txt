Hello . Hello , Hi . Hello this is Lois . Hi , hi , this is Lisa . And , uh , I called you know , from that , the , the T I Data Base Calling Instructions . Uh-huh . Yeah , I got a call yesterday too . This is a different subject though . Yeah , this is about changes in the women in the , Uh-huh . Uh , there 's really a lot , is n't there . Yeah . 

I think there really is . It 's kind of an easy thing to talk about . Oh , I guess the work force would be the main , would n't it . Yeah , uh , I think you have to push one and then we can start recording it . Okay . All right . Okay . Are you ready now ? Yes . Okay , like I said I guess it would be the work force , you know , as far as changes in the generations . Yes , I know because , I know when my mother was a , you know , going into the work force there was n't very many opportunities for her , I guess , she 's in her late forties . You were expected to stay home and take care of the kids and I 've never faced that at all . Uh , no , I think no- , now , you go to work when they 're six weeks old , Uh-huh . you know , and you stay there . And I feel like the next generation , you 'll probably just work right along with your husband , you know . Yeah , uh-huh , I think it 's definitely gotten better . Oh , I do to , much . 

And it 's just going to get better . Uh-huh . It really is . Because women are in every field now , I mean I ca n't think of a field that they 're not involved in . Oh , I ca n't either , not a one . 

And I know at least in the medical field , it seems like they 've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field . Uh-huh . I do n't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing . Yeah , even in Washington , you know , Yeah . there seems to be a lot more women involved . Hopefully , the next generation , it wo n't even be an issue , I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman , Yeah , yeah . I think that would be the best goal . Oh , I do too , just your qualifications 

and that would be it . Uh-huh , exactly , not what color you are , how old you are , what you 're male or female . That would be wonderful , I guess it 's kind of an ideal world though , huh . Yeah , I kind of think , maybe in time , that , you know , you 'll go by social security numbers , you know , Yeah . and that way they ca n't say well they picked a male over a female , female over a male , you know , Exactly , or the way you look , or the way you , you know , Yeah , yeah . your age or anything . 

I think that would be a wonderful way to do it . I do to just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that , you know , that you have . Uh-huh , and then , And then if you get it , you know then , Uh-huh , also , with , uh , women in the work force they 've gotten a lot more options as far as , you know , what 's it called , job sharing . Uh-huh . Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job , 

Oh , yeah . or , As a matter of fact , that 's what I 'm doing . Is it . Uh-huh , it sure is . That would be great . It sure is . Or , a lot of women I know now and my , uh , one of my supervisors , when she went on L O A to have her baby , we hooked up , uh , uh , a terminal at her house and she , you know , we could send her messages , 

and , and she kept in touch like that , Oh . and basically , just worked out of her house . I would just take her the actual paperwork once , uh , every week or two , and that worked out great too . Yeah , yeah that is . 

And that 's a real attractive option , if you have the , the technology for it . Uh-huh . All it was , was , you know , I mean , she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office , so I think that 's real nice too , to come up with different options . Do you like the job sharing ? Oh , I do , Do you ? I really do , I think it 's great . Do you work like half days , or half weeks or , Uh , well like , one week she 'll work three days and I 'll work two and she 'll work two , Oh , oh that 's great , and we just share off like that . Uh-huh . Do you get the full benefits ? Uh-huh , yeah 

we get the full benefits . Oh , that 's wonderful . But we 've just really got a wonderful system that we 're working under . Yeah , especially with children , and so many things going on , Yeah . that would be great . It really is , and that way we 're not really missing any thing out , you know , 

Either way , of MUMBLEx children , uh-huh . yeah , you have your career and your home life , and that would be a nice way , especially if you have young children . Oh , it is , it is , well both of ours is school age , but we do n't want to miss any of those P T A -s and , you know , all of that . Uh-huh , oh , no , I think , yeah . My son 's just in day-care but even that they have extracurricular activities 

and the older they get the more that you 're involved in that . Uh-huh . I think it 's great , I really , Yeah , and I look for more of that in the next generation . I do too , especially as women get up in management and , and can be in on those decision making , you know , when that subject comes up they can say yes , 

that would be wonderful . Yes , oh , I do too . Plus , I bet it cuts , cuts down on your absenteeism because you 've got two days off that you can do everything , so you do n't have to , you know , unless you 're just really sick , or the child 's sick . Most of the time now , you know , it 's just the weekend , or just forget it . Uh-huh , oh yeah , I have to plan way in advance , because , or , what I 've done is found like doctors ' and dentists ' office with extended hours . Uh-huh . That 's been real helpful too , like my doctor stays open til nine in the evening . So that 's real helpful , so you do n't , you know , have to do it during office hours , run out on your lunch hour . I do n't know how many times I 've done that to do something , To do , yeah . post office or the bank or any kind of errand , so . Uh-huh . Well I think we 've really come a long way in that because , Uh-huh , I guess I take it for granted , kind of , because , I just , it 's always been that way . Uh-huh . But I know , Yeah , but I can rem , remember back growing up , my mother , I mean it was she always worked , but it was n't that easy for her to just take off . Oh no , I can remember my mother getting in trouble if , you know , one of was sick , and I know she probably did n't make hardly anything , you know , compared to the work that she did . Oh yeah . I think there is still some discrimination there where as , you know , men and women work in the same job , I think men get paid more , Oh , I do too . but I think that 's improving . It 's such a slow process it 's frustrating , but , Yes , yes . you can see that it 's wrong and you just want to make it right , but at least the wheels are moving forward . They really are . Yeah , I think it 's getting better , not worse . Well , I should probably get back to my job . I know , I know the feeling . Call again . Okay , I sure will . Bye-bye . Okay , 

bye-bye .
