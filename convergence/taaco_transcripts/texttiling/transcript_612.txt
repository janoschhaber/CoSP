Oh so , Okay . I 'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so . Well , it , let 's put it this way . We 've got the New England Patriots up here so . Oh yeah . Right . Well , They 've had some serious problems in the past couple of years . Really ? Yeah . Why ? Um , well , uh , partly due to ownership . You know , uh , Victor Kiam owned the , uh , the Patriots -- Uh-huh . -- uh , for a period of a number of years and he always had this , uh , this wonderful quality of c- , being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something and , uh , they 've had some financial problems with the team and so forth . And it recently was sold to , uh , some other people 

so , hopefully , this ownership can set up new direction and , uh , keep , uh , the Patriots in the New England area anyways . Yeah . Well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway -- Oh , yeah . -- to see what happens now you , I 've been to a couple , I 've been to a few games before . Uh-huh . Now you , you 're , you 're from Texas . Right . So you 've got two football teams down there . Well , it depends on where you 're from in Texas . 

I live right by Dallas -- Uh-huh . -- so we have one football team -- Oh , I see . -- as far as we 're concerned . That 's how it is . There 's that type of segregation , huh ? It 's divided , yeah . Wow ! It really is , so we 've got our Cowboys here and -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , I do n't think anybody roots differently but -- Do you , -- I have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno 

and he is for the L , the , uh , Raiders . Uh-huh . L A Raiders , so . Do you follow professional sports at all ? Well , I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that did n't do very well , but I 've been trying more this year . I think I know a little more than I use to . Yeah . I never knew very much at all so I 'm trying . Well , it 's a good past time , you know . Yeah . Particularly football . They say , uh , i- , football attracts more men because of the , you know , y- , the , you see the , the physical aggression on the field and supposedly , psychologists say that , uh , that , uh , men take out their frustrations by watching football and , you know , they get together with a bunch of guys and they , uh , uh , and they have a good time and everything and that 's suppose to be some of the , uh , the male bonding and the , and the , uh , the male instincts , I guess , or something about the , uh , So I should n't even try to do it , huh ? Well , no . It , it 's good as , in terms of , in terms of , uh , of a contest . Yes . I think that , uh , I personally like hockey better because it has contact , it 's a contact sport . It has the speed . Right . And the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey . Not everybody can play hockey . Yeah . So we , and that 's , we 're a big hockey area up here , I bet up here in New England as well -- Really . -- as , you know , in , in the Minnesota area but , I do n't even think we have that in Texas . What , hockey ? We might . Do we ? I mean , no , you probably know , I do n't know . No , there 's no hockey , there 's no . Nobody talks about it so I do n't think we do . There 's no professional hockey teams in , in Texas MUMBLEx . No , uh-huh . And we have a soccer team that comes and goes . We do n't even have that very much , so . Yeah . I think though that professional football -- Uh-huh . -- in particular , is becoming so diluted now . Like they have this World Football League . You see , we have the N F L that , that Dallas -- Yeah . -- and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams . There are those teams that play in professional , National Football League but , uh , now they have what 's called the World Football League and they have all these teams from , there 's a team in London and there 's a team -- Oh . -- there , there 's , uh , teams , other European teams and there 's teams in the United States an- , and they 're playing now during the summer months and it 's really you know , overkill . Oh yeah . And there 's only so much football you can watch . Yeah . Well , I like to do , I do n't like to watch . Yeah , that 's good . I do n't like to watch anything . So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff . I think it 's an , excuse to do nothing and I , I can see what you 're saying about the male bonding and the -- Yeah . -- guys get together and that 's kind of cool . That 's fun , you know . Uh-huh . But it can get really overdone . Now , have you ever been to a professional football game ? Yeah , I have . Have you ? Yeah , yeah , I have . Did you do the whole big , th- , the whole thing , the tailgate party and the whole , Uh , no actually , no . Well see , now see that 's what you got to do , see . Now we talked our , I 've done that for college football . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . You , the , well the same thing . Yeah . We , we talked our wives , there 's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games . And , uh , we talked our wives into going with us one time and they had a real good time and it was , basically , for the social atmosphere . Right . And that 's the thing , you know . You go , you know three or four hours before the game . You go set up . We set a table up , we do some cooking , some barbecueing , have a few drinks -- Yeah . -- and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat , drink some more . But , but that whole , it , it 's not so much , sure the contest itself and the game itself , Yeah . I- , that you miss sitting home in your parlor , you know , uh , with , with a six pack of beer and some , uh , potato chips , you know -- That 's right . -- you , you miss that . Yeah , that 's right . And , and any professional sport I think , you miss that . Uh-huh . The atmosphere of being there , you know . Yeah . Well , in high school I went to every football game and , well , I twirled , you know . Yep . And I , you know , I did n't , I still do n't know that much about football , obviously . But I still had a good time . You know , Well foot- ,
