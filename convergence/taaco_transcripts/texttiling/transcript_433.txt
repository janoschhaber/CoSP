MUMBLEx How big is Provo ? Um . That a little town or , or a bigger city ? Um , it 's not one of the bigger ones . It 's probably , um , I compare it to the size of Plano , maybe a little smaller . Plano , Texas . Oh . I talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town , I think . Yeah , I forgot the name of the town . 

I thought maybe it was you . No . Oh , well , anyway , we 're supposed to talk about education . I certainly have some ideas since I 'm studying it now in college . I 'd say , first of all , they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading , writing , arithmetic -- Uh-huh . -- in grade school , because they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to , and it shows up . That 's one idea . Do you have any ? Um , I do n't know , I 'm pretty , I think I 'm pretty satisfied with , um , I gre , I grew up in Plano -- Uh-huh . -- and , and my dad is actually on the school board there , 

so , I kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on . Yeah , it 's Plano , uh , improved greatly in the last twenty , twenty-five years -- Yeah . -- that 's for sure . It used to be the pits . And Arlington is excellent now , but I 'm just speaking overall -- Oh . -- across the country . Yeah . Something is definitely wrong . Uh-huh . And , uh , one thing , they do n't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing , so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year 

and they truly ca n't read -- Right . -- so I do n't know how they expect them to , uh , pass history when they ca n't read anything , you know , even read a word problem in math . So , um , that 's definitely a problem . Another problem is you 're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do . Right . But , um , So do you , what do you think is good about the schools ? That is good about , well , it depends on where you are . They 're all so different . That 's another thing -- Yeah . -- about the United States . There 's no national curriculum , you know , 

I mean , what they 'd be teaching in an Arlington school they may not be teaching in a Plano school -- Uh-huh . -- and in the same school district , you may , even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance , you may have an English class you may have half literature for the whole year , whereas in another one they 're going to concentrate on grammar -- Grammar . -- and give you a little literature , it 's up to the teacher , in other words . 

So that 's kind of o , you know , that 's kind of odd to me . Yeah . It depends on , uh , what school you 're in and who your teacher is , actually -- Uh-huh . -- or is how you end up . Overall , Arlington is good , one of the better ones in the state , so I guess we lucked out when we moved here . Uh-huh . So , yeah , 

that 's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you . Uh-huh . Of course we have a slight problem in that , uh , the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point , and , uh , you know , where our kids might be in a great school , we 're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they ca n't read , you know . Uh-huh . So . But do you think that there should be , um , nationwide , um , curriculum ? I do n't know . I just read about that the other day , and I had never even thought of it . Actually it makes sense to a certain extent , because sometimes , like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that did n't even learn what , uh , they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach , you know . Uh-huh . MUMBLEx and according to her plan , so I guess if there was a national curriculum we 'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn . Right . 

But , uh . We actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes , you know . Um . That 's , that 's pretty low that there 's -- Yeah . -- forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more peop- , more citizens percentage wise that can read and write , so , um , unless we want to keep paying , paying for these people that ca n't make it in society , we 're going to have to do something . I do n't know . Obviously nobody 's smart enough to have figured it out yet , so I probably ca n't . But I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five , six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write -- -- because they ca n't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays -- Right . -- you know . Uh , you ca n't , you ca n't even work an answering machine if you 're at work and had to get a message or something , you know , or fill out an application to work at McDonalds if you ca n't read . Uh-huh . So , uh , I think that 's , that 's a start at least , going back to the basics in the early grades -- -- and , um , they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago , and that 's a big jump . Yeah I believe that . Did you go to school in Plano ? I did . Through high school . Uh-huh , 

uh , kinder- ,
