Okay . Tell me about your home . Well , it 's an older home . It was made back in the early sixties . It 's a pier beam house . Huh-uh . Got three bedrooms , one bath and that just makes me scream . That 's pretty tough . What area do you live in ? I live in Houston . Oh , okay . I see . Is that pretty typical for your area ? Well , for the neighborhood I 'm in , 

yeah , Yeah . This is one of the more established neighborhoods , Huh-uh . That sounds real interesting . I live in a suburb of Dallas and , uh , I live in the basic three bedroom , two bath home . So , at least , I have two bathrooms . That 's not so bad , but , uh , it 's pretty typical for the area , as well . Uh , I 've always been interested in older homes , personally . So , I think you can end up doing more with them , it seems like . What about yard space ? Do you have lot of , a big lot , or anything like that ? The whole lot I 'm sitting on is roughly half an acre . Oh , I see . 

About half of that , about a quarter acre of that , I 've got a garden . Huh-uh . Oh , that 's nice . Because I have just like a very small , you know , those basic tract houses , like that . We have a very small yard and , um , I do have garden , but it 's extremely small , but , uh , it seems like , though , for your area that , that is sort of different . In a big city like that most houses , I would think , would be sort of like what we live in . Just a you know , basic tract house . 

Well , in the , uh , newer neighborhoods and development communities , the houses are so close together , Yeah . if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow . That 's exactly right . That 's the way we are . We have , uh , one thing we have that we really enjoy here , is we have a hot tub in the back . So we have , we have quite a few parties , and uh , seems like everyone that lives around us , ends up , you know , hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone . So , uh , that 's true that is one thing that I do n't enjoy about it , is the houses are too close together . But , uh , you know , it 's fine for now , hopefully , eventually , we 'll move in a larger home . The only thing that I do n't like also is the rooms are so small . You know , it 's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that , so . Are your rooms in your house bigger since it 's a sixties home ? Because it seems like then , that they built the homes much larger 

is that true ? Yeah . And they 've got better closet space . Yeah . MUMBLEx new houses that I 've seen . Yeah . Yeah . That 's really it . That 's a plus . At least we do have like three walk-in closets here . So that 's , that 's maybe not so typical , but , uh , It helps a bunch . Yeah . It really does , except when you have to fill them up and then you get those Visa bills in . 

And , Yeah . So anyway , um , anything else about the area , about , um , you know , can you compare yourself to any thing around there . Most of the neighborhood I 'm in is pretty typical . This whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixty-five . Yeah . So it 's , it 's , Everybody has got a MUMBLEx , pretty good size yard , Yeah . I mean , I got probably the biggest , 

if not the biggest yard , I 've got pretty close to it , Yeah . in the entire neighborhood . That 's nice . That is nice . But , you know , too , the only bad thing , too , is that then you have to keep up , you know , 

you have to , Well , I , the yard to deal with and , I enjoy that though . Do you . You must have more time than , than I have . I 'm sitting out here right now . We had this terrible rain and I 'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten and it seems like now that 's , that 's , I almost wish I was in an apartment or something . You know , It 's rained MUMBLEx . Yeah . Well , um , I do n't know , do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time ? 

Do you know ? No , we can , after you go to somewhere between five and ten minutes , they 'll get a little master recording on , Okay . this . Okay . Well , can you tell me anything else about the house . Are you working on it ? I mean , do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation ? Yeah . This entire neighborhood , everybody keeps the places up real nice . Yeah . That 's , that 's nice . Yeah , the town that I came from is , uh , is a , uh , older town , it like , 

the typical , the typical homes there are like , you know , early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds , Wow . and I renovated a house there and that was so much fun . I mean , there , if you do n't live in a house that 's at least seventy-five to hundred years old , you know , you 're just nobody , practically . And that was really , that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline and , uh , MUMBLEx was considered typical for that area . So , uh , it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that 's just , you know , a very square little box and , you know , there 's not a whole lot you can do with it . 

But , uh , anyway , Living in the city has some advantages . Yeah . That 's true . If given the choice , I 'm getting out . Oh , really . Well , I have lived in a small town for , you know , this , this town was like less than ten thousand people and it was about sixty miles south of Dallas . And , you know , I did n't move out of there until I was , you know , twenty-seven and that was just , you know , so I love the big city . You know , I had lived in a rural area for , for so long so I 've enjoyed it , but , uh , it can , it can get kind of tough . 

Its like a rat race sometimes . That 's just something I 'll never adapt to . I do n't , I do n't want to be a part of the rat race . I want to be basically just kind of left alone . Yeah . If I want to sit around and mess with my garden , I 'll mess with my garden , Yeah . if I want to work in the flower beds , Yeah . It sounds like you enjoy working outside as well . 

I , I , Very much . yeah . I really do enjoy that . But I have n't planted anything yet or , you know , I usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo , but I , I have n't done that , yet . I 've had finals this week . So , uh , Huh-uh . you know , I 'm just kind of trying to , trying to stick in with that , but , uh , since that 's over with now , maybe I can , I can get this yard in shape . 

Do you do a lot of gardening ? Uh , landscaping is more , than the gardening , Yeah . in the garden I 've got my beans , peas , Yeah . I 've got some onions out , Yeah . tomatoes , 

I 'm not real sure what they 're going to do this year . I never have much luck with tomatoes . I do plant a lot of beans , because it seems like , the , uh , bugs get on them so easily and I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that , so , the only thing that I use is soap . I water , you know , spray the plants , because they say , supposedly , that will keep the bugs off them . But , uh , I do n't have luck with that tomato plant , so I hate to spray them with anything . Um , what do you do ? 

Do you have any tips you could give me ? Um , my favorite one is putting on the , um , tomato plant is to put , uh , MUMBLEx dust , Yeah . Yeah . and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time , That 's true . That 's true . My dad is a farmer so , I 've heard him talk about that forever . I guess it works , but , um , you have to really wash your vegetables after that so it wo n't make you sick . 

Let 's see what else do you do to your house ? Well , I 've done some rewiring on it . Yeah . Eventually , if we stay here , I 'm going to have to rewire the entire house . Oh , really . Do you plan on like adding any rooms or , you have enough space you could probably do that . Or is it , I 've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on . Yeah . I would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms , that 's tough . Do you not , like , have a half bath . Not even a half bath . Yeah . Yeah . That 's rough . The house that I used to live in had one bath and a half . And that was even just with two people . That was a pain . The only thing that saves it , with the schedule I work and the schedule my wife works , we 're getting ready to go to work at totally different times . That 's good . So that . It 's not like we 're tripping over each other in the morning . Really . That could account for a lot of marital problems . I think . You get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom . It does n't work if you 're trying to shave and she 's trying to put her eyeliner on and , No . you 're both fighting over the mirror . That 's right . It does not make for a happy situation . That 's true . Well , do you have any children ? I 've got one . One child . And they enjoy where they 're living ? We 'll , he 's nine months old . Oh , so he does n't know , right . I guess , he 's a big help out in your garden . Right . He likes to dig around a little bit . His mother comes in and says , why did you let him play in the dirt , I guess he 's enjoying himself . That 's right . It 's healthy , why not . Yeah . He was eating the dirt , I would n't worry about it . No . It wo n't hurt them . I was a big dirt eater , supposedly , when I was a child and I turned out okay , so , do n't worry about it . Just let him enjoy himself . So you think that you want to move away from the big city , uh ? Well , that 's what I 've always , I was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people . Yeah . So you 're just the opposite from me . You want to go back to that , uh , After we got married we moved , ended up moving to the Houston area . Yeah . Yeah . So are you from Texas ? Yeah . You are . So it 's not , you know , that 's true Houston , in itself , is a pretty tough place .
