Go ahead . Uh , have you every been tested for a new job or anything ? Uh , no I have n't . But , in my job , I 'm a nurse , and we are allowed to be . I mean , you know , this is the rules that they can do this anytime . Uh , I do n't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested . So it 's just sort of , uh , they can if they , They can if they choose to . 

Oh , okay . Right . Have you , well wai- , have you had any experience with it at all ? Uh , not really but I 've always worked on a university level but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff . Uh-huh . So what do you think about that ? Uh , I do n't , I do n't think they 're very accurate because , I mean , I know their lifestyles changed p- , prior to the drug test 

and I know they changed afterwards . Right , right . See I know of that too . And I also know that things like antihistamines , Sudafeds , things like that , can really throw it off . And you can not get a job because of it Yeah , I , I had a friend , it did n't cause her any problems with her job 

but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen . Uh-huh . But what it was , was she had been u- , she had been , uh , in the jungle and it was some Malaria medication 

and she tested positive for that . See , and so it really is a dangerous thing that way because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and did n't get the job and they were n't told why . But a lot of people say the reason why , after you take a physical , will be because of the drug testing or they would tell you . Or this person never use any drugs . See , I always , I thought they got , you got called back if you tested positive , for more tests . Uh , you should . Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something . I have real mixed feelings about it . 

I do n't know . How , do you know how wrong they are ? Are they , I mean , is there a margin of error ? The accuracy ? I do n't know . I do n't know . But , I know there are a lot of things that can influence them 

and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time . Yeah . And if you could show that , I , I interviewed for a job recently and I was taking Entex . Uh-huh . And my doctor gave me a prescription for it . And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive , you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you , you know . And it did n't come up that I needed to do it but this could happen to anybody and if they would just say oh , this person 's drug test is positive we wo n't hire them -- Yeah . 

-- you know . Then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything . Yeah . So I do n't know . And I , I 'm not so sure they are that needed . Yeah , I 'm not -- -- sure either . The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it , then they have the right to go ahead and prove it 

because they say they can spot check . Ye- , if you 're using it while at a job , I can see a problem . Yeah . But the occasional person , then it 's almost like , it 's almost an infringement of your privacy . Well , it sort of is . And this is it , this , I 'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways . You know , as a health professional , I would n't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs . Yeah . You know , so as a patient , I feel well , yeah , we probably should be protected . But , on the other hand , there 's a lot of things I should be protected from that they do n't test my patients for too . So -- Yeah . -- you know , I guess you sort of , you have to have trust some place along the way . 

You ca n't go around testing everybody for everything . Yeah . So , I do n't know . And I , I think it could be used to hassle somebody . If someone was out to get you , I think that a company or a boss could use this . You know , they could keep on doing this to you or something , I guess . I can see where it could become a problem . And it , it 's like , it seems like now they have tests I guess they can test your hair and they can find out if you use drugs -- Really . -- up to several years ago . So , -- maybe you should n't be held responsible for something you did several years ago . I know . That 's the other thing . I mean a lot of , a lot of people as kids or , you know , young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I do n't think they should really have to pay for that forever . Yeah . There 's a lot of things you do as a kid that -- Yeah . -- you would n't do as an adult but -- I think that 's true . -- you ca n't say it was wrong at the time . Yeah , yeah . 

So that probably would n't be too good either .
