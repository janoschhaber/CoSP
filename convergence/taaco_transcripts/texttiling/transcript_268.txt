Okay , well the topic is selecting care for the elderly . Uh-huh . And I do n't have elderly parents , yet but not that far in the distant future . What about yourself ? Well , my parents are both in their seventies . My , my mother and stepfather , and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies . And , my , uh , uh , father and stepmother are not in very good health . So this is something that is , A concern of yours right now . Yes , it is . 

Are , are they living independently , right now ? Yes , they are . Oh . They are . 

Have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that ? Not for them , my , my mother and stepfather have , have , uh , set up an arrangement where they have a large home and , uh , two of my sisters and , and their families , one of them 's husband and then all the children are living in this home . Its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms and , and , uh , they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen . And , and , uh , my father bought this , uh , my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care 

and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home . Oh , that sounds the ultimate . Unless , unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home . Well , even at that point , most care can be given at , in the home . That sound like just an excellent solution . 

You must feel real good about that . Well , I , I felt good about it because that 's my personal feeling also . I , uh , I read a lot and then I know people th- , then have visited nursing homes and , uh , have had great , grandparents in the nursing homes and it was not a happy situation for , for any of them . And , and , uh , we have a very active nursing home here in Plano that , that has , uh , activities going all the time and they have , uh , even the people that are wheelchair bound and , and really are , are ti- , ti- , incapacitated . Uh-huh . Go and , uh , participate in olympics and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that 's held annually at a big mall here . Right . You know , th- , so there are a lot of , a lot of activities going on all the time and this is a nursing home , it 's not a senior citizens home . 

So that the people are really , uh , Really in need of a nursing home . Right . They need , Right , uh-huh . the nursing care , and , and , but it 's a very expensive solution . Well , it 's , you know , I think we just , you know , listen to , is the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes . 

It 's just a matter of finding , Right . a good home . Right . And , and then , of course , there is always the problem of being able , able to afford either of those solutions . Right . Uh-huh . And that , I think is what is scary , and I also feel that that 's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from . Is when people have to put people in a nursing homes 

and they really can not afford the best . Right . And that 's right , I , well I took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation and , uh , they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had , had , uh , apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating . Oh . And , uh , he had apparently had not been in the home too long , just a week or so , but when they , the family came in to see him , they had not been made aware , I was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance and I overheard their conversation . 

And when the family walked in , his wife and daughter and son-in-law , they were not even aware of what had happened . Oh , goodness . So , I told them he strangled on some chicken and , uh , they said , the , the woman , the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or , Oh . so , you know , and I thought , What a shame , 

they put him in the home so that he could be cared for -- Right . Right . -- and then they could have done that well at home . And then she was upset , he had on two different shoes , one of which was not even his . He had on a pair , Oh . of slacks , and the wife said `` these are not his slacks '' and she said `` I just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean . '' And , You hear these stories , Right . all the time . Right . Well , I , this was just something that I was , You happened , I witnessed to . Right . And , and , uh , at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in . 

And we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour . Oh . And , with just a curtain , of course , between us and , and , uh , Right . th- , they re , revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth , and he was definitely , just by looking at him and the way he acted , you could tell he was in need of , of nursing home care , but the family were all talking about , uh , putting him in another home . 

They said he will not go back -- Well , good . -- to that one . Good , I 'm glad they have a solution . I 'm glad they the option . To do that , yes . I know . I , I would hate to be in a position where that was all I could afford and there were not , there was no choice . Exactly . My , uh , my ex-husband 's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for , oh , it must be seven , eight years , 

and , uh , and , uh , Oh , my . It 's just her , her condition deteriorated , deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home . Um . As the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from , Uh-huh . Uh-huh . from people who have been independent all their lives . Like this was a really neat vital woman and you get in a nursing home and the first thing that happens you have to share your , your whole living space , Right . with someone that you have never known before in your life . Right . And oh I , I do not know what the answer is , but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there and it , I think it does , a lot of it goes down to just money . That 's right . And family support , uh , if you , you know , have family that , uh , you can live with . Visits everyday . Right . Right . Right . I , I really , I think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care , you know . You would do your research and you would go visit . Visit , right . And , uh , hopefully , they would have , they would have it so that you could go there anytime . Right . Because if you could not go there anytime , then that would make you , Suspicious . a little bit su- , right . You know , I , I , my , I remember my , my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died and I guess there was not a name for what she had at that time , but I guess Alzheimer 's would come as close as anything , she really was not aware of what she was doing . Uh-huh . And , uh , I ca , I can remember she had several strokes and the nursing home was right next to a hospital and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days . 

And it was , she was , it was just like keeping something .
