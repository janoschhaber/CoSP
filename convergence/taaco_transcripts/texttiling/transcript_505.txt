So how do you get most of your current event information ? Well , MUMBLEx , see I 'm going to school right now , and , uh , -- Uh-huh . -- while I 'm working , I do n't get a , I do n't get a chance to read the paper a lot , and I do n't watch T V as much really either , because , uh , my free time is kind of , 

and I do , like to do other stuff with it . Right . While I 'm at work sometimes , I , on the computer network -- Uh-huh . -- um , I read the news sometimes , and that 's kind of helpful . I would imagine going to college , though , your professors and different things , you keep up on what 's going on . That 's true , I mean , my roommates and stuff , you know -- Yeah . -- people around me talk about it . And the people I work with are pretty , you know , up , up-to-date on that kind of stuff , so . Right . Well , I 'm a housewife , I have three kids , and so -- Uh-huh . 

-- um , I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock -- Yeah . -- and then , um , talking with people and just hearing what 's going on . MUMBLEx . Do you watch , do you watch the network , like major network news , or do you watch like -- Just the regular channel -- -- the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR ? -- just channel eight . Oh , really . That 's our channel here 

that 's the , um , eyewitness news . Uh-huh . So . Oh , ch- , see channel , where I am channel eight 's , um , like public T V , so it 's kind of different . Oh , uh-huh . Yeah . I think , I think the , uh , I think a lot of the commentators on , like the major networks , like right , it 's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on , 

but , um , it seems that , um , they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they , you know , report on the news . Right . And I think even in the elections , they choose who they 're going to follow and who they 're not , and basically -- Yeah . 

-- you know , if a candidate can get them to follow , then the news will , you know , kind of publicize his name . Yeah , exactly . I do n't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it . I think you get a very lopsided picture of what 's going on . Uh-huh , because they can , they can only report on , I mean , they give each candidate perhaps , you know , ten second blurbs in which to , you know , to say , you , you just ca n't get a full picture of , you know -- Right . 

-- their message unless you have time to sit down and r , and probably read something on it . Right . And the news , too , it just does n't , um , cover that many stories , I mean , it just covers your basic , you know , violent crimes -- Yeah . -- and , you know , and , and your ca- , catastrophes with weather and stuff , 

but other than that , you really do n't know what 's going on . Yeah . Um , I will read our current letters that come out on elections and , I guess I do read that , and I do study who 's running in our area , and I do study what 's going on in the economy . It , you know , 

and , I guess I do read other magazines , um , too , to get my information . What kind of , see , I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS , and that 's , that 's real good because it gives like a brief summary of , or like the updates , like of what 's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would , you know , bog me down that I would n't know about -- Right . -- but other than that I do n't really read , 

I do n't , I do n't really subscribe to anything else . I used to read every month a READER 'S DIGEST -- Uh-huh . -- but , um , now I guess I just have friends that clip articles or if I , you know , am interested in something , of course , during the w- , when we were in war , I read up on that just a little in the newspaper -- Oh , yeah . -- to find out what was going on . But a lot of the times , I , you know , I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper , but I just ca n't seem to find the time . Yeah . If they put it out in a video , or on , not a video but a cassette tape or something , where you could just listen to it -- Yeah . -- I would do that while I was doing other things . But , Well , I remember back during the , uh , during the war , everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on , because that , they were going constantly with that stuff . Right . But , uh . Well , I , um , they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of , and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news . You know , we just do n't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas -- Yeah . -- that we want to hear what 's going on with the economy , what 's being done to help it , what 's going on in other countries , what 's , you know , just more information . If they reported every , if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take , it would probably take the whole news hour . Yeah . But , uh . Well , I guess we 'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the , uh , summer olympics . Oh , yeah , that 's , they start , already they 're having like , um , in the newspaper they have a section , I think , every now and then , on the Olympics , you know , and they 've got like a countdown , it 's like sixteen hundred days or something . I know , we 're trying to get tickets to it right now . Oh , really ? Yeah . That 's going to be crazy that time of year here . But , uh . Yeah . I ca n't believe , I mean , they 're , they 're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over , I guess people want to hear about it . Also big in the news right now is the Braves , because they 're , uh , they 're in , you know , tr- , spring training or whatever -- Right , right . -- and they did so well last year . Yeah , they spent a lot of time , that 's another thing , they spend a long time on sports , and I think that , um , that 's fine , I would like to see more time spent on other things . Yeah . But . It seems like , I do n't know , they way they do the newscasts , I wish they , they kind of separated it , you know , if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it but I do n't have cable .
