Okay , well what do you do on your yard ? Well , uh , typical lawn stuff . Saint Augustine , uh -- Uh-huh . -- with a little Bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas -- Uh-huh . -- uh , and really all I do to it is , uh , in fact , I did n't even fertilize it this year , I just mowed it , 

and I , I mow it , uh , you know , with a mulch mower so the , the particles fall down -- Comes back in the yard -- -- Yeah . -- so you do n't have any one do your yard . You do it yourself ? I do it myself . Yeah , we do too . Have a lot of people trying to do it for me . Is n't that the truth . A flyer 's on every door every day . Hey , I need the exercise , so what the heck . That 's right . Well , we , um , we , my husband does the same thing , he does the yard , and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower , 

but I keep putting off learning . Hey , you 've got the right idea . That 's right . But I had recently gone out and planted mums . We had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago , and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway 's -- Uh-huh . -- and put out yellow and bronze and they 're just gorgeous , and so then last week my mom comes in town , 

and she says Well , those are going to die just the first frost . She said , You should have done pansies . And I went , Well , now you tell me . Yeah . So the first night , that around Halloween and we went out and covered them with a sheet , and they did okay that first night . But the second night we were at the movies and did n't do it , so I guess I 've lost them . I have n't gone out to check yet . Yeah , I do n't blame you . I would n't want to look at them . No , listen , but , um , the worst problem we 've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here . I guess it was about four years ago . And we did not know in August to put down the , uh , whatever it is for grub worms . Uh-huh . And the next spring , I guess in that March , every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed , we 'd have big whole patches come up . Have you ever seen it -- Yeah . -- what grub worms do ? Yeah . And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it , it would just come off in the rake , down to the dirt . So we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything . It took a lot of money and a lot of time , so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazinon . Yeah , you , you think that 's what it was , huh . Oh , yeah , we found them -- Okay . -- yeah we found them . We dug under there about an inch and you could see them . They 're real fat little white things , and -- Yeah . -- they said they turn into black bugs in the spring -- Yeah , those kind of brown , uh , Ju- , -- yeah , but in , but in the , What we call June bugs -- Uh-huh . -- and some people call them May beetles . Yeah , June bugs is what I 'd heard them called , so any how , occasionally I find them in the flower beds . They said that every yard has some -- Uh , yeah . -- but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem . So that 's the number one thing we do , whether we fertilize or anything else , just because we got burned so badly before . Yeah , well , I had some of that problem , but mine was freeze . Oh , yeah that too , two years ago , or last Christmas -- Yeah , yeah . -- is that what you 're talking about ? Yeah , I 'm still -- Yeah , uh-huh . -- I 'm still replacing that in the back , especially , under the trees -- Uh-huh . -- uh , you know , kind of slow , and , as you say , very expensive . Yeah . I caught Wolfe with , uh , uh , one , uh , one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents , and , uh -- Oh , yeah . -- I bought about twenty of them . I guess you did too . It 's what they 've done in the spring -- Uh , well , I put , you know -- -- or the fall . -- that was late , that was like , Yeah , because I started to say , you can , there 's different times they say it 's okay to do it . Yeah , that was like September , I think . Yeah . And I had to water it , you know -- Yeah -- -- gosh . -- keep it damp . Well , my , out here , you know , we do n't have as many trees in Plano , at least the area where , we 're over by Collin Creek Mall , and , but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front , like the pittosporum all died , and all those variegated , uh , things died . So we pretty much go with that dwarf Yaupon and that Yaupon holly , and they just live , Yeah , they 're pretty tough , uh , Yeah , you can , you can stand those . Pittosporum is kind of borderline here -- Uh-huh . -- and usually it 'll do pretty well , but , uh , you know , every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals -- Yeah . -- and it zaps it . Well it 's kind of like one of these , Oh , wax leaf , wax leaf ligustrum is the same way . Same way , uh-huh . That , they , they warned me of that one finally . And I said , You know , you need to either read Neal Sperry 's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery , because lot of places that would , are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there , and we did n't know the difference . And every year we learn one more thing that we did n't know before . Like about these mums . Yeah . Okay , next year , I 'll do pansies . Your list is growing , And my backyard , we had it really nice , and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy , and so , it was about , I guess he 's three now , so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants -- Oh , yeah , oh , gee . -- and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio . Um . So , it 's like our backyard is just kind of like , as long as he wo n't damage it , fine , and if he 'll , if there 's anything he 'll hurt , we just do n't put it out there any more . Yeah , kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds , yeah . Uh-huh . Very much , but , uh . I had a , had a small vegetable garden that , uh , You did . It did pretty well , it 's , it 's like on the -- Huh . -- side , the apron of the , of the parkway out behind the garage -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , our , our garages come in from the back , you know , from the alley -- So do ours , yeah . -- and , uh , it 's , it 's a little piece of land over there . What did you grow ? Well , I had , uh , tomatoes and , and , uh , uh , peppers , and I had , That is amazing . I had okra , and by the fence I had cucumbers , which , which did n't do real well , uh -- Yeah . -- they kind of came out looking like gourds . Well , put them in a salad , though , and you say , well , I made it though , at least it 's mine . But I had squash , I had zucchini and , and yellow crook neck squash ,
