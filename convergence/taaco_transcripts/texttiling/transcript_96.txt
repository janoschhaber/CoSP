Okay , what do you like to cook ? I like , well I like to cook foods I like to eat . I like to eat Italian food best . Uh-huh . And I find that I , that 's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals , type things and , Uh-huh . they 're kind of convenient . That would be good for a dinner party , that , you know , to cook that because you do n't have to deal with eight different things , Right . coming out at once . Is that what you usually cook when you have a party . Um , I usually have parties that are smaller groups . 

I do n't have , I 've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such . Uh-huh . And so , um , yeah , I guess I usually do . I like to cook , um , heavy sauces , and , um , Really , that sounds good . noodles and pasta and such . Um , fattening . Yeah , actually . How about you , what do you like to , to cook ? Uh , we , it 's funny that , um , we 're talking about this , we just had a dinner party and we had , um , our senior pastor and his wife came over . Uh-huh . And I catered to their diet is the only thing , though , so it was n't something I really wanted to make . 

I really wanted to make red beans and rice and with MUMBLEx . Oh yeah . you know , sausage , because I 'm from New Orleans originally . Uh-huh . And , um , I was going to make that , red beans and rice with the , those Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff , and , uh , well there 's salad and then for desert I would , I really wanted to make , um , just brownies or French donuts would have been good , but it 's real hard to make them . They do n't really come out like they do in New Orleans , up here , 

I do n't know why . Oh really . I do n't know if it 's me or the water or the recipe I have but , Humidity or something . um , that 's what I want . That 's what I like to make is just real neat stuff like that but . Uh-huh . Kind of like the Italian , it 's really good , but instead I catered to their diet so I made baked chicken in the crock pot and , um , it was good and everything , it had all the vegetables in it , 

but , it seemed kind of boring compared , It kind of , uh , kind of down played compared to what you would like , huh . Right . 

Do you find yourself , um , with all the , um , cholesterol and , and high fiber changing the way that you fi , that you entertain ? I find it changing the way that I eat , but not the way I entertain , because I guess , I guess I feel like if they 're on a diet like that , I 'm going to , you know , honor that , but if it 's just another couple came , um , over a couple weeks later and I made , what did I make that night . I made a roast , Uh-huh . and I made , um , uh , I ca n't believe this my husband broke the coffee pot I just bought yesterday . Oh no . I ca n't believe that . Anyway , but I asked , 

when Ricky and Carrie came over we made , um , a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit . Uh-huh . And normally I , do n't eat , we do n't eat like that during the week because of the , you know , the calories and the fat in it . Uh-huh . But you know , when we 're having guests , we just kind of say , oh just do it . And I made blueberry cobbler 

and we had extra crust with it , Yeah . it was so fattening . That sounds good . But , I do n't think we gained any weight from it so . Well , every once in a while I , I think I feel the same way . When I 'm entertaining , I do n't take that thing into consideration unless it 's really , really , like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it 's too rich simply because they do n't want the extra calories , so I think dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play , sometimes . Right , I made an apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over and she did n't eat it . Oh yeah . But I did bake apples so that it would be , not brownies , you know . I figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies . Yeah , yeah . So , um , I 've read a good brownie recipe . Oh , that 's good . But , uh , anyway , so I guess that 's about what I did when I entertained . Uh-huh . So , do you have anything else you want to say about it ? Um , nothing comes to mind right off , so I guess not . Okay , well it was nice talking to you . Okay you too . Okay , bye . 

Bye , bye .
