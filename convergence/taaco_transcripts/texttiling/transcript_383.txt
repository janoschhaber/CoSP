What 's your favorite T V show ? Oh . You know , I used to like ST . ELSEWHERE . Uh-huh . That 's one of my old favorites . Um , and that 's , I 'm being beeped , so I 'll just ignore it . Um , and now , I , I did like THIRTY SOMETHING -- Uh-huh . -- oh , yes , my daughter says NINE OH TWO ONE OH . We like that one . Yeah , 

that 's one of my favorites . Good , and how old are you ? I 'm twenty-eight . Oh , so you 're little bit younger than I am , but yeah , I think if my seventeen year old , my fourteen year old , my other two children like it , I 'm over forty , and I like it . I think it 's wonderful . Yeah , it 's a good show . I like MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN , too . Oh , yeah , now see , I , we are so busy with , all of our kids are in sports , and I hardly ever watch T V , but that 's one that , that we watch . 

And then Sunday nights we watch , uh , LIFE GOES ON . Yeah , I like that , that 's , that 's a good show , too . Very good . Did you see the one on Sunday ? Yes , it was a , uh , uh I did miss that Sunday , no I did n't . 

That one kid that Becca likes -- Yeah , it 's a good episode . -- he has AIDS . Yeah , the , the new character on there did . Right , right . All the way to North Carolina . What time is it there ? Uh , it is twenty minutes to nine . Oh , my gosh . See , I 'm twenty minutes to six here . Three hours difference . Yeah , yeah . Okay . 

What else do you like ? Uh , let 's see , I like a lot of different shows . Let 's see , um , I like MURDER , SHE WROTE . That 's , that 's , Oh , I never , I never watched that ever in my entire life . And MATLOCK is another good one I watch . Uh-huh . Um , then during daytimes I like , I like ALL MY CHILDREN . A small bowl will be plenty . Oh , that 's mine . That 's the only one I watch whenever I , oh , a small bowl will be better because it 's pretty fattening . Talk to my daughter . 

Um , um , ALL MY CHILDREN , I 've watched that for about twelve years . Yeah , I 've , I 'm sure I watched it for more than that probably . Twenty something . I used to watch GENERAL HOSPITAL when I was a teenager because I , I quit watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed . Oh . So that was a long time ago . I used to watch it , was in high school and college -- Right . -- when Laura 's mother got killed . She was my favorite character on there . I just , I read the reason she got , they , they killed her off was because they could n't settle a contract , and I said , well , if they 're going to do that to her , I wo n't watch it . Oh , that 's great . Well , I do like ALL MY CHILDREN , and I , and I like it , you know , I do n't know . I just , I like the people on it , I guess , you know . I , I , I like it . I just wish they 'd bring some of the old characters back . Yeah , well , Tad 's going to come back , I bet , do you think ? Yeah , I 'm sure he will . He 'll come back , show up at just the right moment . I kind of wish that , uh , Nina would come back because she -- Oh . -- because the story , you know , just for a brief visit or whatever , because it never has been resolved with Palmer remarrying , and everything , Yeah , like Daisy , pops in once in a while , and , I forgot about Nina and Cliff , right . Yeah , Cliff 's on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS now . Oh , he is . So he 's out for good . Yeah , he 's out for good . Did they marry ? Uh -- Nina and Cliff ? -- that 's how they left the show , but not in real life . Um . Now she 's married to some guy in New York , and she 's happily married and that 's the reason she left the show . I guess she wanted a private life . Oh , okay , oh , see I , I , I watch it maybe twice a month , so , I do n't watch it everyday like I did when I had babies . Oh , well , I , I watch . Because I play lots of tennis and I 'm gone a lot , so , I do n't get to watch , I watch it everyday , religiously . I videotape it when I have to miss it . Oh , no kidding . Yeah . I use to be , I used to be like that . I 'm that way about a lot of different shows . I 'm that way about MURPHY BROWN , DESIGNING WOMEN . Now is n't DESIGNING WOMEN , do n't they have a new chick on there instead of the , instead of what 's her name ? Uh , yeah , there 's two new characters on there . There 's , um , uh , Jan Hooks from SATURDAY NIGHT LIFE . I do n't know if you know her or not . Huh-uh . That 's a show I like . And then , and then , uh , , uh , the blond headed girl that used to be on NEWHART . Oh , yeah , oh . I do n't like her on it , I never have liked her , so . Well , I , I just know which one she is . I do n't , you know . She 's taken the Suzanne 's part , and then Jan Hooks has taken Charlene 's part . Charlene was Delta Burke ? Charlene was Jean Smart , the blond headed . Oh , okay , well , see , I never watch that one either . I really do n't watch a whole lot of T V , just , you know , on Sunday nights , LIFE GOES ON comes on about the time that we eat dinner , and my whole family 's home , because I do n't allow the kids out on Sunday night -- Yeah . -- you know , because they 've got to go to bed and go to school the next day , and so we , we sit around and eat popcorn and , oh , then we watch AMERICA 'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS . Those are always pretty cute . Well , MURDER , SHE WROTE comes on opposite of that , and so , Oh , so you do n't watch that one -- Yeah I -- -- instead of , -- I pick nights pretty much so on T V that I watch different networks , but -- Sure . -- BEVERLY HILLS NINE OH TWO ONE OH , I , I watch it religiously . Yeah , we like that real well . It , be sure to watch it tomorrow night -- Uh-huh . -- because somebody 's getting killed on it . I know . The kids already know who it is , I do n't know who it is , though , Who is it ? Ask them . Let me ask Nicole . Nicole .
