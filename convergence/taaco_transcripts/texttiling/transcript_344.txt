Well I did hear the end of the prompt this time . Was that you , that we did n't hear the whole prompt ? Yes , Yes , And it said that what , what do we , do we think that cri- , certain crimes should fit certain punishments , 

and , uh , I was thinking about it after I got off the phone , that , that I really , you know , wish that there was some way to , uh , send a message to people , you know , about , um , child abuse and things like that -- Uh-huh . -- that , uh , those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment . 

Too often I feel that people get off , uh , without , Yeah , I , I agree with you , although I will say , I 'm not sure , you know , I sometimes have a problem with some of the , especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have , you know , was , was because they were abused a , abused as children . And the parents are saying , Hey , wait a minute , we did n't do anything like that -- Uh-huh . -- you know , and , and , and I guess before I 'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it it has to be a , an absolute certainty -- Uh-huh . -- you know , like , uh , caught at it , or something -- Right , right , -- you know , or if they , they , uh , you know , severely beat up on a child , or , you know , I would have absolutely no problem at all -- Yeah , -- you know , with , with , I do n't buy the routine , oh they 're just sick , or they were abused when they were little -- Uh-huh . -- well , you know , forget that . Yeah , well , sometimes they even wonder when , when , uh , criminals plead temporary insanity for , for punish- , for crimes that are so severe -- Uh-huh . -- and then , you know , they get sent to a mental institution and they play loony for a while , and then they 're back out in public . Well , but I ca n't see that either . I do n't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent ag- , uh , you know -- Yeah . -- reason to not use capital punishment . Yeah , oh , I agree , I agree , because we , I think , uh , I think if I wanted to badly enough , I could convince somebody , uh , I was crazy , so , my family may say that on occasion , who knows Uh-huh . Yeah , yeah , well , and too , you know , they can always be blaming the other person , well , she looked like my mother who abused me when I was a child , or -- Uh-huh . -- something , which I think is , unfortunate for that person -- Uh-huh , -- and yet should n't be an excuse . I guess , you know , a lot of , and I was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved and , That 's the new one . Is that the new , I just happened to see the headline on it , and I did n't , could n't realize if it was the husband or the father or what , but I thought , uh , you know , if these things , if children are being abused , I , I 'm wondering how our school system is failing , that they 're not even seeing this , you know , if it was that severe that when they 're later in life adults , that it 's all of a sudden affecting them in this way , that it was n't shown up at all when they were younger , and that kind of , that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having , you know , to , to deal with that yet , but still . Well , you , you 're right , uh , and yet , I mean , did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this ? Never -- No , -- and I lived in California -- MUMBLEx . -- which I feel like California , you know , anything can go on in California . Ye- , well , yes , I , but I was from conservative Wisconsin , and , uh , you know , there was , there was , nothing on it , which makes me wonder , you know , if it 's as , uh , prevalent as , as some of them claim . Yeah . It , uh , it , it , it 's , you just do n't know , and it all , unless they 're caught in the act or the- , the- , the child is very badly , you know , beaten up , it comes down to a one word against the other -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- that type thing . Now , Texas , is capital punishment for , it used to be just capital murder , and now the- , they added mass murder . Are those the only two things that we , uh -- I really would have no idea . I , um , I do n't , do n't really know . -- uh , you know , because I have a feeling it is , and I , I think there ought to be more things added to it . Uh-huh -- Uh , -- that would be pretty lenient in my opinion . Yeah , I , I think that 's , I , you know , uh , killing a child , or kidnapping , uh , and possibly not , well , I guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt , you know , if they release them two hours later , he probably does n't deserve the death penalty , Yeah , that 's , that , or like when , uh , I 've heard when I ,
