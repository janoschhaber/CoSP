Okay , uh , let 's see , I , I believe in the trial by jury . I think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for , uh , payoffs , you know , briberies , uh , unfairness , one-sidedness , you know , all those kinds of things . And I also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent , absolutely sure before you convict somebody . I , I really agree with the , uh , innocent until proven guilty theory . I think that 's , that 's a good way to do it . 

That 's about all . Well , I think , I think basically we 're in a lot of agreement , uh , in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs , uh , some kind of legal definition . Uh-huh . But for anything involving that , trial by jury certainly should be mandatory . 

Uh-huh . But there should be with our overworked , uh , judicial system , it seems to me like there ought to be a means of , of , um , not having to take everything before a full court . You know , maybe there ought to be some kind of , of , uh , MUMBLEx 

is n't there a type of word called a jury duty now . Uh-huh . Really . And maybe instead of , of , uh , just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do , maybe we should commit to spend a week , and during that week you 're kind of an ad hoc , let 's hear about it , group of , I do n't know , twenty-five instead of twelve -- Uh-huh . -- and each case is presented to that group of twenty-five , and those cases are , uh , lesser degrees of magnitude . You know , the guy was caught burgling , 

and he had his pockets full of stuff , you know , when he was caught -- Right . -- you know , that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say , your pleasure your honor , and there 's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing . Yeah . But the way our system , our court system works , that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time . Right . I just think our system is overworked , 

and we 're starting to stretch the true meaning of , of right to a speedy trial . Yeah , that 's , that 's a good idea . Maybe this pre group of people could decide , you know , which kind of , uh , you know , where they could go from there . Do they need a big lengthy twelve person ju- , jury or do they need a six person jury or , you know , those kinds of things and the degree of the , of the , you know , the seriousness of it , you know , how , is this open and shut , you know , like you were saying , 

or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened . You know , a jury like that . You know , we , They could be a good idea to , that could work . You know , kind of MUMBLEx off what we 've been talking about here , uh , I believe that our , we 've become almost a litigious society where we , everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff , and -- Yeah . 

-- although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers , maybe we do n't need to do that . Uh-huh . You know , maybe , instead of being so quick to sue you , uh , if you have a disagreement with someone , instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff , maybe you nee , maybe you , and if you want to , your lawyer or your , your opponent need to go face this group of twenty-five or a judge MUMBLEx like -- Good idea . -- they have on T V -- Yeah . 

-- and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case . Yeah , right that 's , And let 's , you know , let 's get rid of some of this harassment suing . Right , that 's , that 's a good idea . I , in the BIBLE it says , uh , if you have something against somebody , to go to them first , and if that does n't work , then to go get somebody , you know , a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them , and if that does n't work , to take it to the whole church . 

So that 's right off that same kind of principle . You bet , and if , That 's a , that 's a good idea . If we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we would n't have half the , Yeah , that 's true , that 's true , too . But , uh , you know , that whole Biblical concept like that , that 's true in a lot of our , um , you know , the , the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that . It does n't work on that , but it 's based out of that . 

And , uh , so that , you know , that could work , Yes , I 'd forgotten what that 's called . There 's a , a real name for that like the Judean law , or something like that . Um , what is that called ? The Judeo-Christian ethic . Judeo-Christian ethic . Well , that may be right . It 's in there some place . Yeah . I think we both know that we 're talking about -- Right . -- the foundation of our legal society . Right , right . Uh , and , too , the , that was sort of the beginning of , Ye shall be treated fairly . Uh-huh . Uh , I guess the Lord started out with , we 'll treat you fa- , I 'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what I say . Uh , that 's sort of the Old Testament version . Yeah , that 's , that 's , I know , I did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament -- Really . -- where , where there 's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there 's a loving Lord in the New Testament . But that 's a whole different subject . Really , really , yeah . Okay , well , I , I think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge -- Mine , too . -- on , on the legal system . Yeah , mine , too . But it 's been a pleasure talking with you . Yeah , same here . What , what part of the country are you from ? I 'm living here in Texas . Oh , okay , in , in Texas . Okay , I was just being curious . Okay . Well , that 's quite all right . Yeah , well , I 'm from the Dallas area . Well , so am I . Oh , okay , well , that 's , that 's neat . In fact , I 'm at work out at Lewisville . Oh , are you really ? Wow . Okay , well , I 'll let you go . And it was nice talking to you . My pleasure . Have a good day . You too . Bye-bye . 

Bye .
