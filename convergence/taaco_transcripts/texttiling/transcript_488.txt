Okay . So how do you just figure MUMBLEx , Well , you know , it depends upon our weather here . You know , today was a beautiful day it was like , uh , uh , summer day . It was seventy degrees so -- Wow . -- so I dressed in , uh , uh , a light weight skirt , it 's a , uh , ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater , cardigan -- Uh-huh . -- over it . Because I had some appointments at the office today , some interviews and so I had to dress up anyway 

and then I wore heels , you know . Uh-huh . But when it rains a lot , which is has been doing here a lot lately , uh , very often , you know , wear , uh , pants and boots -- Oh . -- you know . So how do you dress ? Well , um , I 'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I was working at now . Okay . Um , when I was a teacher , um , in Utah , I would generally wear , um , dresses and heels and things like that , Uh-huh . and even when it , um , rained and snowed I just braved it and I wore heels anyway . Yeah . And , I , I can see , I , I 've been a teacher so has my daughter 

and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that , I know , it was tiring . it might kill you to go up and , That 's right . walk up to the door but you 're going to look nice for the kids . That 's right and it always makes you feel like you 're a bigger person than the kids , right ? Oh , oh , yeah . Well , I need all the height I can get . Yeah , I do too . 

So to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades , Oh , yeah . uh , older grades , I had to wear heels . Uh-huh . Yeah , we too . Um , if it was real- , it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots 

but then I would change , um , into heels , Uh-huh . as soon as I got to my desk . So , um , Of course , we wear , uh , an unlined boots , you know , it has a heel on it . They 're the kind of boots that I wear to work and we wear them , you know , they 're a leather boot that you wear 

and as I said they have a regular heel on them , high heel . Oh . And they wear them , we wear them a lot with shirts and things . Uh , it 's kind of a , I ca n't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots . They 're not a cowboy boot , but they 're just a real pretty boot , but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain . Oh . As I have a private high school that I run here and so when I 'm interviewing a parent , of course I feel like I need to wear heels -- Sure . Uh-huh . -- you know , and look like I 'm a business person . Uh-huh . Yeah . You know , because the children will tease about where 's your motorcycle , if you wear boots too often , you know . Huh . Well , um , Of course , you probably wear coats a lot . Yeah , um , the first two years I was in a room where they did n't heat it . So I did , Oh , my goodness so then you had to . Yeah , and then the third year we , um , got heating so it was nice . Yes . Then things improved , right ? Right , uh-huh . But of course , here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know , you know , Oh , that 's nice . and , uh , that 's very seldom we , it depends upon our winter . We have a few days you might wear a coat , winter coat , you know , but most of the time you can wear a sweater and we just do n't wear coats much . We often laugh about even when it turns chilly . We 're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we 're so used to running around like that . Uh-huh . Oh . Nice . Well , It 's really different . Let 's put it that way . Are you not teaching anymore ? Uh , no , we , we moved to Iowa and , um , I 'm working at a day care right now . I see . And so the way I dress is really different because I 'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months . Oh , so you do n't wear heels anymore I 'll bet . Yeah , I wear , uh , tennis shoes , Yeah , uh-huh . and jeans and things that , you know , are sort of , um , More practical . not , yes , it does n't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something . When you were teaching , did you ever have , uh , uh , a blue jean day or anything like that ? Yeah , but I never wore jeans because , um , I thought that was too casual . Yeah , well , For , I know that some of the schools they have , uh , country western day or something like that one , you know , or tacky day , and I always thought it was kind of out of , got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too . Yeah , really . It 's all right for the students , they look tacky a lot but I did n't think teachers should , you know . Yeah , that 's how I feel too . Yeah . Do you like , uh , uh , Iowa ? Um , oh , it , there 's some good things about it but I 've seen . A lot of things I 'm not used to yet , um , Where did you live before ? Um , we lived in Utah before and , and I grew up in California . Oh , well , that 's quite a change from California to Utah ,
