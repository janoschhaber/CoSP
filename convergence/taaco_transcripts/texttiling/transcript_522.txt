Okay , Eric . Uh , are you married and do you have a family ? Uh , yes I am to , uh , both questions . Okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances . Uh , yeah we do . We , uh , uh , basically there 's the , you know , the expenses that are fixed during the month -- Uh-huh . -- you know the ones that come every , every month and we , uh , enter those into , uh , into a spread sheet 

and , uh , whatever is left , uh , after that we , you know , we sit down and agree on kind of what , what sort of range we are going to -- Uh-huh . -- generally going to shoot for . I see . Uh , So what do you do ? Well , that 's basically what we do . Uh , about every , every three months or so , we re-evaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest -- Uh-huh . -- and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks . I work part time at night -- Wow . -- and he works , and my husband works full times days and so we have four checks , but that works out nice because we get paid every week and -- Yeah . -- so that does help , that helps a lot . And then , uh , we do n't have a lot ex , extra for extra spending , so it 's pretty well ear marked . Yeah . All allocated out . . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Every penny is ear marked but , uh it , we have found that works the best and and so if we can just divide them up , all the major bills up . In fact , we found it easier to divide the major bills up , you know , cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half , but and divide those up between all , uh-huh . All the checks , yeah . And so we are not taking a huge sum out , out of one and then the next pay check we 're real short or , Right . Yeah , we found that , uh , it 's definitely helped , uh , get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses . That 's true . We were , before we started doing that kind of a thing , we were , uh , spending , uh , money for things that , you know , we kind of tended to eat out a bit more -- Uh-huh . -- than we should have , and it was easy to , uh , let things get out of hand . We thought it , uh , thought it to be really helpful . We have gotten some of our loans paid off really -- Yeah . -- because of this and stuff like that so , Well , it helps you to focus where your money goes -- Yeah -- and and I am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget , but you 're wondering my , when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you 're saying , my word where did all that money -- That 's a lot of money , but , -- go . Where does it go ? Yeah . Uh -- But , -- and also we have found that if we write down , and we did this . We are not real consistent with this , but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought when , you know , every pay check -- Uh-huh . -- and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend and like I say we have n't been real consistent with it . It 's , we should cause it does help . Yeah , the other , the other thing that that we 've found that helps is , you know , we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit -- Uh-huh . -- it 's just to , uh , uh , get up the money in advance and put it in , uh , uh , so long as it was n't you know , unreasonably high , but for things like food expenses -- Uh-huh . -- or whatever . Just put it in uh , in an envelope or whatever Wel- , just stick to that , uh-huh . That is , if the entertainment amount was gone -- Yeah . That -- -- for the month say , oh , it 's gone . -- that sounds like a really good idea . So . And it really helpful . Uh , have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet ? We , we have n't . We our our initial goal was just to retire debt , uh , completely retire debt for car payments and -- Oh , uh-huh . -- credit card -- Uh-huh . -- uh , credit card debt and all of that . We are just at a point where , where we could start thinking about it so , Oh that 's good . That 's a good feeling . Yeah . Well I , My husband just graduated from the university , uh , a year ago -- Uh-huh . -- so finally -- A student . -- finally we are getting to that point too . So , are you still going to school or , Yeah , I am actually in the , in the mas- ,
