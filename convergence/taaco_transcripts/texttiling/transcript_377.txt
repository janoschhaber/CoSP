Well , you keep up with current events ? Um , somewhat . Yeah , somewhat -- Not , -- not as well as I would like to probably -- Is that right ? -- but that 's the way it goes . Yeah , where , whereabouts in Pennsylvania . What ? Where in Pennsylvania ? Um , State College , I go to Penn State . Oh , do you , well , great . Yep . How 's , uh , well no , we 're not supposed to talk about that . 

We 're supposed to talk about current events . Right , exactly , uh . Well , I 'm a current event junkie . So I , I watch , I try to watch the news , and I read the newspaper , and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what 's going on in the world . I see . MUMBLEx . Well , what particularly are you interested in ? Well , I just , pretty , uh , little , you know , about everything . And , not -- Uh-huh . -- and then again not everything , but you know , I like to know pretty well what 's happening . 

Political things do n't interest me a great deal , except I do like to stay informed enough to , feel like I halfway vote intelligently , you know -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , other than that , uh , I just , you know , just the events that happen around the world interest me . Yeah . Stay in touch with it and know , feel like I know what 's going on . Now I have to say all three of my children , none of them are too interested in current events . I see . But I always have been -- Uh-huh . -- and I stay up with it . But , uh , how do you , how do you , uh , stay aware of most of the current events . Uh , newspaper ? Um -- T V news , or what ? -- uh , well , some of both . Uh-huh . 

I read , I read the newspapers sometimes -- Uh-huh . -- and I watch C N N , that sort of thing -- Right . -- occasionally -- Yeah , that 's good . -- and I read magazines , and such . Well , you stay up with it pretty well , then . Well , yeah , I mean , not , not that badly -- Uh-huh . -- anyway , so I am , I am interested in what 's going on , and I 'm particularly interested in certain things of course , like all the news about Haiti recently -- Uh-huh , yes , uh-huh . -- because I 've been down there -- Oh , you 've been there -- 

-- and , yeah . -- well , you would be interested in it then . Right , exactly . Yeah , uh , I follow it , you know , I do n't just read everything about it , but I 'm always aware of what 's going on like that -- Yep , -- and , uh , because it is , it 's interesting -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , I do n't know , I feel sorry for those people down there , 

they 've just been so terribly mistreated for so many , many years , you know . That 's true . I mean , They 've never really had a good leader , through Papa Doc , I mean he was -- Uh-huh . -- a terrible tyrant -- Uh-huh . -- and I think it 's been better since he died , but it 's still been bad -- Yeah . -- but , uh , even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew , uh , 

I 've read some things about him that he was , he was n't too good himself . Oh , yeah ? Yeah , he was pretty , pretty much a , he did n't mind having people bumped off for certain things , you know . Uh-huh . But , uh , I see . 

It 's , one of the reasons the U S was n't so , you know , did n't do more than they did at the time -- Uh-huh . -- because they were n't all that excited about him , although he 's probably better than a lot of them , but , uh , but then again , who , you know , those people are so used to it I guess it 's the only thing that works . Yeah , so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America ? I think it 's pretty darned good , 

I think we 're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have -- Uh-huh . -- I really do . Now , I , they sometimes they jump on it and , and , and go a little to the extreme , the media does , but , uh , but , that 's kind of understandable , because , you know , of course if you watch it more , more than once a day , I mean , it 's the same thing over and over and over and over , and I listen to the radio -- Right , right . -- so I , you hear so much , you get a little tired of it , but then again , so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day , maybe -- Yep . -- but I think the quality of our , uh , our news is just , uh , I do n't believe it could be better -- Uh-huh . -- I really do n't . Yeah , well , you know , I think it probably could be , it always could be better , but I , I do n't think so . would agree that it 's pretty good . I do n't think our news could be better . Yeah . I , I mean , I mean , what else could they do to make it better . Um . I do n't see anything that they could do . Yeah , well , I think that , um , I do n't know . Well , you always -- The , um , -- want to think everything can be improved upon -- Right . -- I understand what you 're saying , Right , I think that , But by trial and error over the years , I think they got it about as good as they 're going to get it . Well , that may be so , yeah . Uh -- I think that -- -- nothing is perfect . -- I 'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the -- Uh-huh . -- how deep they dig into things and such . Well , that 's true , I understand what you 're saying , and then again , I understand why they ca n't dig too much deeper , that 's why we have C N N . Right . C N N has the time , since that 's all they do is news -- Uh-huh . -- to dig deeper . 

Right .
