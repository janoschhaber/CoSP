Is , uh , kind of fun . It 's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now . And I grew up in an area that , uh , was just a few feet from a rather large lake , and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal . Uh , I worked for a camp for a number of years . My father was on staff there , and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats , sailboats , speedboats , you name it , they had it and we did a lot of watering , , water sports . But I think , uh , the thing I liked the best was , uh , we spent about a summer couple of guys , uh , restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real h- , big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves , or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it . If you ever got it dumped over , though , it was a mess to get back up . It was n't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it , uh , upright again . This one you had to work with . You get out of the water again and get it upright . And , uh , sailing was , was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the , the wind , as it were , tacking back and forth and , uh , more than once we 'd get out there on a really stormy day and , uh , the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and you paddle your way back in and hope it does n't start raining on you right away . And that did n't always work . We oftentimes got wet , . But , uh , it 's , it 's a nice , nice hobby to have . Nowadays I do n't think I could afford the boat or the time , nor do we live that close to a lake anymore , so things change , I guess . What are your memories of boating , 

or current , Uh , about the only memories that I have of boating , uh , my husband 's family had a , a motor boat , uh , when we got engaged and they took us out on the lake several times . And , uh , I really did enjoy that . I , I do n't know that I ever learned to drive it or anything , but , uh , we did some water skiing , of course , and , and , uh , driving around the lake in the boat and , and just the basic safety rules and things I found real interesting . Uh , you know , they , they just did n't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever . The , the laws were there 

and if you did n't obey them , uh -- Right . -- you know , there were a lot of accidents , I guess . That 's true . But , uh , I found the motor boating was real fun . Yeah , I remember learning how to ski , oh , I guess I was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen , twenty acres and it was , uh , it had a lot of , uh , turtles in it . And I got all ready to go and I was down in the water and , and set to go 

and , uh , and just as that boat took off , a turtle bit me in the middle of the back . Oh . It did n't hurt too much , but it bit enough to where I let go . And the boat went off without me and I reached back there and s , pushed him away and got out of the water a , a while and , and , uh , it did n't even leave a mark . It was just a little nibble and so I told everybody what happened 

and they go , oh , yeah , sure , you know . And so I get back down in there and , and I 'll be if he did n't do it again . This time a little earlier and , and I had let go before then and , before they took off this time and , and swatted him away . So I moved over a , a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and , uh , managed to get up . Did n't go very far , but I got up . And it , it was a nice , uh , nice long skiing career , but now I 've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me . I 've , I 've , uh , done about all I dare do on skis . You know , skiing on one and jumping around here and there and I , I , I know how you can get injured doing much more than that and I just ca n't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that . Just , uh , ca n't take the risk I did as a dumb teenager , I guess . So life just changes a little bit in that respect . I 'd kind of like , someday , to maybe end up on a pair of skis that , that does n't have a , uh , well , what they call trick skis . They 'll allow you to ski backwards . I have n't cr- , managed to get a hold on that , uh , craft yet , but , uh , That sounds like a real challenge . Yeah , it , it would be kind of nice . I had n't quite figured out , I do n't have anybody to teach me either . That 's another little thing . You need somebody to kind of tell you what to do , but , just from what I 've seen , you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick , you know . Grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around . Uh-huh . But , uh , I do n't know , maybe someday I 'll , I 'll get back to that as , after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end , weekend or something . Well , my son ,
