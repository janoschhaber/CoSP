So what movies have you seen lately ? Well , I saw , um , lately I 've seen SOAP DISH . Oh . Which was a , and that was a lot of fun . It was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things . Well , see that 's something I want to see , Yeah . that 's on my list to see . Yeah , it was , it was okay . It was not , um , not a wonderful film 

but it was , I mean it was , it was cute but not the biggest laugh I 've seen . Oh , okay . I saw THELMA AND LOUISE . Oh , did you ? A couple of days ago , and really liked that . Actually I saw it twice because I liked it so much . Oh . See that 's also on my list . And it 's very , it 's really disturbing but a good movie . A disturbing movie , how do you mean ? Well , it was , um , let 's see . The , um , it 's , it 's different , it 's kind of , it 's an action adventure kind of , you know , shoot 'em up kind of film . Right . But it 's with women in it instead of men so that 's kind of a -- A switcheroo , huh ? -- that 's kind of a twist on the normal thing . And it made me think a lot about , you know , you would applaud Bruce Willis in DIE HARD if he was doing this 

but you might not be so -- Right . -- you know , so encouraging , of Susan Sarandon and then Gena Davis when they do it . When the shoe is on the other foot and see how it , So , that was kind of interesting . I 've , but I really enjoyed it . Oh . So , I w- , Because that , that just reminds me of , you know , like back in school and , you know , the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something . Yeah , that 's kind of what it was . Just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble but , Right . um , yeah . They had started out with that , then they got into lots of trouble . Before we found the shopping malls that 's what we did . Uh-huh . Yeah , well , I 'll have to put that , I 'll have to keep that on my list then . Yeah . I also saw that Madonna movie . Oh . It 's TRUTH OR DARE and that was pretty scandalous . Scandalous ? Yeah , it was kind of , yeah , Madonna -- I can imagine . -- she 's pretty trashy . And so it was , it was interesting . I guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is , huh ? Righ- , well , I think she kept saying that , uh , they talked about her , it , it was a film of her concert , um , tour she had taken through all , all around the world . And they were all MUMBLEx to her at the Vatican city and would n't let her perform in Rome , and she , Huh . kept saying that her show was not garbage . It had a social message to it and , You just had to find it . You had to wade through it and find it . Right . We never quite believed that , so . You never quite got to , I thought that was pushing it a little bit but , she MUMBLEx , All I know about that woman is that she 's an in , incredible marketeer . She is . She 's rich . Yeah , and she 's rich and she , yeah , so . MUMBLEx she 's smart at what she does . She knows how to do that . She knows how to twist this around , huh ? Yeah . What did you think about DANCES WITH WOLVES when you saw it ? Well , okay , see , we 're getting back to last year . That 's probably the last movie I saw . Um , DANCES WITH WOLVES , I just adored it . Really ? How can I tell you . Um , a couple years ago , I guess , well , maybe ten years ago I , I had read BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE and , Uh-huh . so , you know , just the general theme of the whole movie was , um , pretty , I mean I really liked it a lot . Right . I mean it was a real consciousness raiser , I guess . Um , and I only bring up WOUNDED KNEE because that was what ten years ago you read and , and understood , you know , about the American pop , Indian population , Right . and then everything went away for a couple years , Uh-huh . and now it 's back again . And , you know , it 's sort of a popular view of , um , what happened way back then . Right . Of course , no one will ever know . Really I do n't kn , I know , I was , I wondered if , uh , the tribes that they represented the tribe that was the , the evil tribe , if they were really as bad as it made them to be . Well , who knows . I mean it , it , it sort of showed like two different types of tribes like one was a warring tribe , and the other one was , uh , vegetarian kind of , you know , feel good tribe . Right . You know , sort of thing , so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world . Uh-huh . Nobody can get along peacefully . Yeah , but I wonder I thought the- , because they made a big deal about how this , this film was such a big leap for the , the people who , who were the ancestors of the , this Indian tribe and that , you know , that was so wonderful that they done that and they , uh , uh , I wonder how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film , Oh , I see . if it , you know , you did n't , Yeah . hear any press about that . Huh . I thought it was a very interesting movie . Well , I think so . I , um , I have come to respect a little bit more the , uh , you know , what went on here , Right . but , but who knows how it 's supposed to all end . Uh-huh . Right . You know on the , on the broad scope I mean , um , like if , uh , it , it , it had a much bigger thing I thin , meaning to me I think about , you know , just the meaning of , um , the freedom of this country and , and what that really meant . Right . And that was taking over somebody else 's freedoms . Uh-huh . And sort of trampling that and , uh , so you know it , it meant something bigger I think . But still it was a fantas- , I loved the buffalo scene . And I thought Kevin Costner was just , I got a little sick of his mug on the screen every , I know the , three minutes , but he 's the director , you know . Um , but , yeah , I , I just thought it was a really interesting , intense film . Well , that 's good . Intense I think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast . That was , that was , it was , it was good . I looked at my watch only a few times , Yeah . which is a good thing . Ate a lot of popcorn . But it put me in a really , it put me in a really bad mood , I do n't know why . Did it really ? Yeah , we di- , there were three of us who went . We were just all grou , really grouchy when it was over . Huh . So we decided that may be the mark of a good film . It made us think . And so , It made you think . we were grouchy . We felt guilty for being , Maybe i- , well , maybe that was , um , but there are no answers , you know . I know and we , we had , nothing to do with it . That , that can make you crabby , yes . We were not responsible , but we still felt the thick blame for , Really , that 's true . what had gone on . We could have , But it , it 's , they sort of candy coated the western story for many years , Right . and , um , you know , when the truth , oh , well , it always balances out one way or the other -- Uh-huh . -- once you get the whole story but , Yeah . Well , Righ- , I do . I 'm just out of school so I 've seen , Oh , okay . a lot of mo- , do n't have a job so I should n't go see movies all the time . Oh , there you go . Um , I rented a good movie , um , called CINEMA PARADESO -- Oh . -- which is an Italian movie -- Oh . -- which is probably the best movie I 've seen ever . It was just , Really ? wonderful . It 's , uh , story about a little boy in a Italian , a little Italian village , and he , um , owns a , um , or he works in a , a movie th- , theater and it w- , it helps the projectionist . There 's a little , oh , an old man who 's the projectionist and he befriends this old man , and then it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years . Oh . And it 's just , I mean , if you do n't mind reading subtitles , I thought I had to kind of get beyond that . Those little , you know , reading the little words at the bottom of the screen but , um , oh , I just laughed and cried and , Oh , I 'll have to write that down . I really loved it . That was a , a great one . Wow . And other than that I , I 'll have to write that , have you , have , did you see TEXASVILLE ? Are you into , No , I had , Larry McMurtry ? I had n't . I had read , um , THE LAST PICTURE SHOW and but that 's out on video now and I have n't seen it . But I was interested in reading TEXASVILLE before I saw the movie . Yeah . Did you like it ? Um , I , I read a lot of Larry McMurtry books -- Right . -- and TEXASVILLE is just like that . It 's like very peculiar circumstances -- Uh-huh . -- and very peculiar things that people do with each other it 's , it 's , you know , and it 's just sort of a ,
