And you say you have some strong feelings about , uh , the issue ? Uh , yes I do as far as , uh , as far as , uh , as far as immigration as a whole goes . Uh-huh . I think that , uh , we simply must start accepting everybody in the world . 

Uh-huh . Uh , I , there just is not going to be room for all of us . We do n't have jobs now . I , I think , uh , I think when we come to a time of recession that it 's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time . Uh , I hope you 're one of the employed right now . Uh-huh . I am one of the unemployed right now . I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company and , uh , I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings but they had two thousand applications . Yeah . And I know that there are a lot of foreigners , uh , here , you know , doing my line of work . Uh-huh . And , of course , I 'm not perfectly happy about not having a job . Right . So , how do you feel ? Well , I 'm a little bit ambivalent . The problem with , uh , and I think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it , uh , in , in terms of what , uh , really is driving it . They 're not willing to tell the truth . The same way with , uh , issues of , uh , race and things like that . I mean right now , uh , I believe there are two policies that , uh , that the government uses to modulate immigration . Three actually . One is at the high end , uh , they always want to be able to , uh , do some brain draining . They always like to be able to attract the , uh , Einsteins or the Professor Chou or , you know . Right . They 'd like to be able to get the top people in any field and so they can almost always find room for someone like that . At the bottom end , they , uh , are always willing to , uh , let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the , powerful people in that area . Those are two things that I think are going on . Although they , I , I do n't think the politicians would tell you that . Okay and I think you 're right in both cases . And then the , third thing is , uh , the political aspect of , uh , uh , letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico . They can not close off the Mexican border . Not because it 's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be , uh , uh , would spill over to this country so they keep allowing , uh , the pressure cooker to let off steam . And I think probably it 's pretty important right there . How do you feel about Haitian immigration ? Uh , that 's one of the few things I guess I found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan . I think they 're a very difficult group to integrate into , uh , society . They 're very difficult , uh , group to find jobs and , uh , and , uh , places for . And so , uh , uh , I do n't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that , uh , in that they 're pretty miserable where they are . But I 'm not to sympathetic about , uh , letting large numbers of Haitians in . Actually , actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here . Yeah . And it would have nothing to do with political situations . It would have to do with poverty . Right . But if you let them , yeah . If you let them in a million at a time , it would n't make that , you know , it would n't make that big a bulge in the population . But -- Oh , my gosh . -- po- , politically and economically . Have you been , have you been to southern Florida ? Yeah , well I know about it . Uh , I mean it 's , it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans , uh , twenty years ago . Well , I mean and the two of them together . I mean we can , it 's just as well you know , it 's hardly America anymore . On the other hand , you know , the ironic thing about this is that there 's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than our first generation immigrant . So there 's , uh , there 's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in . But there 's some differences in the immigrants , that , that we 're getting now . Well -- Right . -- I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration . Sure . I think , probably your , a great deal of what you say is true about the legals . Right . But , uh , the majority of the illegal immigration we 're getting now , they do not come here to blend into America . Uh , they , they do n't bother to learn our language and , uh , first of all , th- , they , I 'm sorry , this , I really feel strongly about this . Uh-huh . We send a lot of money to Mexico . Uh-huh .
