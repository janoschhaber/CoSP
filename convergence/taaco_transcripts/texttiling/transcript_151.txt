Hi , Wanet . How are you ? I 'm doing fine . Where you from ? I 'm from New England . Massachusetts . Okay . I 'm from Berkeley , California . Wow ! This is quite a , quite a long distance . Yeah , it certainly is . Do you have any pets ? No . Use too . Use to , but none , none right now . How come , uh , you do n't have any now ? 

You get tired of them ? Well , I , I live in an apartment building and , and , uh , and , and , it , it , it 's ju- , just not feasible -- Yeah . -- you know . I 'd love to have a dog , you know . I 've got a little doggy , uh , that I 've had quite , uh , quite a long time . 

In fact , she just turned sixteen years old New Year 's Eve . Ah . And , uh , Is she ? I beg your pardon ? What is she ? She 's , uh , uh , uh , a poodle . Uh , a toy poodle , a toy poodle and she 's , Ah . Ah , my , I got my mom a teacup little mutt ,  not too long ago . This is a little bigger than a teacup . Yeah . And , uh , it 's funny how , uh , how I , I , uh , a , acquired this animal . Uh , when I was , uh , married , my , uh , ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy . That she needed , uh , the woman needed someone to baby-sit and , uh , this is what she had told the kids and she even told me that . And after the two week period was up , uh , she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it . Well , after you had an animal for a couple of weeks , it 's , uh , you become -- Oh , for sure . -- you become attached to it . Oh , yeah . So , I 've had this dog now for , for sixteen years and she 's been a lot of company . Uh , she 's , uh , however , getting a little old and things are starting to fail . Uh , I , I live alone now and she stays in the house all day while I go to work and , uh , she 's been holding herself pretty well . The , uh , up until , you know , recently where she 's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is and , uh , I find a little present on the floor sometimes when I come home . But she 's , she 's usually pretty good . Yes , well . My , my mother has one that 's , uh , it 's , uh , it 's , uh , teacup and , uh , it 's made such a difference for her . But , you know , just , I , e- , e- , you know , the way my mom 's presence countenance is , just , just for having a puppy but , you know , having this dog she 's had it for , I guess three years now . Uh-huh . Oh , possibly four . But , uh , it was , it , it 's it 's really made such a difference for her . I really would like to , uh , I 'm a disabled person -- Uh-huh . -- so I 'm unable to , to , really take care of a pet and if that were n't so , I would certainly have one . I just , I just , it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog yeah . Huh . Well , you might want to get yourself , uh , an animal that does n't require much attention . Like a cat . Oh , yeah . Well , yeah , uh , I , I , I typically am not a cat person .  I have a friend that , uh , has on occasion , uh brought her cat over for me to keep for , you know , from time to time . And this cat is like no other cat I have ever seen . And , uh , it would sleep on my chest ,  you know . Yeah . It 's just , it 's just a great cat , but . Well , my , my personal preference is , is a dog . Uh , I do n't know that , uh , that I would ever want a cat . Oh , I like cats . I just would n't want to own one . Uh -- Well , you do n't own cats . -- they 're not , uh , they 're , they 're affectionate but they , yeah I do n't know , I ca n't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog . Yeah . You , they , they own you -- Yeah , right . -- or , or , you know ,  grant you with you their presence , you know . Yeah . Right . That , yes , we 're supposed to appreciate them . Well , my , my dog when I came home , uh , when I come home in the evenings , my dog greets me at the door . I do n't know that a cat would do that , uh . Yeah . I used to have ,  a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life . Yeah . I could just walk in the door and she knew whether to , to , to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over .  I mean she really could pick up on my mood -- Yeah , yeah . -- uh , the way I walked in the door . It was , uh , uncanny . Huh . I , I think , uh , in a way we 're able to read each other pretty well because , uh , she knows when I 'm upset and I know when she 's not feeling good too . So . Yeah . I know like when she has an accident , I know she 's not doing it on purpose . When -- Yeah . -- when she was younger , she used to do that to get even with me ,  Uh , and , and , you know , some people might not believe that but , but , but , uh , I do . Sure . Oh , absolutely . Like if I , if I put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours , uh , because I was going out . She would , uh , break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to , uh , to , to let me know that she was unhappy with what I did . Really ? Yeah . That 's the way , well , I had that cat that I mentioned , Alfie . One morning , you know , the first thing you do is you get up and you , you , you feed this cat some- , something and , and you make sure that it can get to its litter box . Well , -- Uh-huh . -- for some reason during the night , the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through and , uh , the next morning , uh , when my roommate got up and , and , uh , did not feed it right away , it decided that , that it was going to protest .  And so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket ,  for me . Looking , looking at me eye to eye ,  all the time while it was doing it . All right . Have I got your attention now ? Oh , yes . Animals have a way of talking . Alfie did . I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day . I , I do n't know that I 'd , uh , that I 'd trade my dog in for the world . Uh , it was about two years ago she got sick on me and I took her to the , uh , to the vet 's because she was n't eating and , and , uh , she was n't able to jump . She , you know , lost all her activity and , uh , she stayed there for one day and the doctor called me up and said , uh , she had a low white cell count and that , uh , she was n't , she was dying and , uh , suggested that I take her to a working hos- , dog hospital , animal hospital . So I took his suggestion and I , uh , took the , the dog to a hospital . The dog hospital there and they said they 'd keep her there for three days . Well , she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care . It cost me over five hundred dollars . Ouch . Plus , the , the , uh , the vet sent me a bill for what he did and , uh , then she recouped . She was okay for a couple of years . And then she got sick on me again and I brought her to a different vet this time and I told the vet what medication I had given her and everything . And , uh , he gave me the medication , the same medication that I gave her the last time and she was okay and she 's been okay every since . It 's been about two years now . Huh . Well , that 's great , it really is . I , I 'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time . Yeah . Well , the , see the problem is if , if the , if someone would have came up to me and said it 's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive . What do you want to do ? I probably would have had second thoughts . Yeah . Of course , you would . But what they , well , what they do is , is they say , well it 's going to cost , you know , twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this and , and , you know , and it creeps up on you . You do n't know that , uh , you know . You really , y- , you do n't know what it 's going to until it 's all over .  Uh , to give you an example . My mom had an elderly cat who , uh , whoever evidently got a hold of it and , uh , the cat got sick . So she took the cat to the vet and she had the cat there for two days and then the cat died . So the doctor had called her up and said , uh , your cat died and you owe me this bill , and oh , by the way , do you want me to , to bury the cat .  So , it cost her three hundred dollars , uh , and she did n't get the cat back . So , yeah , they had to pay for all the medical , uh , bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses .  And , uh , you know , she just brought the cat in because he was n't feeling good . So that -- Really . Geez . -- that was kind of a surprise At lea- , Yeah . You kind of wonder what really happened . Yeah . Well even the , you know , they , they claimed they did the best that they could have have and then the cat , uh , died . So -- My goodness . -- I 'm , I 'm looking for another cat for them . Uh ,  I , I 've , I 've got a little kitten , uh , that 's still , uh , just being born right now . So another five or six weeks I 'll be bringing the little kitten over to , uh , to my folks . Well , that , that , that , that will make their day . Yeah . I , I think it will because they 're both in their , in their seventies . And , uh , the cat , uh , although it 's a little bit of work for them sometimes , it turns , it turns out to be , uh , uh , a pleasant experience for them . Uh , I think they enjoy that . Only work initially . Yeah . For cats anyway , you know . Yeah . Well , listen it 's been a pleasure talking to you . Well , the same here . And you take care . Okay .  Bye now . Maybe we 'll talk again sometimes . Okay . What is that sound ? That 's my buzzer at the door . Oh , okay . I 'll let you go . Okay . Right . Thank you .
