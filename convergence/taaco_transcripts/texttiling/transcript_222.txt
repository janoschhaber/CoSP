Okay ? Sure , go ahead . What kind of books do you like to read ? Oh , I like all kinds of books . Yeah . Mostly , uh , something , I like like true life , Uh-huh . not , uh , you know , documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life . Uh-huh . And , uh , I also like romantic novels . 

I like , uh , I like READERS DIGEST , believe it or not . Yeah , so do I . I usually read that from cover to cover . Yeah . I like it because there 's a little bit of everything in it . Right . You know , that kind of a thing . Uh , as far as like real novels , I have n't gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing . Uh-huh . I wish I had in , in some senses but I do n't have time really as much as I would like to , to get into that kind of thing . 

How about you ? Um , well , I like , like you said , real life , um , I like biographies of people 's lives , Uh-huh . like , especially like athletes , 

for some reason it seems to interest me , like people that make a big comeback or , Sure . you know , Orel Hershiser , things like that . Uh-huh . And , um , I like to read books on improve , like family , marriage , you know , things that are written by like Christian authors or , um , doctors about family and , you know , how to improve your home and all that kind of thing . Um , I like to re , the magazines I to rel- , I like to read MUMBLEx , I read a lot of bicycling magazines . They 're , I mainly look at the pictures and stuff , 

but they usually have some good articles in it . Uh-huh . But , uh , I do n't know I have n't really found any romance type stuff I like to read . I , I 'm more true , you know , Yeah , yeah . fi- , uh , nonfiction . I have n't found a lot of , uh , fiction books that I really like 

but , uh , not to say I would n't , Yeah . eventually I mean . What was the last book you read ? Uh , jeez , let me think , it , I tell you I have n't read a book in a long time . And it , I ca n't even really remember . Uh , I think it was a romantic novel by Danielle Steel or one of those . Really ? You know , yeah , honestly . Um , I do n't do as much reading , like I say , as I would like to . Yeah . MUMBLEx working a lot of hours at work and , Really ? Yeah , 

and then , of course , I know . we have a home so it 's , you know , a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or , Yeah . you know , that type of thing . I , I set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is like about eleven more books than I would have read last year , but so far I 've only read like two books and so I 'm not doing very well 

but , But see I do crafts too , Yeah . so it 's hard , I , if I have a minute that 's what I , I do . Yeah , I find it 's real hard , 

I let papers , newspapers stack up and magazines stack up , if I do n't really set aside a time to look or read them . That 's the , and , and that 's like myself I 've , I 've , I miss it , because I really find it a very relaxing hobby too . Yeah . I really do and , um , I do n't know it seems like you can get lost in a book , you know , it , it , Uh-huh . it 's like an escape for me . I do n't know about you . Yeah . It 's , if I 'm really interested in what I 'm reading , I mean , hours can go by 

and I , I look up at the clock and say , oh , my word , you know . Uh-huh . In fact , I 'd rather read sometimes than watch T V . Yeah , oh , I would too . But I think you get out of the habit , like you say , you have to like kind of set yourself , 

Kind of train your mind . Yep . Have you ever read , uh , or heard of the book THIS PRESENT DARKNESS ? No . That was one of the books I read this year , and it 's really fast paced and intense . It was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book but it was ar- , it was one of the best I read , I mean , it was real good , and it was , um , it was one of the few books that like it , you know , just hurry up and go through without putting down , you know . Yeah , right . See that 's the other problem I have . 

If I start into something and I really enjoy what I 'm reading , Uh-huh . then I have a terrible time getting away from it too . I 'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning , you know , because I 'm so engrossed in it and then before you know it , it 's time to get up and go to work . 

You know , that type of thing . Yeah . That 's why I , I do n't know I 'm , I 'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that . Even if I 'm , uh , doing something like an afghan , if I 'm close to the end , sometimes I 'll , do the same thing . Uh-huh . I do n't know what you would call it , maybe I have a problem . No , I 'm sure it 's fast MUMBLEx or something . It 's terrible , I , I really like books that , that you can get into and that 's that . Uh-huh . I know what you mean . I like reading late at night right before I go to bed sometimes 

I just sleep better or something . Oh , yeah , you do you kind of get relaxed , that 's true . But , uh , I have a lot of craft books that I have too and , uh , magazines . I like PEOPLE , you know , those things that are about real people . Uh-huh . And , um , I , I like to , uh , read about people who have been a successful , Yeah . you know , who , who made a success of their lives . Which , what book have you read that is along those lines , that was really good ? To , to give you specific titles I , I ca n't . 

Well , how about who , Like I say , have n't done it in , in such a long time . Do you know who it was about ? Um , well , I went to , uh , seminar on , uh , it was for , by American business and some of the people , uh , what the heck was his name , I 'm trying to think . He 's one of the , uh , Paroe , and um , it was more like , oh , 

it was tapes and things that they had about him , too . Uh-huh . How he started out as just a salesman and now he 's , you know , multimillionaire and that type of thing , and how you have to , uh , be aggressive and , you know , really want something for yourself and that type of stuff . It 's like up to you , in other words , whatever happens in your life . Yeah . It 's not up , it 's not someone else , you have to do it . Yeah . 

And then do it . Do it . I ca n't , I 'm not that focused on something . I , I 'm off in all directions . Um , and I 'm not , uh , uh , a planner which I wish I was . Uh-huh . You know , kind of off the wall . If someone says , do you want to do this tonight , uh , and I got a mountain of things to do , it 's okay , you know , we do it . Uh-huh , huh . Well , that 's all right . I know , I know , but I wish I was more the other way . You 're more fun though , see . You 're not ridged right ? Yeah , right I , I , that 's see , I like it that way though . I , I , I would , I do n't want to change that part of me . That 's good . That 's funny , e- , even though I admire someone who is n't , Yeah . like I am , you know , and , and I wish I could be more that way but , There may be some schools you could read about and learn . That 's true , that 's true . How many people do you supervise ? Uh , about twenty . Oh , that 's not bad . No . That 's not bad at all . No . Do you like your job ? Sometimes . Sometimes more than others . But , yeah , I do . Oh , that 's , I 've been there about three years . oh , that 's important . Do you have a family ? Yeah , I just got married last year and , um , most of my family 's in Indiana . Oh , uh-huh . So , I 've only been in Texas three years . Do you like it ? Yeah , I do . I love the weather down here . I , I loved , I loved Abilene too . That 's what I liked , too , is the weather . Yeah , I know . Except for tornados . Boy they , they have storms here I 've , Yes they do . And it , it , Hail and thunder and , it 's so surprising how it just happens , you know . Yeah . Unpredictable . Were you here during the hailstorm two years ago ? Uh , no . Oh , I 've been up here about three . Uh , we were down there , uh , from eighty-six to , eighty-five to eighty-six , no , uh , ei- , well , part of eighty-four to eighty-six I should say . Yeah , boy I had thirty-three hundred dollars damage done on my car , a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail . Oh , wow . I think State Farm went bankrupt . Oh , jeez . Just about . But , uh , I know the whole situation is bad up here , we 're having a terrible time with the recession . Really ? Yeah , yeah . It 's not good at all . Huh . I know things are pretty booming down there . I heard they sold Johnson City though . Yeah , and Colorado Springs . And Colorado Springs ? Yeah , I talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day and he was telling me about it . Oh , wow . They just sold it . Amazing . Closed up and moved down to McKinney . Oh , well , that 's good . At least they kept the business part of it . Yeah . It 's scary though I 'm telling you . I know . I do n't know , and , well , you know , with the other part of this thing was , how do you feel that this influences family . How do I feel what ? That , that books influence , do you know how to use them in your life or to influence , Uh-huh . I , I feel like it 's important for young children to read too . Yeah . And what you read to them . When my children wer , were younger , of course , they were all married and grown and I have grandchildren now , they were , uh , I , I read to them a lot . That 's good . And , uh , I think they 've all developed kind of an interest in reading also . That 's re- , yeah . I 'm not saying they read all the right things but they do read . Uh , where a lot of people do n't have any interest in it at all , and I think it 's important , Oh , yeah . because , uh , even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens , I mean , they do n't learn anything . It 's because they ca n't read . Yeah , it 's really surprising how many people graduate from high school , Yeah . and that I work with and people , I mean , I get memos all the time across my desk and things are misspelled and , Oh , it 's be- , unbelievable , it 's really , is n't it ? It 's pretty sad . Yeah . A lot of people that work for me that ca n't even spell or read , you know . Exactly , and I think that that 's why reading is so important , Yeah . because , uh , I think even mentally when you can do some ,
