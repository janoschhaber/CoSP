Okay . How do you keep up with current events ? Um , well actually , usually , uh , in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work , uh , usually catch the news in the morning . Yeah , what what channel do you watch or what station ? Uh , N B C . That 's the one I watch . I usually keep up with T V . I do n't , I am a student 

so I really do n't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff -- Uh-huh . -- so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really is n't -- Yeah . -- too great sometimes . Yeah , I usually tend to just , you know , rely on , you know , T V , uh , again , you know , just through the grapevine just , just to know like , you know like what today 's stories are 

and I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I 'm interested in any particular one . Yeah . The radio does n't really have much news sometimes . The stations I listen to are just mainly music . Yeah , I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all . Yeah . Do you think that T V is , uh , pretty accurate . I mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized 

or , Well , what I really do n't like about T V , especially local news as compared to like national news is just , uh , it seems , it seems like everything is very spoon feed 

and you know it 's , it 's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom -- Yeah . -- or like the news , because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports , you know , is your kid 's bus driver smoking crack , on the way to school , you know ? Yeah , it 's they mainly go with like popular topics -- Uh-huh . -- just not like basic news . Yeah . Also , also I have the observation of , uh , with the press is that , like any any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press , you know , which only happened like ten times in my life -- Huh . -- you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had , had more than just a blurb about it . That the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story -- Yeah . -- it 's something wrong . Going , they 're , looks like they 're going more for ratings than for -- Uh-huh . -- you know actual news . I think , you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers -- Uh-huh . -- they typically have a better . I am from a small town too here in Texas -- Uh-huh . -- and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato and , Yeah , the farm report . Yeah , farm report and oil reports . That 's pretty pretty sad or who killed who . Uh-huh . Also I have found that newspapers probably are n't as bad as television MUMBLEx . Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down and , Yeah . Well , in , uh , in Dallas , I do n't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby 's and the story was , uh , Was that like he started shooting people , people in this cafeteria or something ? Yeah . And the news covered it -- Uh-huh . -- right , you know , hours after it happened and they were taping people who were crying who -- Uh-huh . -- had everything and then like three days later this , uh , local news station was using as as their promo -- Uh-huh . -- to promote themselves . I just thought that was really that 's kind of cold , Oh yeah , I have seen that happen lots of times . You know , uh , Channel X gives you the best coverage you know we were on the scene with our team players and , Yeah and it was just , they were showing like these dead people -- Uh-huh . -- and they were showing people crying -- Uh-huh . -- I mean just taking advantage of you know . Uh-huh . They are trying to get the , you know , most emotional response for , Yeah , it did n't seem like there was much coverage of the story , but just the play on people 's emotions . It 's just gotten so , I mean , somewhere there 's , it 's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if you know -- Yeah . -- and everything . Yeah , yeah . You know , I 've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know -- Yeah . -- uh , you know even the national news I just find it to be you know -- Yeah . -- very watered down , very , What did you think of the coverage of the war ? Uh , I fou , I found it very one sided . Did you ? Uh , you know , it , it just seemed to lack any sort of debate . Yeah . Uh , you know , not saying that we shou , that we actually should have been there or should n't have been there , but it just seemed like , you know . They kept just showing , you know , how great we were doing and it never really showed what actually -- Uh-huh . -- the damage that really happened that 's -- Uh-huh . -- a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the , you know , the guys who did n't get hurt coming home and all the big parties -- Uh-huh . -- and they kind of you know , if they were going to show that why did n't they show the guys who -- Uh-huh . -- you know got really hurt and everything . Yeah , and I really think that you know in the involvement that the press states , you know that the the military basically sets the press ,
