I do n't know , um , do you do a lot of camping ? Well , my husband and I have n't done a whole lot of camping , we , but we bought a van last year , Yeah . and we were hoping , uh , to do some camping in the van , um , we did go camping in Arkans- , not Arkansas , Oklahoma . Uh , last year in , we camped in a tent , and , uh , there were two other couples with us and there was , uh , state park . Oh , so MUMBLEx , And it was really nice . Yeah , um , up here some of the state parks are really nice and some of them are n't , some of them are pretty rough . Really ? Um , yeah , they , they just have like outhouses , they do n't have like a shower room or anything , yeah , but some of them are really nice 

they have showers and full bathrooms , Um . um , but I do n't know , I , I 've been camping a couple times but I 'm not a real avid camper , uh , a lot of people I know are , but , um , I do n't , I do n't MUMBLEx . I , I do n't like really camping in the rough . 

I like the , the , the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that . Yeah , MUMBLEx we went , we went once to a lean-to and it , um , I mean , there was n't any electricity on the camp site but it was all right , we only spent two nights there . I would n't want to spend more than two nights . I would n't want to go for like a week , but , um , Yeah , that would , that would be much . two nights is good . Um , especially there was a little store close by , 

so , it was pretty nice . Yeah , the campsite that we went to was an area that , it 's right on a big lake , and there 's a lot of boating out there , and we , we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit but it was still , uh , it was still , too , cold . Oh , really ? Oh . Yeah , it , it was pretty early in the year . Um , yeah , 

up here you got to wait until , Aug- , August , until the water warms up . Yeah . Well , it 's not that bad but it 's still pretty chilly . Um , I do n't know , I was , I have a tent and I fluff out in it , in the backyard and stuff , but this thing about camping that bothers me is you 've got to pack everything and another thing is the thing seems to get , it 's dirty you know , Yeah . so , you ca n't keep the dirt out of the tent . I do n't know we have a seven year old , it 's pretty funny , like stay out . Yeah , we , we have , we have a dog and that 's just about as bad as a kid . Yeah , 

boy , he does n't go in and out of the tent a hundred times . Uh-huh . And use it as a play , uh , they like to play in them . Yeah , I do n't know how you can really keep , uh , the inside of a tent clean . Yeah , I do n't know . 

Other than , you know , taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and , and sweeping it out everyday , it 's really hard to , to keep the sand and dirt out of it . Yeah , well , what we were doing , we were just going to say , we 're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night , so , you know , no going in and out , and , or what he wants to do , we had brought his friend along , was play in the tent . It was like , no , this is not working , , you ca n't do that , 

you get the tent all dirty . Did , Plus you get it all wet , we were at a beach site , too . Uh-huh . 

Um , did you have another , a big tent , like uh , um , like a , looks like a sitting area type , you know , like a two room type MUMBLEx ? No , but , you know , I was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they are really nice and , um , up here we have , uh , we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime . Yeah , yeah , we do n't really have a problem with that , um , in these areas , um , and even , even when in Oklahoma when we camped I really did n't notice a problem with bugs . And I noticed that , I know that I said , that 's , 

I 've , I 've lived back east before , um , they , They 're terrible , they 're really terrible . Uh , but , there 's this one campsite , that it , just some of them are known but there is one that 's out in this big lake and its , its , its , mosquitoes are terrible and then there 's this , there 's this other one that 's more up in the mountains but it surrounds a man-made reservoir and there 's no bugs , that 's the whole thing that everyone told me , oh , I 'm , I was going to go to , Lit- , Little River State Park , MUMBLEx that place is great , there 's no bugs . Huh . But , oh , okay , because , uh , we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas , we were really affected bad by it , but really got it , um , almost destroyed the ch- , the tourism in one town , because of the mosquitoes , they 're so , bad . Really ? Yeah , that was , it 's a really nice area , I 've been there before and it 's , I , I could n't imagine ge- , living just sixty miles north of them but they were plagued , they were plagued with them , with mosquitoes . And you can go out , outside in the daytime , all right , 

but the minute the sun went down , um , that 's when it 's usually , the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out . Huh . I mean , just the very second , it 's really strange . They , uh , they must , uh , work on that , you know , the , i- , it gets cooler when the sun sets 

and then they all come out . Well , have you ever , have you ever taken any of those , um , what do they call this , MUMBLEx lights , have you ever used those ? Oh , yeah , yeah , I never really noticed how effective they were , but , um , because that was n't really , I bought them , MUMBLEx I really did n't get to use them like , oh , there 's mosquitoes let 's turn them . 

We just sort of lit them . Uh-huh . And , um , we were n't bothered that much by mosquitoes , so , we did n't really contribute it to that . But , um , I think in an area that 's really thick with mosquitoes , I ca n't see all this little , uh , smoke buckets I call them , Yeah . MUMBLEx they work , but they 're suppose to work really well . Huh . Oh , I 'm in my paperwork here , that 's what I do when I wait for a phone call , I get in my paperwork . Oh , to find my most important parts . But I do n't know , I do n't know if I 'm going to go , I wish was an avid camper and I could really talk about like gardening or something , 

you can talk about that a lot , Uh-huh . but , um , I do want to go again . We just moved to a new hou- , into a house , so , I do n't think camping , maybe in the backyard , 

but I do n't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer . Yeah , I 'd , I 'd like to go camping cross-country , um , I just got married less than two years ago , so , we do n't have any , any children yet , um , So , it 's easy for you to go . Yeah , so , easy to pick up and go , and , s- , we have a van 

and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it . Um , oh , God . So , it 's not really , I guess , camping the way peop- , most people picture camping in the tent but , I do n't know but that sounds that my , my kind of camping , it really does . Yeah , okay , um , well , um , 

that is MUMBLEx is to have a , a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it , plus your tent . Yeah , or , or get , my brother has a real nice pop-up . Yep . And he just , he just tows it behind his truck . Um , And he , he 's got three kids , so , his kids will sleep in the truck , in the , in the back of the bed . Um , and they sleep in the pop-up . Well , those , they 're kind of nice but they 're also , um , flimsy when you really look at them . 

But when you get inside they 're really nice , you know , Yeah . everything 's really , but then when you look underneath them , it 's just got these little wheels and this MUMBLEx little axle , it 's like , oh , my and then a big windstorm it would pick you up . Yeah , he did have a problem , uh , when he went camping last year in Beavers Bend , Ok- , Oklahoma , um , a , a storm came in and it started raining really heavy and they were all , everybody was trying to flee the campsite , , everybody was getting stuck in the mud . Oh , jeez , And , uh , yeah , what do you , what do you do when you get a , I mean , like a really violent storm like a tornado , just stay in your truck . I mean , I would n't stay in the , um , Well , theirs was so bad , and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up , Oh . and they had to get out of there . So , then , were they successful ? Yeah , they , yeah , they were . But it took them a little while ? But , yeah , they they decided that , that was enough camping for the weekend . Yeah , so , did they get stuck ? No , they ended up getting out . They ended up helping several other people though that were , that were stuck . Yeah , huh . Well , so , they evacuated it . Yeah , yeah , they , the whole , the whole campsite was evacuated . Wow . I mean some , I think some people that had fairly sturdy , um , vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water , I think they stayed . Yeah . But everybody that was real close to the water ended up , it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream . I know I always I like MUMBLEx to get right on the water , yeah , by the campsite , it 's so , Yeah . MUMBLEx we have lean-tos up here . I really like them , like I say , they 're kind of , just kind of more sturdy than anything , you know , just , just , They have them right at the campsites ? Yeah , they 're , they 're lean-tos . Wow . Yeah , they 're pretty nice , they 're , they 're , uh , it 's like a little house except the whole face is open , and the one time that we went , we got one , it was overlooking the water but it was a big embankment , I wanted to get one right on the water . MUMBLEx we had an electrical storm too , and it was really , it was neat sitting there watching it , I mean , it was raining , 

when we called MUMBLEx home , everybody said , oh , we were worried about you in that storm ...
