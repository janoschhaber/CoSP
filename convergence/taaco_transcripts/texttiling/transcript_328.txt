Well this is a subject that you never think you 'll be assigned to . No . One that kind of comes up when you 've lost it , the others , other subjects . Um , as I was sitting there , I thought , the weather 's been perfect . I do n't know much to say about it . It 's , uh , it 's , you know , 

for the balloon festival here in Plano it was just gorgeous . I 'm from Plano also . Are you ? It could n't have been better . That 's right . I mean , it did n't foul one launch , and that 's kind of unusual , and it 's kind of cold in the mornings so you dress up warm , but by , Right . That 's the only thing wrong I can find with it . I just got back from Dayton . 

I spent the weekend in Ohio with my family -- Oh , how fun . -- and the trees are changing color there . I miss that , yeah . So , that , as soon as we got out of the cloud cover . Of course it was n't sunny like it is here . It was real gray -- Yeah . -- but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and I saw all those trees , it just really made me realize how much I miss the fall . Yeah . 

I do n't complain weather wise though , because it was also thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning , and the high was only fifty , and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon -- Ooh . -- so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies . I guess you have to take some things and leave some things . That 's right . Yeah , I 'm from Utah area , and they , you know , they have tons of canyons where the leaves change and they 're gorgeous -- Yeah . -- you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area . We did that when we lived up in Michigan . We went up to the upper peninsula , and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure . And then on leaf weekends it was , which is this time of the year , it 's bumper to bumper traffic , people as whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves , because they had to keep watching the road . Yeah , it 's kind of hazardous for driving -- Yes . -- that 's for sure . But I ca n't complain . I do n't know if I 've been spoiled . I 've been thinking it 's getting cold sooner than normal . We 've only lived here a couple of years . I think it is , and my family said that in Ohio there was just an article on , at the T V news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule -- Huh . -- as far as the coldness of the temperatures and , uh , the first frost , everything just happened three weeks early this year . We 'll have to see how it goes , a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal , but then we 're back to being warmer than normal this week , or last week , so . Just so we do n't have one of those famous ice storms -- -- in the spring . I do n't have to live through many , any of those really , a bad , I mean , nothing comparable , I guess , to what you 've had before . Well , I 've only been here just a short time , too , so I have n't been through -- -- any of those either , so . I have in Michigan , but in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow and life goes on . You 're right . So , as I understand it here , if there 's anything , they 'll call off schools and , and close businesses . Well , they get ice , and no one can drive on ice . Right . I mean , we used to think they were pansies , but then when you decided what ice was . Right , the real definition of ice . So , well , I think we 've discussed it good enough today . I think so . It was , It was nice talking with you . It was good talking to you . Maybe we 'll get the next time . Okay . Take care . Okay . Bye-bye . Bye .
