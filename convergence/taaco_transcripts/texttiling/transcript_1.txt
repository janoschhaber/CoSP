Um , you know , I wear suits , I wear skirts and sweaters . On occasion I can wear jeans . Um , how about you ? Well , I , um , run a business out of my home . Uh-huh . So I tend to get up in the morning , put on , Yes . sweats , um , Uh-huh . 

do whatever I want to do with the kids , then whenever I have a meeting with a client , I 'll put a suit on . Uh-huh . And then come home and get back into regular clothes again . Uh-huh . Um , you know , there 's real no , no real dress code where I work . Um , you see people wearing , you know , all different attire . I , um , do n't like to wear heels , that really tires me out . I work in a big building . Yeah . So , I predominantly wear flat shoes . Um , you know , in the winter I wear sweaters , in summer I , you know , I like one piece dresses , short sleeves , things like that . 

I 've recently , um , tried to update my wardrobe , trying to put suits together that I can interchange , the , Right . jackets and the blouses and all that a lot . Right . That 's helped me a lot with having , I can only have a , a limited wardrobe , since I 'm only , Uh-huh . working part-time right now . Uh-huh . Um , but still , it gives it some variety . Uh-huh . Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that . Right , right , accessories , 

uh-huh . What about your casual wear ? Do you like to wear jeans most of the time ? Um , yeah mostly . I mean , at home I predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that , Yeah . also . It 's nice you can wear shorts , especially on a day like today when it 's so hot . Yeah , well , they 're , um , you know , they 're like Ber- , Dress shorts . yeah , they 're like black corduroy Ber- , Bermuda shorts . Yeah . And sometimes I wear a blazer with them , and I get really a lot of compliments on them . 

Um , where I work is predominantly male . Yeah . So , you know , they , their attire is always the same , you know . Suits or slacks , you know , jeans , whatever . Yeah , but , And , um , but I 'm really the only woman , I guess , at work that does that , but seems to work for me . Yeah , but . In fact , I just bought , I , I just got a new outfit as a gift that , um , it 's one of those skorts , you know , th- , it 's shorts but it looks like a skirt . Uh-huh . So , I think that 'll be good for work , too . Oh , yeah . It 'll be comfortable . Yeah . Yeah .
