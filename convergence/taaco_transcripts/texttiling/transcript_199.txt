Okay , the topic was , should the United States adopt the metric system , and if so , should , uh . How should they do it ? Why did n't it work last time ? And why did n't it work last time ? . Well , I 'm all for it . Yeah , well , I , I am too . 

I wish , uh , it had started a long time ago , is the problem , because we 're so wound up in the -- Yeah . -- in the system that we 've got that , you know , trying to convert over , and I guess , what 'd they try , they tried what 'd the call it , soft conversion and hard conversion -- Yeah , they tried the , -- one of them is where you just take whatever 's already standard and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter . Yeah , yeah , direct conversion . I , I do n't know . Uh . I think they just ought to , you know , start , uh , just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever , you know , start your packaging , go to liters instead of quarts , 

and you know , people if they have to are going to learn to think that way . Well do n't most of them , does n't just about everything now have both metric and English . They do , but things are generally packaged in the English sized packages , you know . You buy a quart of milk , and sure it has , has the metric equivalent written on there , but it still a quart . Oh , yeah , yeah . But if they started putting it in liters , liter of oil , and you know , liters of gasoline , people are going to learn to think in metric . As long as you can still buy a product in the English units , that 's how you 're going to think of it . I kind of remember back when gas prices started up , you know , pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range , somebody had , uh , 

I believe it was Exxon -- It figures . -- we were living in Lubbock at the time , they started marketing it in liters , and it was only like twenty-nine and thirty cents a liter . So they could put this sign out front that said , you know , thirty-nine cents a liter . Right . And nobody had any idea what a liter was , so , uh . That , that 's the problem . When we finally out that liters was about a quart , there 's about four liters in a gallon 

so you can figure out what you 're actually paying for it . Right . It 's kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age , I do n't know , when I was growing up , we were talking metric system in school . Uh-huh . I mean , not , not at first , but by the time I was in fifth or sixth grade anyway . Yeah . Oh . I would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age , you know , under the age of thirty or so , to have some idea what it is , anyway . 

A liter 's about a quart . The , uh , I think maybe there 's where the problem came in , you know . We 've tried to , instead of learning , it 's kind of like learning a language , you know , when you learn one from the other , you always end up in this conversion thing all the time . Yeah . So , you , it 's almost like , uh , course this country is n't a dictatorship , 

but , you know , it 's like somebody said , okay as of such and such a date , you know , anybody caught talking in the English , you know , will be shot or something like that , you know . But , uh , Well , thing is , it 's a global , global market place these days , and , you know , we 're like , what , one of two backwards countries in the world , as far as , Yeah , I read that , what Uganda and , Something . I do n't remember what the other one is but , There 's one or two others that just , It 's just time I think for , for us to go over . Because all you end up doing is if you 're in business or you 're in any kind of international , Uh-huh . I do n't , you know , I work for T I , we 're all around the world , you have to -- Yeah , uh , I , -- perform this conversion anyway . Yeah , I do , too . And . And one of the things that we 've run into a problem , course you 're familiar with the T I drawing , well , with any drawing system -- Right . Mils and microns . -- you end up with , you end up with things in inches -- Right . -- in parts of inches , you know , half , fourth , you know , this sort of thing . Right . And then you end up with a decimal , where you start getting into mils , and that sort of thing . Right . And then some of them are done in , you know , purely metric . Yeah , I remember that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns and ours were in mils . Uh-huh . And it got to , you know , somewhere down the line they went standardized , they went microns , but , uh , you just , you know , you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs . Yeah . Oh , I can imagine . So . The , uh , the one that , uh , uh , have you ever lived in a country where they use metric . No . I was with T I in El Salvador for a while , and I had to get used to , you know , purely metric system down there , because they did n't understand anything else . You know , if you start talking about miles , they 'd look at you like , what . Yeah . So , I had a little bit of experience with it , and also I noticed in Canada they , uh , you drop a quarter , fifty cents , whatever , in a coke machine up there , and you get this funny looking coke , you know , it 's in a can that 's that 's taller but not as big around . Yeah . You know , I guess that 's some -- About half a liter . -- it 's not a liter , it 's like a half a liter or something like that . It 's a strange looking can . But my daughter in law 's from Panama , and she has , they have had Americans down there for so long , you know , that they 're kind of into both systems , but , uh , she gets real confused on distances and temperature is the big thing -- Yeah . -- the Centigrade -- I would have more problem -- -- for which she says Celsius . -- more problem with the temperature , except that , you know , working in engineering , we do everything in Centigrade , or Celsius . Well , I had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature , you know , if it 's between zero and ten , it 's cold , and if it 's ten and twenty it 's not too bad , if it 's between twenty and thirty it 's pretty warm , It 's getting warm , right . if it 's more than thirty it 's just hotter than all get out . So , but , uh . The big problem is not having the , uh , the resolution between temperature , you know , between a hundred , if you 're talking about a hundred degrees or what , thirty , zero , you know thirty four degrees , whatever that is . You know , you do n't get all the little differences -- Yeah , it 's about . -- you know , the differences between seventy and seventy-two or seventy-five degrees is n't much , but the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is , quite a bit . Is about twice as much , what it works out to . Yeah , five . One point eight times as many -- Yeah , something like that . -- points . Yeah , so . I , I think as long as people have a choice , they 're going to stick with the American way . Uh-huh . And until we have to , have to learn to think that way , we wo n't . Yeah . Though we call it the English system , but I 'm not sure what they do in England now . They 're , they 're on metric , are n't they ? Yeah , for the most part , I think so . Yeah , except they 've got a , now , okay , we run into some problems once , I remember , they 've got a nut and bolts system called Wentworth . And this thing was , was even different than , you know , S A E standards and stuff . So , Right . This , this , ca- , okay , my dad bought one of these little Nash Metropolitans here a few years ba- , quite a few years back , and the thing had a Austin Heeley type engine , you know , it was Austin motors engine and running gear . Right . And the body was built by Nash , or who , you know , Ameri- , that was even before American Motors , but Nash , essentially , in the U S somewhere . And that thing had the darndest combination of metric and Wentworth and , uh , S A E . He ended up with about three sets of tools -- He just get one more MUMBLEx . -- in order to work on that fool thing . Because I think the Wentworth and the S A E bolt sizes were the same , but the threads were different , and , uh -- Oh , that would be a mess . -- it was a total mess . And on my Chevy van that 's a couple of years old . Part of it 's built in Canada . Matter of fact , the thing is , I always say it 's built off shore , you know , because it was assembled in Canada . The only thing that was in it was built in the U S was the , uh , differential , and it was built in Buffalo , New York . But it 's got the hardest combination of , uh , metric and , most of the body parts seem to be metric , and most of the engine parts seem to be S A E , so . It 's just crazy . Right . It just gets bad , now , you got to , you got to have one , and not mix them up . Yeah . Because you 're never going to get to one , one system if you still got a , got a mix . And of course , here that , that would involve changing road signs all across the country , you know , miles per hour to kilometers per hour , and the whole nine yards . Kind of hard to do gradually . I thought maybe they would convert to , uh , metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit , because what is it -- Yeah . -- fifty-six or fifty-seven 's a hundred , uh , qua- , a hundred kilometers , and you know -- Hell , you 'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour . -- yeah , you 'd have , hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five , you 'd have people going , you 're right , a hundred miles an hour . Yeah . And , so . I do n't know , I 'd kind of , and the other thing , too , is , you know , between here and El Paso 's , what , five hundred miles , but it 's almost eight hundred kilometers , you know . That 'd sure seems like a long way . Yeah , but they 'd need , they 'd seem to be ticking off faster , too . Yeah , I guess that 's it . Every road sign you come to , is like , well I do n't know it that far . Well they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour , you know , they could 've converted it to metric just about as easy . Yeah , I think they , you got the problem with all your cars are still , yeah , you still got cars on the road that do n't have both . Yeah . At that time , anyway , that was still when things were , the metric system was still not , Not all that common . You know , now cars , they have both . Sooner or later they 'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way . I know the only other place that I was ever at where they really had it mixed was , was in Panama , where 's a lot of the road signs and everything are in , in miles per hour and some are in kilometers . And you got to know where you are -- Yeah . -- because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour ,
