Okay . Okay . Universal health insurance , right ? That 's right . What would we like to say . I think , Uh-huh . I think that 's what the subject is about . 

Did you read , uh , the article in the paper today about this particular subject ? In the Dallas , the MORNING TIMES ? Yeah . I guess I did not . Uh , the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is , uh , going to begin testing a program , a state funded program for citizens of those two states and there 's fourteen other , uh , states that are considering it . Least according to the article in the paper this morning . I think it 's a trend that 's , that 's , that 's , uh , probably may go nationwide eventually because I think national health is something that we all need . It 's getting to a point that you have to have it , 

you have to have some form of health insurance . Well , it 's been interesting that we , Extremely expensive , though . Yes . So we live in a society , though , where everyone if you ask them on polls , will , uh , say that they think that everyone has a right to health care . Uh-huh . And yet , I do n't think we 've ever quite decided who 's really supposed to pay for it . Well , that 's the thing , you know , 

uh , unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are , are paying for the people that do n't have health insurance . Which is why people are talking about , we ought to just admit it perhaps -- Yeah . -- and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that 's more fair . I do n't think you , uh , You have health insurance ? Yes , I do . Through your company ? Uh , through my company , yes . But I have been in a situation , uh , recently where I was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year and my wife developed cancer . 

We did n't have any -- Oh , my goodness . -- insurance . And it was a -- That 's must have been hard . -- go to Parkland type situation . How was your care at Parkland ? Uh , because it was a life threatening situation , it was very good . 

Uh , as it , as it turned out one of the top , uh , people , or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at Parkland . But , yet , Parkland is not free , either . No , it 's not free , but , uh , Is it affordable ? It 's , it 's a situation that because I did n't have any insurance and I was on unemployment , it was paid by the county . So you did have a good experience . I had a bad experience as it turned out . 

Uh , I was fortunate that there was Parkland . Is your wife better , I hope ? Uh , no she passed away . I 'm real sorry . That 's all right . Sure . That happens . It does happen , but it 's very sad . Yeah , but in any event , uh , I 'm in favor of national health . Well -- If I had -- -- so am I . -- to vote for it . Actually , uh , I 'm a pediatrician -- Oh , is that right ? 

-- and I feel very strongly about , uh , children , and , uh , developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic -- Uh-huh . -- last year . Uh-huh . Where we certainly proved that we 're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most . So , uh , I 'm really quite active in trying to , uh , be proactive at least for children 's issues . It 's very complex , very complicated , 

but , uh , I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization , glasses , hearing aids , basic health benefits . Well , I , when I grew up and I grew up in south central Kansas , uh , we had , and my mom worked for the health department , the county health department and we had x-rays every year , we had a dentist come to our school and , uh , check our teeth once a year at least . Uh , we had all our flu shots taken care of , our measles , mumps , rubella and all that other stuff . Um . And , uh , when my children were growing up , we did n't have that . We had to pay for it , which I was n't opposed to paying for it . I had the money to pay for it , but I 'm sure that there were people that do n't . Well , and the costs have , so much has gone up so much . The cost of immunizations for example , uh , and just the legal , the legal benefits , uh , that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily , et cetera . Uh-huh . So , well , I do n't know , it 's , it is interesting , in case you did n't know , Texas leads the nation in uninsured children . Thirty-one percent of all Texas children -- Did not know that . -- do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid . So , uh , one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care . And I work in the children 's Parkland system and it 's pretty overwhelming to me . Uh-huh . 

But , uh , it 's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county .
