Hi . Okay . So , uh , with the issue of trial by jury , uh , I actually found the whole question about whether you need a , a unan , a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting . Yeah , actually , I , I agree that that 's an interesting thing . I , I believe that 's a , for , for civil suits it 's not unanimous , right , 

but for , for criminal suits it 's unanimous by federal law ? I do n't know if it 's even true that it 's always unanimous because I thought there were cases where , uh , I do n't know if it 's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors , but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve . Yeah , I actually thought I 'd read that , too and that 's why I phrased it that way . Yeah . I wonder , the difference , yeah , the difference could be that for , uh , state , if there is such a thing , state felonies versus federal felonies that federal , things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote , and things that are under state jurisdiction , even criminal do n't require , but I do n't know what the , the laws , do you think that that 's an unreasonable , uh , requirement that they be unanimous ? Well , I 'd be curious as to what the , uh , requirement for a , an acquittal is . And I , I do n't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if , you know , six or seven voted not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal . But I do n't know whether you need an , a unanimous , uh , vote of not guilty to acquit . Yeah , that , that would be an interesting change . It was also allow the , uh , idea that if you had one person who was , uh , very disagreeable that , I mean , it , it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because , uh , the fact that it 's w- , the , the principle is that the fact that it 's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt , uh , criterion that it , uh , increases the , the likelihood of getting the proper judgment . So , I , I think , if anything , it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision . Yeah , I 'd agree with that . But I 've never had the , the opportunity to serve on a jury , although I 've been out here and registered for , I guess , about five years . Yeah , actually -- But , -- I , I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do . I would like to do that . I 've been out here twenty some years and I 've been called , uh , three different times , but I 've never actually even made it into the , the jury box . Oh . And , because there have always been a number of people and , and I 've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions . Uh , I , yeah , I also think that would be really good . I , Well , the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that , you know , after initially finding out where people stand , that the whole deliberation usually results , if there is a , you know , something like a nine , three or , or more severe and , and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they 're right -- Uh-huh . -- and in fact , I 'm not sure that that 's any more , uh , liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than , than anything else . Well , the , the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I 've talked to on this , is that in the situation you just said where it 's nine to three , or some such number , that there 's , an effect starts being that there 's starts being a lot of peer pressure -- Uh-huh . -- going on and that that , uh , peer pressure , and in some cases if it 's a long trial , the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time , that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons . Yeah , I 'd -- Uh , -- read one book , I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things , that , uh -- Uh-huh . -- went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases , and in many cases looking at what had , at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right , went back to the jurors , uh , based on the deliberations . Some of them did say that , you know , when they were the only one left opposing the verdict , uh , you know , everyone was getting on them so , so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote does n't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict . Yeah , I , I understand . You , you would hope that if you were in that situation that you 'd have the moral fortitude , uh , to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response . I think of the movie , uh , TWELVE ANGRY MEN . Uh-huh . You ever seen that movie ? Yeah , once . Uh , , yeah , it 's , it 's , it 's exactly that situation where , uh , it 's Henry Fonda and it 's eleven to one and he 's the one , I , I believe he was opposed to the conviction and , uh , and he held on and ,
