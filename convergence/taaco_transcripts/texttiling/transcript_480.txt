Okay . You probably , uh , more up on this subject than I am , but , the roles that -- That , -- women have played in the last pup- , couple of year in our , or couple of generations . Right . Well , they 've entered the work force more , uh , you know , since World War Two is when they started . You bet . 

And , uh , I think that that is , you know , very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women . You bet . You know , where I 've noticed it more , I think , is , I 'm a traveling salesperson and I have traveled most of my life and I know just especially in the last , oh , ten years and really since , 

in the last half of dozen years I see more and more women traveling . Right . You know , as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers . I sell sporting goods and even in our industry , uh , there was virtually , really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things I sell and even in the last five or six years , boy we see more and more women being involved 

and , you know , it 's a , it 's a credit to them as far as how they 're doing things . Yeah , the , you see more of that , you see more of them , uh , leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel , too . You bet . You know , I , I go to a , I have a club that I belong to on Tuesday that , you know , one of the girls travels quite extensively and she says , well , my children have two parents . 

You know , why not . You bet . That 's sort of neat . So that , that 's a , I think that 's a change and I think that 's a change you 're going to be seeing more of in the , in the future , people having that kind of attitude that the father 's going to take more active role in child rearing . Sure . I think , uh , it 's the age old thing , every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you 'll see it on T V or something where the discussion comes out that , you know , women are paid less than men 

and they 're , and they 're doing the same , uh , or carrying the same job responsibility -- Right . -- and , you know , I , that 's a very true statement and it should n't , uh , it should n't be that way . No . You know . 

That , that I think should change , will change in the near future also . I think so , hope so , a- , It 's been changing , it 's been evolving , but there 's still a , an , an inequality in the -- Absolutely . -- work forces or jobs . It 's , you know , You know , I 've , And you hear some people say , you know , well , he 's a man , he , he , he needs that salary . Right . Yeah , they forget . Also , I think , uh , a good argument for that is in the area of politics , you know , if a , a woman Congressman I 'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as , and the same as a senator or whatever . Right . So , they certainly , uh , they certainly deserve it all the way . But , I guess just the most significant thing changed for me , again , as I mentioned , was just in traveling , you see , uh , more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and , uh , and in their business suits and -- And going , yeah . -- and going . Uh-huh . And I expect you 're right in regards to having two parents now . That 's a good , a good statement . And I think if , in the future it 's even going to be , uh , more noticeable and more significant . Right . Yeah , I , I think it will be . I think , I , well , an- , another thing I read , too , the other day , this is not just for working women but how much they 're out there , I guess is the car designers , uh , are starting to design cars with women in mind . Uh , because in the past the male bought the cars , but now they 're showing that fifty-five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases . Wow . And that they are looking for , uh , different things in the car . The man is looking for the e- , in the engine and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel . You bet . Uh , can her makeup come off the upholstery . Good point . And if they 're out there buying that many cars , then there 's that many out that are self sufficient and , you know , mobile and working . Right now I 'm self employed and , and my wife 's always worked . She 's a schoolteacher , but for , she started working and then when I first started my business , uh , she was selling real estate at the time and hers was the only income we had for three or four months so , Right . You know , she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my business and she still works everyday so , Yeah , we all do . You bet . I just happen to be off today . Uh-oh . I work , too . Enj , enjoying it . What kind of work do you do ? I 'm a nurse . Well , good . And I work at Medical Treatment Center , uh , which is at Garl- , uh , Jupiter and Arapaho . Right . Married ? No . Yeah . Well , trying to think what else I can say in regards to this subject . I do n't know , I 'm kind of out of , out of things . You see the old , uh , cigarette ads , you know , about you 've come a long way . You 've come a long way baby ? Baby , right , and , uh , Right . You think about this when you come to , when it comes to a subject like that and it 's really true . Women have come a long way and , you know ,
