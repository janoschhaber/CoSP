All right , have you lived in this area long ? No , I 've only been here a couple of years . Okay . Uh , but , uh , I 've , I 've noticed that , uh , this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past . Yeah , it , it , it 's , it 's a lot warmer , a lot drier too , because usually about this time of year , this , you know , you see a little bit more rain . 

I mean by , by mid February , I mean , we start getting a lot of rain . Yeah , yeah , well I remember last year , or the year before , But it , uh , we had ice and snow , uh , uh , terrible ice storm , uh , around this time of the year . Uh-huh . And , uh , this year it 's been so hot and , uh , sunny 

it , it 's really quite , uh , quite amazing . Yeah , unseasonable . I used to , my wife and I we used to live in San Antonio , couple years ago , Uh-huh . and it was , it was I remember the first day of Spring , it was so much ice that came down , later on that afte- , that afternoon and evening , Um . it was just , it was horrible . Yes , I was just talking to my son today , he 's up in Boston , and it was twenty-nine there and it was , you know , in the seventies out here and , Yeah . it was really , uh , he really wished he could be here , rather than there . Yeah , well , um , I do n't know I , I guess I 'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather . Oh really . Um , I , I like it warmer , I mean I like it , you know , I like it warm but it does n't really matter . I mean , I 'd , I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly but , uh , Uh-huh , uh-huh . I have , you know , I , I , don- , I think it 's really been delightful . I come , uh , I 've spent most of my time in , in warm weather areas and , uh , uh , the ice and snow just does n't , uh , hold any allure for me at all . Well I spent three years in Germany , so I 'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway . But I got used to it , it was really strange , I mean , when I , when , when , when we came to San Antonio it was just like , uh , you know , it just , just swelter and then we got used to it and then we went up to Dallas and it was just , it 's , it 's not , not that it 's just hot or dry , it 's just not very comfortable , it just , Her- , do you , you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas . Yeah , a little bit . Uh-huh . Yeah . You must , well , uh , it must be quite a bit hotter down there , is n't it ? Yeah , my wife and I , the last day we were in Florida , we , my visiting my , uh , my parents , and my brother and sister , we were , we were down there and , the last day , right before we left , we had to , I had to ride with my sister and the air conditioning went out on the car , Oh , wow . and , we , you , you just get used to air conditioning all the time , Oh yes . and this , it was just , the humidity was like eighty plus , eighty percent plus and it was just killing us . Oh yeah , it 's terrible . Orlando is the only place I 've ever been where I 've seen the car sweat . Yeah . I mean , that 's really bad . Yeah , well , I mean , I , I , I guess I 've been in some places , you know , where the weather was just so mild , you know , places like Monterey , California or , Uh-huh , uh-huh . you know , just , you know , so mild , and then you 've been to such extremes like San Angelo , Texas where you just , where you walk outside and you sweat , you know you 're sweating , Yeah . you look down at your arm , but you see the water leaving your arm , it 's so hot , Oh wow , uh . you just feel it pulling away , bizarre . I know I , I tend to , I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it 's very temperate . Yeah . Uh it does n't , some people say , uh , they , they like to watch the changing of the seasons but , uh , I 'd rather , you know , like southern California , you know , have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time . Yeah . So , it 's kind of a luxury . I tend to agree but , I do n't know , I , I think , in , in some , in some respects it probably MUMBLEx more tolerable . Yeah , well I guess this , the weather is n't as lively a topic as , uh , as some of the others we might have gotten . No , the other topics . I got one topic , they said talk about the Middle East situ- , well , I guess we 're supposed to say good-bye or something , and think about what my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye . We messed up the conversation , anyway . Well I mean I 've had some pretty bad , I guess some pretty controversial topics so it 's just like well that was my fault . But then the weather 's like , man , I mean , it gets pretty mundane , I mean you can only talk about , about the situation just so long . Yeah , I know , weather 's just not all that inspiring . Okay , well it 's nice talking to you . Okay . Bye-bye . Bye .
