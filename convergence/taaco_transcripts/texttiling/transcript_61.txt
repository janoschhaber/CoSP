Well , since you live close , I do n't know if you know , um , about what Louisville is doing with recycling , or are you familiar with any of that ? Well , I know that we have some relatives that live around , like the MUMBLEx area in there , Huh-uh . I know they 're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there . Yeah . You know , I read , you know , when they first started doing that in the paper , and I read about that , I was just praying that , that would be in our area , because we 've been recycling for quite some time . 

And , you know , we separate everything out , and then have to haul it up to a Metco , Huh-uh . you know , which is a real pain . So if they would come up , they 'll help you , curbside recycling , recycle , because we , there is some bins , like behind Wal-Mart , that take some things . Well , now have they moved them behind Wal-Mart ? Yeah . Oh , God . Because I finally asked because , you know , we had all of those milk cartons and there was nowhere else to take them and they had it in front of Wal-Mart and I ask in Wal-Mart 

and they said they moved it just behind . Oh . That 's really nice to know , because we were doing the same thing . Because to take it to a Metco , you have to take it when they 're open , you know , Huh-uh . which is always a real pain . And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot , we thought , oh , this is great . And we started taking them up there . And then , all the sudden , it disappeared , you know . I did n't know . 

And we 're going , oh , no , there goes our recycling place . Yeah . That 's really nice to find out that it 's behind there . Well , we pretty much do , um , plastic milk cartons and , um , um , um , newspapers . I could n't even think of what you call them . Yeah . 

Plastic milk cartons , newspapers and cans , and glass , I guess , is the four , is really the four things that we do . Like aluminum cans ? Yeah . Yeah . That 's about what we do too . And really , that 's about , that 's really about it . Is there anything , any place else that really takes anything other than that , that you know of ? 

Well , I guess , um , down in , kind of in North Dallas , there is a place that will take almost anything . Oh , really . Uh , I do n't , we just do n't have the room to store all that much , you know , I know . I do n't want to be running down there every week , I know . I know . or whatever . We 're kind of the same way . You know , at first , you know , you , at first it was a real , it was a real hassle , and I 'm wondering are we really going to do this , 

but you kind of get , I guess , into a little routine , you know , where it becomes , is automatic , now , to throw , Yeah . different things in different places , you know . So I just go , you know , we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and I 've just got three trash cans sitting in there , you know , we just kind of dump things in each one , if , you know , Yeah . if we get them , so . Those milk cartons take up so much room . Oh , they do , too . And they 're impossible to crush . I mean , you ca n't get the down to any size , you know . If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag , you know pretty easily , so . You know , I guess we kind of started recycling after I moved here about a year and a half ago . Oh , really . We were using baby food and there was so many baby food jars , Yeah . kind of what started it . Yeah . Some of our neighbors were doing it and so , you know , when I found out some places to take it , and , um , like , um , they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there , and I know that they 're going to use , you know , the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing . Oh , that will be good . Put lights and stuff so , you know , if I 'm not going to get the money for aluminum , I would just assume give it to the city of Flower Mound . Sure . to do something with , you know . Let somebody get something out of it . Yeah . That 's true . And they wo n't raise our taxes . Yeah . Yeah . Ha-ha . Well , I was kind of hoping with , you know , do you work for T I ? No , I do n't . I have a friend , No . of mine told me about this program , is the reason that I 'm , Yeah . There was a , T I has got this organization called T A D which is T I'ers Against Drugs . And , you know , we 're recycling aluminum cans up here and , uh , just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know , and that 's , they use the money from that to fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program . It 's , you know , T I does n't give them any money , all , everything is made from that . And they had talked about having a thing like , one Saturday a month , you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home , you know , Yeah . And I 'm kind of like , yeah . I shall , they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it , you know . That was going to use it for good , so , Sorry . Sounds like you have a little one just like I do . She 'll be two in July . Yeah . Mine was two in December . Oh . Well , it was good to talk to you . Well , it was nice to talk to you . I know they 've started over in Richardson where my dad lives . They pick up newspapers , I think . Oh , do they really . Curbside pick up ? Yeah . I really hope they do that in Louisville . It would make it a lot easier on all of us . MUMBLEx . Talk to you later . Okay . Bye-bye .
