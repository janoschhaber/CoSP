Uh , well , I 'm not sure how it is in Georgia , but in , in Pittsburgh the r- , the crime rate really is not very high at the moment . Is that , is that true for , for Atlanta ? Atlanta is kind of high . Uh , it 's , it 's lower than it has been in the past . Uh , I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off , 

and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher . Yeah , I , that 's probably not true only for Atlanta , but for just about anywhere . Yeah . Uh , what kind of crime problem do you usually run into ? 

Any specifics ? Well , uh , the least , what , from what 's on the news , uh , there are very few , like actual robberies reported , uh , uh , of , of residences . What 's more likely to occur is , uh , robbery of , uh , you know , knocking over a , a small store or a car theft , you know , it , things of that nature . Very few , uh , assaults , although on the college campuses , uh , there are , uh , cases of , you know , like people getting machine from a , from an automated teller and , you know , somebody trying to , to device a scam for , for , uh , getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners . Um . But mostly petty things and , n- , no , nothing , nothing really too big . Right , well , I guess here we run into that sometime , but I guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins -- Right . -- that type , not much home break ins . There are some , but not , not very high . Uh , as far as tellers and things like that , it 's not extremely high either . 

There were one case where , uh , this one guy , uh , was taking women from the teller and , and , you know , making them give him money and stuff and -- Uh-huh . -- then at the same time , raping them all , so , so that 's kind of like a double assault there . Yeah , 

uh , a strange case that , uh , that happened , oh , it 's about , about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine . Really ? It was a free standing machine and they backed up into it with a truck -- Uh-huh . -- and put it on the back and drove away with it . Oh , wow . Now , there 's a crime for you . Yeah , there 's a crime . Yeah , but , uh , I guess most of the things that happen around here are , are pretty , uh , innocuous . Although , uh , from what I hear in the news , 

and , and I , I s , saw an episode of the T V show , COPS -- Uh-huh . -- uh , one time that was in Pittsburgh , and , uh , it , it , it did surprise me , because , you know , they were doing drug arrests and thing , and things like that , 

but I , I do n't really think those things happen too often because , like I said , from what 's reported in the news , at least , it 's , it 's not all that common . Oh , okay . I do n't know , crime situations here , they , like I say , lot of , lot of cases is usually just apartments and , and break ins and things like that and a lot of it is due to drugs . Yeah . Uh , drug related , you know , in , in most cases , it 's not like , uh , it 's someone do steal a , a or television or V C R or something like that it is for drugs , you know , because you really ca n't on the street make any money off of it per se , you know , you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it -- Yeah . -- so you really not making a sizeable profit . 

So it 's not really lucrative to take chances like that , you know , even though it , it does exist . You know , I , just to diverge a little bit , uh , I live in an apartment . Right now I 'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh and , uh , the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in . Right . But , even so , it , I mean , it 's , it 's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to , to like lock the doors when they go out , you know , and things like -- Yeah . -- that . Uh-huh . Uh , it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just , you know , sit out back , take a look at when people are here and when they 're not -- Uh-huh . -- just come in , you know , there 's a T V and a V C R and , they could , uh , they could get in pretty easy and , and especially , uh , since there are bedrooms upstairs -- Uh-huh . -- and people leave the door open , you know , while they 're upstairs playing music , it could still happen then . Yeah , that 's true , but you 'd be surprised also how , much people watch you that even not , uh , participating in any type crime . I guess there was one case , I was surprised , uh , so happened this person worked at the same place , I work for Georgia Tech and they work at the same place I did , but I did n't know that they had been watching me because I was getting ready to , to go in my car one morning and the first thing they said is , uh , you must do n't have to be to work at eight , you know , 

like shock ,
