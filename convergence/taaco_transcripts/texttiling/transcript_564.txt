Right , uh , actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years , I lived in Germany and in Germany they do n't have the jury system . What they do is they have , uh , three judges , basically . And you get up there and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence and your defense attorney presents their evidence 

and those three guys take the evidence , go off , figure it out and then come back and say whether you 're guilty or not . Ou- , ou- , our judicial system is in such total chaos . I think what they need to do is , they need to somehow take the money out of it . I mean , when you have a man that 's signed a , a , a statement saying he 's guilty , we have a , a family called All day family . They were all murdered . Uh-huh . All the people signed confessions , they went to a trial by jury . They been trying these people now for twenty-two years , ever since I was a child . Wow . And what they 've done is they 've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they 've done , has nothing to do with justice whatsoever . Well , you know , it 's , it 's one of those things , I mean , uh , uh , I would have to look at it . I- , if they did it with the , uh , just the judges , the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day , they know all the procedures , they know what 's good and what is n't , they 'd be able to say , I 'm sorry , you ca n't use this as , uh , evidence , you know , because it was either illegally obtained or whatever and , you know , you would n't have this , uh , uh , theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the , to the jury and then the judge says , oh , no , d , disregard that . Come on , any jury 's not going to disregard the evidence , you know . Uh , that 's true . I , I , I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself . That may very well be . I , I hold it in the utmost contempt . Uh , The , uh , d- , my favorite is the police department , they 're not aimed at the criminal . The judicial system is aimed at the citizens because you and I , we have work schedules , we can be called at work , we have Social Security numbers , they can trace us down , we have telephones , then we have checkbooks . Criminals have none of these things . They 're real difficult to catch , and if they do catch them , they do n't get any monetary gain out of it , whereas us , we write a check . Yeah . So where do you think they target their efforts ? That 's true . You d- , They target their efforts toward the citizens -- Well , -- not the criminals . How would you go about changing it ? You know , that 's a , I 've nailed the problem down but I , Leave the details up to somebody else , huh . Yeah , I 'm going to have to leave those details like , what would you do about , I think , to begin with , you would h , you would have , like , here in Atlanta area , our crime rate is just astronomical , yet , you go out on the streets and they 're giving speeding tickets . Yeah . I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from , Well , you know , uh , talking about the lawyers , you know what might very well do , uh , cause a , uh , a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is to set the fees for cases . It 's kind of like do it , do it in the similar vein similar , like , uh , V C R or television repair . If you take your T V in , a lot of these T V repair places will say , well , I 'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars , and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that 's really tremendously wrong with it , then he eats it . He , he repairs it , gives it back to you , and takes your hundred dollars . Now , if he comes in and says , you know , I 'll repair your , your V C R , or somebody else 's V C R , for a hundred dollars , gets in there , maybe it 's a blown fuse , takes him two minutes , he fixes it , he still charges you that hundred dollars . So , maybe if we did that with the lawyers , so that , you know , whether it 's a murder case or a , you know , a civil , uh , somebody suing somebody else , you get X dollars for that case and that 's it . Now , None of this , I firmly believe in that because when you get the most heinous of crimes , have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney ? Oh , yeah . And here 's this bum that did n't have a job -- Yeah . -- and he 's got a attorney that you and I could never afford . That 's true . Who 's -- Yeah . -- paying for that ? Um , y- , well , you , you know , you 're talking to part of them that 's paying for that . Yeah , and you 're talking to the other half that 's paying for it That 's right . You know that 's , it , it 's , it 's amazing and , and when you stop and look at it , I mean , the judges , th- , they 're all former lawyers . Yeah , well , that 's another problem . I think to really correct the judicial system , you have to get the lawyers out of it . I mean , they 're , they 're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever , and with that type person running it , I mean , you , you could expect that you ,
