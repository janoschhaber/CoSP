Okay , MUMBLEx I missed a part of it . We 're to talk about what , lawns and gardens ? Lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do . I 'm , I 'm a putterer . I chose that topic because I really like gardening -- Uh-huh . -- as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard . Uh-huh . I , well , it 's , it 's , it 's very str , strange that I got this call because my wife just called me . 

I was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn -- Oh . -- and , you know , mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden , this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall , fall bulbs . Uh-huh . Uh . We 've had a late fall it seems like , the weather , in fact today it 's really warm , and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up , 

but you know you need to pretty soon . Well , that 's the way this was . The , the petunias were really great . Our mums are , are beautiful , Oh . Uh , I do n't know if we , I do n't think we 've had a frost up here . I 've been , I was down in MUMBLEx for a week , so I do n't know what happened last week -- Uh-huh . -- uh , but , uh , it seems like it 's , I do n't know if it 's late . I 'm sort of waiting for Indian Summer so I can get a lot of stuff down out here . Uh-huh . Uh , I , I enjoy it . We came here , we just moved into this , well , we moved in in November and put all , all the landscaping in this , this year . We came from nine years in a condo , uh , 

and working in that condo , you did n't have to do anything -- Uh-huh . -- you know , unless you really wanted to , so -- So now -- -- MUMBLEx . 

-- you have the chance to really create and , and spread out . Right . You know , I ca n't , this is my third , third house I think , I 've owned , um , but , uh , it 's interesting , you know , the only problem is that I do quite a bit of traveling , and it sort of gets away from me -- Uh-huh . -- if you 're not with it . So , but , uh , I , I enjoy most of it , and about this time of year there is , it starts getting a little old , 

and I start looking forward to , you know , having other things to do with my -- The grass -- -- MUMBLEx . -- not growing so fast . Well , it is , it is for me because I 've been doing a lot of fertilizing . We had a terrible summer , we had a drought -- Oh . -- and , uh , took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing , and now it 's really growing 

and I 'm trying to establish a good root , root growth -- Um -- -- you know , for the winter . -- ours seems to have slowed down here . We 're not having to mow every week religiously -- Really . -- but we 're still fighting bugs , and ready to change some of the , the summer flowers out -- Uh . -- I still have caladiums that are pretty , which is a surprise this late in the year . Oh , really ? Uh-huh . Um . But like today , it 's eighty-five degrees -- Oh , yeah -- -- it 's really strange , -- yeah , I hear that from , my brother-in-law lives in Plano , But that 'll change -- Yeah . -- real quick . Well , he always -- We 'll wish we 'd planted bulbs and pansies already . -- he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here and then he calls us , 

Oh , my gosh . yeah it 's seventy degrees here in the sunshine . So . Well , Texas has gotten to where it 's a real problem as far as plants , because our summers are so terribly hot -- MUMBLEx . -- and we have ice storms every year . And there just are n't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those -- Uh-huh . -- extremes . 

Some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they do n't make it through the two swings . Yeah , that is , I was , you know , I was like conditioned to it -- Uh-huh . -- they , they have to be hardened to it that 's , that 's strange with me . You know , you think , Dallas , you know , almost semitropical , you would n't have that kind of , that kind of problem , but , Well , for the most part we do n't , but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold . 

Well , the summers have gotten where they 're a lot hotter -- Uh-huh . -- but the , the ice storms really are stressful on all the , the plants that we have around . We 've noticed that crepe myrtles do n't do as well as they used to -- Really , oh do they . -- and , uh , pittosporum that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time -- Uh-huh . -- you , you -- I love , -- really take a chance with them freezing , Yeah , I love the , uh , the landscaping , like I say , my brother-in-law MUMBLEx . I get to Carrollton quite a bit . Uh-huh . I go there on business , and I really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens , and Texas is , D- , Dallas is very nice . I really enjoy it there . The landscaping , the homes , the architecture , the whole thing -- Uh-huh . -- very enjoyable gardens , and my wife and I , Except for the lack of trees , out where we are . Well . It was all cotton fields , and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful , we really miss it . Yeah , that we have , you know -- Uh-huh . -- Ohio 's a very pretty state . We moved , in seventy-six we moved to Chicago , we lived there for five years , and I remember the first time I took my wife there on a house hunt , uh , we were coming in and before the plane landed she looked out the window and she said , she said , MUMBLEx there 's no trees down there . MUMBLEx this is Illinois , you 're not . And , when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house , there were no trees -- Um . -- because the farmers had cleared all the land -- Uh-huh . -- and now all of a sudden it was being developed , and the first thing I did was planted all kinds of trees ,
