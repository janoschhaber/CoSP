Okay , so what kind of movies have you seen , lately , I guess ? Um , a lot , well , the last movie I saw , but it was n't my choice , was the NINJA TURTLE movie . Obviously you have kids . That 's right . Yeah , but my preference is the one we saw before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS . I have n't seen that one yet . That 's an excellent movie . 

Um , the last movie I saw was , uh , SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY . Oh , was that good . I heard , Uh , see , I 'm not a big Julie Roberts fan . Oh , okay . But I was a lot , I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be . Well , that 's good . It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be . Yeah . Yeah , 

it was a pretty good movie . SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat . I , I 'm ready to go . It just , it 's , you know , has n't worked out that way yet . Right . You know , it 's , uh , it looks good , you know -- Yeah , it is . -- if you like thrillers , anyway . Right . And I do . In fact , people I 've talked to said that they had n't slept real good for a while afterwards . So , Really . Oh , I love them like that . Yeah . I 'm not , I mean , I , I like all ranges of movies , but I like that where they run tense . Uh-huh . I really enjoy , they keep me guessing the whole time . It 's really , it was really interesting . Uh-huh . Well , what other movies have you seen then lately ? Oh . Other than the , I assume you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES . Yes , the new one , of course . Is that any good , I mean , I 'm sure I 'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives , and she 's got two boys that I took to see the first one . Oh . So I 'm sure I 'm going to see the next one here real soon . Amarillo . I did n't see the first one . My husband said it was , um , about the same lines . Oh , well , then it wo n't be too bad . So , yeah . You know , it was n't impressive necessarily , but it was better than it could have been . Right , right . And I was impressed with the fact that , um , it was n't that childish . Yeah . You know what I mean . It was n't , my daughter 's five , I mean she understood everything . She goes to almost all movies with us except , you know , R rated . And she really enjoyed it , but it was on a higher level , you know , where there were some things that kids did n't understand that adults did , and I liked that . Yeah , I think that 's important if you 're going , you know , if you 're going , uh , kids are going to , uh , parents are going to have to go -- Right . -- you ought to make it at least semi- , you know , semi for them too . That 's right , that 's right . Yeah . It 's pretty good . But we take her to just about every movie , and , she , uh , she does really good . We 've taken her from real young , and she does real good . Like I said , we do n't take her to R -s . Uh-huh . So , if and when we ever get a baby-sitter , like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS , we go see it . I 's about to say , you 're not going to take her to that one , I 'm sure . Oh , no , no . Do you take her , or do you go to a lot of comedy movies or to , Yeah , yeah . What was the last comedy you saw ? Oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw ? Huh , huh , huh . Good question , good question . We do n't get to go that often , but something on the tip of my tongue , and I ca n't think of which one it was . Uh . Gosh , I ca n't remember . The last , uh , in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw -- Uh-huh . -- I said that wrong , the last movie I saw was THE HARD WAY with Michael J . Fox . But that , that sounds good . Well , that really was n't too bad . There were , you know , he 's supposed , you know , he 's this actor , right -- Uh-huh . -- and he 's playing a cop . Right . Or he 's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff . I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop . Oh , okay . I mean , there , there were times when he was , like , he 'd be running with a gun or whatever . He did n't look like a cop when he did it . And I was so -- That 's neat . -- impressed with that because , you know , usually , The part was hard , to do that . Oh yeah , because , I mean , everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to , you know , to imitate them or whatever . Right . And , uh , I thought he did such an excellent job of not -- Yeah , -- going that far . Now , by the end he was looking more like a cop . Right . But at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part , you know , he was trying to , trying to get it , but he was n't there yet . Right . And you could tell it , and I guess that I thought was a real good acting and writing job both , you know , because I think , or directing job . I think they did a real good job of that . Uh-huh . And James Woods , I think is who it was , did an excellent job as the cop . I mean , you know , he just , Yeah , I like him . Yeah , and there were , there were some definite , um , should I say , tense moments , with him in there . Probably the last comedy we saw , now that I think about it , is HOME ALONE . Yes , I , I , I had seen it before Christmas , but I took a date to it , uh , about a month ago . So , I , I , I 've seen it the second time not too long ago . So . It was really cute . I really enjoyed it . Of course , the bad thing about it was , uh , the second time I saw it , I did n't really enjoy it as much , and I was kind of surprised at that . I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over . Yeah . But before , maybe it 's just the idea of my reaction to the first time . I had laughed so hard I was hoarse . Uh-huh , uh-huh . I really was , I was hoarse getting out of there . Yeah . And maybe I just laughed so hard the first time that I did n't have it , I mean , it just was n't as funny the second time -- Right . -- because I had just gone overboard the first time . I do n't know but , Maybe so , maybe so . Yeah , I mean , it was , it was a great movie though . I loved the movie . Yeah , I did , too . I 'm looking forward to this summer , uh , NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF is coming out . I love those movies . I do too . I mean , they are just slapstick . Oh , yeah . It , you have to see those twice to catch everything . Well , you have to see them more than that . Yeah , yeah . I , I , I still catch things in AIRPLANE that I did n't catch . Yeah . I mean , it 's amazing -- I do too . -- I love those movies -- I do too . -- I really do . So I 'm looking forward to seeing that -- Yeah . -- because that looks hilarious , as they all do . Oh yeah . Well , we , we try to go a couple times a month , I guess -- Uh-huh . -- to see a movie . It , it 's just getting so expensive . Oh , is n't it though . You know , but that 's at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper . But normally we do n't think about it until , That 's exactly what , I was going to say . I keep not doing it until after I 'm there and then all of a sudden I 'm saying I wish I 'd bought these things . I know , because we can go spend fifteen dollars -- Easily . -- just getting in -- Yeah , yeah , -- the three of us . And then if you want popcorn and stuff -- Yeah . I do n't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both . You know popcorn is not that expensive . No , nowhere near that expensive . So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke . And , it , it 's just the idea that these , uh , these actors , you know , live in such lavish style . I mean , it 's as simple as that . Yeah . We just keep breeding them . Yeah , and as long as we keep paying the money for it , they are going to keep paying them . I guess so . Now have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES ? Yes . Oh yeah . Oh , that was , that was an excellent movie . I have n't seen , we 're waiting for the video . No , do n't . No , really ? Do n't . That needs the big screen . Oh . It really and truly does , because to get the feeling -- Uh-huh . -- of like when the buffalos are , when they 're chasing the buffalos and everything -- Uh-huh . -- you 've got to be where you feel it . Oh really ? You really truly do . Oh . I would , I mean , I guess my first instinct was to wait for the video , too . But I 'm glad I did n't . I really and truly am . I mean , that mov- , that was one movie I came out impressed . Uh-huh . I really and truly did . I mean , I have absolutely no problems with them winning seven Oscars . None at all . Right . Normally I 'm one of these people that I do n't like one , one movie taking all the honors . Everythin- , yeah , yeah . I wanted him to win best actor on top of it , he was , Yeah , oh . Like I said , I would n't given the supporting actresses either one . Yeah . But even though they were okay , the girl in it , they , somebody made an interesting observation , now that I think back on it , I 'd say yeah , I ca n't believe that either . She was the only indian to have her hair done at all times . You know what I mean , you know . It was just too perfect at all times . Yeah . That was a mistake that they made . They should n't have done it . Yeah . Now the best , the supporting actor , he was good , but from what I heard , the guy who got it was better , so I , you know , I can see that . Yeah . But , oh , You think my daughter would like it ? Oh , well there are , there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side . Oh , okay . But , um , it 's it 's She does n't mind when we cover up her eyes . Okay , no problems . It , it 's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide , the hides . So there 's , See , that 's the one , that is the honest to God the one reason I do n't want to see the movie -- Yeah , but , well , -- is because I love buffalos for some weird reason , and I know they 're fake . And , and , of course , and , well , yeah , that , and plus , I mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt . So , I mean , they are killing buffalos in it . But they do n't stress that very much , they really do n't . Okay , okay . And I think it 's an excellent movie for , if , if she enjoys movies I think it 'll work pretty good . Oh , that 'll be good . We really need some , my husband keeps wanting to . It 's , it 's , it 's a long movie . Yeah , and I heard the video 's even going to be longer . Oh yeah . They did a lot of stuff that they cut out . I may have to see the video . Yeah , MUMBLEx that 's true , they said , I had n't even thought of that . Yeah , they said there 's a lot that had been edited , because of the length -- Uh-huh . -- and that they wanted in , so they 're going to put it in the video . Yeah . And that way you can watch it at your leisure . Well , yeah , I kind of like it when they do that , because the video , like I said , there are certain things you ca n't do with a video -- Yeah . -- and the idea that they may put a little extra in it I think is a good idea . Yeah , yeah . Because I mean when you rent a video , videos , of course , are not cheap either -- True . -- and so the idea of getting a little extra with it I think is a good idea . Because they , they make bundles of money off those things . I know it . Is n't that ridiculous . We have cable which -- Oh , I do too . -- helps a lot . Yeah , but not enough . Yeah , we keep holding out , you know . Yeah I 'm getting to the point where , you know , I watch , well I watch NICK AT NIGHT .
