Let 's see , mine 's pretty easy actually . Uh , I just got done reading a , a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the , uh , new Saturns . Uh-huh . Uh , and , although I ca n't afford it right now , I would just like love to have one . Oh , really , you like , uh , so you 're an American -- Well , -- you want to buy American . No , regardless of that fact . It 's the best car in the class for the be , cheapest amount of money . 

I 'm interested in having it for , uh , doing a little autocross racing , uh , closed circuit racing -- Um . -- and , uh , it seems to just blow the com- , compe- , competition away . It terms of handling , uh , acceleration , Handling , power , everything . Yeah , it just got like the top rating . It was compared up against , uh , let 's see , there was like the Mazda M X three , uh , Nissan 's , whatever , their two , N X two thousand , the Civic S I and it just , you know , it , it dominated over all of them . Everybody , all the , uh , raters loved it . I like the , I like the styling and , I seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it . What about Mustang G T -s ? Mustang G T -s ? Uh , ca n't afford it . Those , so you 're talking about ones in a lower , lower end , p- , price range . Right , yeah , I 'm a graduate student and , let 's face it , I do n't make any money so , 

Right . Well , you can wait till you graduate and you 'll have plenty of money , you can buy whatever you want . Yeah . Yeah , we 'll see then . Yeah , right now I 'm stuck , I , I 've got a , a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that , it 's fast , but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing . But it 's , it would be nice , just like scrap it and go for the g- , Saturn . 

Right , would you use that for city driving and racing ? Oh , yeah , I 'd do it , I 'd use it for both . The nice thing about autocrossing is you can , you can do both . Autocrossing is , what kind of track is that ? Uh , just like a , uh , set up a lot of times and it 's like really large , uh , parking lots . Okay . And you put up , set up the -- And pylons -- -- track , pylons . -- and things . Okay . Tight turns , hard acceleration . I 've seen a lot of Mustangs , uh , compete and it 's interesting . They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class . Oh , really ? Yeah . Yeah , I would guess so . Uh , what are you thinking about buying ? Uh , I think I 'd like to get , uh , B M W or if I go the German route , which I 'm kind of leaning towards right now , but , uh , or maybe a , Hon- , I mean , a , a Acura Legend . The Legend . Uh -- Uh . -- a Lexus , uh , S C three hundred maybe . Uh-huh . Something on that order . Yeah . You know , because your B M W -s , your German cars have good reputations , I think . Yeah , well , I was , I was actually in , uh , a lot of the B M W -s are produced in , uh , sh- , uh , Stutgardt and , uh , and Munich -- Yes . -- and I was , I was there this , uh , summer and , uh , i- , I was really impressed by the , uh , the , uh , factory , uh , tours and -- The , -- such for B M W . Yeah , they , their , they have the whole philosophy , I mean , they , they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they 're better , which is kind of hard to take . Yeah . I mean -- Uh , -- as you 're walking through that little tour in , uh , Munich , it 's kind of , they 're trying to brainwash you , too . Oh , of course , of course they are . They want you to buy their car . Yeah , there , it was , it was interesting . I was at , I , I also went to , uh , the Porsche and , uh , it was , it was amazing how they were completely opposed . Oh , really ? Yeah , the , uh , the B M W is really , oh , like , oh , we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and , and then you go to Porsche and it 's like , well , uh , these cars are completely handmade -- Um . -- and no two of them are alike . And -- Yeah that 's , -- so it 's like completely opposed . I do n't know , which do I like better , I think I like the Porsche 's philosophy a little bit better , although it 's not really practical . No , it 's not realistic . Unless , it 's , it 's a toy . Yeah , if you can -- Let 's face it . -- afford that kind of a toy , then , I guess , uh , Yeah , yeah , but it , it , B M W -s good for that . What kind of driving just like commuting you 'd want to do it , use it for ? Yeah , just work , short trips . No m- , no heavy mileage . I 'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year . Wow , yeah . So it 's pretty minimal . That 's cool . Lasts a long time . That 's mainly what I 'm looking for . Yeah , that 's good . I also , I was impressed by , uh , by the Mercedes , too . Oh , yeah . I really , I really like the Mercedes . But , The factory was nice and , But if , if you have a problem with a Mercedes , you take it into a shop , they 're going to , they 're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things . And is it different for the , for the B M W ? Uh , I think , well , something on the order of a three series , it 's probably different . Once you get up -- Probably . -- in the five series and higher , then , all your repair costs go up significantly . Right , I can -- So -- -- imagine that . -- I 'm kind , yeah , I 'm not sure if I really want ,
