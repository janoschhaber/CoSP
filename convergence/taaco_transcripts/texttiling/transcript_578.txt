Okay . Thanks . Huh . Do you all have a budget ? Well , uh , yeah , we , we do . Um , we 've been married for twenty-three years -- Uh-huh . -- and we have , uh , three teenage daughters and , you know , they 're very expensive . So , uh , uh , we , yeah , we have somewhat of , uh , a system . 

Uh , it 's , it 's kind of , uh , you know , it 's kind of hard to explain . Yeah . We 've actually gone , uh , just recently , to you know having , having two checking accounts . We always had just one . Uh-huh . And now we are having two . Uh , it 's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it 's very personal . Yeah . It 's , uh , So , I have to be . That 's that 's kind of the way I feel about it . Yeah . I usually , uh , my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances and of course , we 're ju- , like ther- , like a lot of people . We just scramble through month to month , you know . Yes . And , uh , Do you have a two income family or one income ? 

Uh , we have a two income -- Yeah . -- uh family . She also works -- Yeah . -- and , uh , but she , she enjoys it and she 's good at it . Uh , if it 's , if it 's , I am kind of , uh , uh , I 'm pretty bad about procrastinating -- Uh-huh . -- and one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe . Yeah . 

Yeah . You know how that goes , but , uh , uh , if , she , she handles it pretty well . She , uh -- So your wife , -- she writes all the checks , you know , once a month . Yes . It that what her , is her career , uh , related to , to finance or accounting ? Uh , sort of on a peripheral . She 's , uh , uh , an annuity administrator -- Oh . -- and so she , uh , she works for an insurance company . Uh-huh . But , but she enjoys it . She likes keeping track of all that stuff and , uh , Yeah , 

so that 's sort of related to her field a little bit . Yeah sort of . Yeah . And we , you know , we 've experimented with , with , uh , budgets , you know from time to time , uh , but , if , you know , you have to keep up with them . So a lot of times , we just , uh , just kind of play it by ear . 

We try to keep our , uh , our retirement and our savings kind of automated -- Yeah . -- so we never see that money . Just like taken directly . It 's just taking it out , right . Right . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . We do the same thing . And that , that 's kind of handy . Yeah , because if you do n't see it , you do n't miss it MUMBLEx . Yeah , if -- You do n't spend it . -- you have something to take it out . That 's exactly what we 've always done -- Yeah . -- and we 've had , uh , they 've always had , uh , where they match your funds , you know , 

sometimes -- Uh-huh . -- if you , if you save so much , then they will match it . Uh , that , you know , we 've done that too . But , my husband works for an insurance company -- Uh-huh . -- and he , he has now for about , oh gosh , how long has it been , ten years I guess . But he was with another company before that , but we have , we have , I , I work also , 

but I only have a part time job -- Uh-huh . -- and I get paid very little but , uh , you know , I try to use that money for food mo- , Jim gives me a certain amount money . You know , we just transfer it -- Yeah . Uh-huh . -- into my account and then I use that for food , household expenses , and then I add my own check to that and then with that I try and handle , you know , some of the clothes that the girls need -- Yeah . -- and things like that , but the expenses that we need and have around the house . Yeah . 

It -- So . -- sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do . Just kind of -- Yeah . -- play it by ear , but keep the , the deductions -- Yeah , we -- -- you know MUMBLEx . -- well Jim has , Jim has a budget . I mean he works it out every month -- Uh-huh . -- and breaks it all down . Uh , you know . I am given so much mon- , money a month , 

so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that . Uh-huh . So , I try not to , you know , we do n't , you know , I do n't ask for more . I mean I just try and make it on that . Uh-huh . Yeah . Because I think when you go to the grocery store , you can just , you can go crazy -- Yeah . -- with all the choices that you have -- Uh-huh . 

-- and , uh , you can , you can really waste a lot of money that way . Yeah . So , uh , well how long have you been married ? Uh , about five years . Yeah . Oh , yeah . So you 're just really getting started . So do you have a family too ? Uh , I 've got one little girl . She 's like , uh , nineteen months . Oh yeah . Yeah . So , uh , she 's , she 's not , uh , She has n't effected your budget yet really . Not , not really . Not too bad . Uh . No . Not like she will later on . Yeah . You will see that -- Yeah when , -- all of a sudden you 're paying , you 're trying to decide whether you are going to do , you know , soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do -- Uh-huh . -- and then you really have to start saying okay , now what can we afford -- Yeah . -- you know , what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more and , uh , but I think when we were back at your age , we did n't have much of a budget -- Yeah . -- and then as the girls got older , I think we , we did more and more of that . You know , more budgeting as as they got older . Uh-huh . Uh , but uh , but what do you do ? Do you , I 'm uh , I , I work for , I 'm an electronic technician . Oh , okay . I work at a , for a university . Uh , Georgia Tech , uh , research -- Oh . Well good . -- and , uh , Good . So I just , uh , Well , we just have , you know , we have a good friend that 's about to move to Atlanta . I guess we 're not suppose to talk about those things . I 'd better get back to the subject . Oh , well . But , uh , budgeting . I found , you know , I feel a lot better . You know , we use to work out of one check book -- Uh-huh . -- and it would be very hard for me because I would n't have , I would n't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month . Yeah . Now , I have , know exactly what I 'm spending and it 's so much easier ,
