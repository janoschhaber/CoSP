All right , uh , I , I would like to talk about , just briefly What happened over there in Saudi Arabia in the political context . I think it 's , uh , refreshing to see the , uh , the support that the President got from the American people . Yeah , it , we , I , I read an interesting article in the paper that discussed , uh , that , uh , seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like , uh , uh , President Carter and his thing with the , the hostage crisis , Right . and he always did it through rhetoric . Right . And this time President Bush did it through action 

and he , Um . he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support , Yes . or , uh , I mean , he left almost no alternative . That 's right . And , and it was very interesting how he did it and , uh , I mean , I 'm , I 'm an Air Force Officer , so it , uh , Really . it was interesting for me , uh , you know , I 'd certainly , uh , I , I mean I think it 's great that all the support . I have , uh , friends of mine from the Air , 

I 'm , I 'm an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory , Right . but other engi- , guys here on base , this is a B fifty-two base where I work , so , Yeah . we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there and they 're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it . That 's great , um , if , if you remember , the vote in the Congress to authorize war , if necessary , was actually pretty close . Yes it was . And if , if my memory serves me right , I believe a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it , 

it , it was , Yeah , I 'm , I do n't know the exact figure but I , I would imagine that because of the , how close the , the vote was I 'm , uh , I mean almost certainly would have to be . 

Just based on the sheer numbers of , uh , the disparity of , excuse me , Democrats and Republicans in Congress he 'd think that it would have to have been , um . That 's right . And , uh , I , I gosh this , uh , this whole thing now with all the , uh , all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how they 're , uh , uh , Yeah . they 're in , in a sad way for ninety-two now in terms of the presidential election , anyway . Especially the ones that came out and said , oh come on guys , let 's talk about this little while longer . Yeah , yeah . I mean how many years are we going to wait and , and what , what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time . Right , right , I think that was , all those factors played a part in , you know , uh , the , 

No doubt . everyone was discussing whether we should , uh , wait longer , but , I , I , I know that there 's a lot of reasons to wait longer but I think we were genuinely concerned about how , their military capability and we , uh , I think we over estimated it , but still , I think so too . we were really , highly concerned about it and , that we were worried that they were getting dug in and , uh . Well they were , Yeah . and in fact they were so well dug in that , uh , when we sent our tanks around behind them they could n't get turned around in time . Right , they could n't , yeah they could n't , yeah , it 's true they , 

Saddam thought he had the whole thing , uh , figured out to , to which way we were coming and which , what , what our doctrine was that , uh , Well , had , had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor . That 's right , that 's true . That 's interesting , I think , uh , this political situation over there now is , uh , uh , it 'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the , this opposition will , uh , uh , today the Turks , uh , agreed to support the Kurds , which is something they 've never done before Um , interesting . And , uh , this , and the Israelis , uh , and not the Israelis but the Arabs all of a sudden are , uh , are cheering for Baker on his drive for , to reconcile relations with the Israelis , 

so it 's like , Well , Baker is really not very much pro Israel . Yeah I , And did you know John Sununu is , uh , half Arab ? No , uh , I , I think I did hear that at one time a long time ago , Yeah . because I used to live in , uh , Massachusetts , but , uh , Right , in , in fact , when he was Governor of New Hampshire , I believe . Yeah , 

New Hampshire . Okay . I believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back . Oh my gosh . And , uh , now he is a conservative , 

but he is not a conservative that favors Israel , Uh . and that , that concerns me greatly . Well , I do n't , yeah , I 'd certainly , uh , support Israel in , in their , their policy that in defending themselves and in , uh , in their handling of their foreign policy , I think , I think the stand they have , or , or the way the command respect , I , I support that . I think that is a , a positive thing for them after , um , uh , thousands of years , they have to , uh , they ha , I think they in , when they be , became a country they more than , or , more or less decided they were n't going to take it anymore , 

and , uh . Well , they did n't have much choice , they could either fight or die . Yeah , exactly , exactly and , uh , um , so , gee , I lost my train of thought here . But , uh , um , so , okay so I ca n't say whether that , that I 'm pro Israel or anti Israel . I mean , I 'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region and looks uh , that the joining of forces for this , uh , uh , Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing . It is a positive thing , um , however , uh , every time an organization such as the P L O says well we 'll see if we can work with Israel , then , uh , they get embarrassed some , every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them . Right . And so you , you basically have , uh , mutually exclusive interests , either Israel is going to occupy the area , or the Arabs are going to occupy the area and I 'm just not sure that , that there 's going to be any easy permanent solution . Yeah , somebody 's going to , and I think that 's the problem the P L O has is that when they , whenever one group of them decides that they 're going to negotiate , or they 're going to do something , they 're going to try to make some peace , but , uh , the end result is that they , there so many factions of them and , uh , some more violent than others , some with a certain agenda different than the others , or they split , they end up being , becoming divisive themselves . Exactly . Uh , I , it 's interesting , It is . I , I 'm , I 'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months , but , uh , that 's , Yeah , I , I commend Israel for their restraint in not responding to the Scud attacks . Yeah , I know , that , that is almost , I mean that 's absolutely unprecedented that was , Yeah . an , an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the President and the State Department . Exactly , exactly . And that , I mean that 's never happened before , No . and I do n't know if it will ever happen again but , May not . Well it 's been fun , I enjo , enjoyed talking with you . Yeah , okay , uh , I guess , uh , well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time . You never know . All right . Bye , bye . 

Bye , bye .
