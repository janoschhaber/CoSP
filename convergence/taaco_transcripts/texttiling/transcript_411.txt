Okay , you ready ? Yeah , is that it ? That 's it . Okay , . Uh , well , we , I guess we have to talk about magazines and , uh , what , what , What , what kind do you subscribe to or do you ? Well , I subscribe to P- , well , I did subscribe to PEOPLE for a long time . I do , you know , I enjoy PEOPLE . 

And now I 'm , uh , I , uh , subscribe to , uh , LADIES HOME JOURNAL . I , uh , take a computer magazine . Uh-huh . And , uh , also , uh , BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS . Okay , are you interested in , in computers ? And my pet peeve with magazines -- Yeah . -- is all the little cards inside . And the cardboard pages . Uh-huh , yeah , well , that , that would be one of my peeves . My pet peeves with magazines , the woman 's magazines especially , I mean , it 's , it 's really geared to , all they have , you have too many recipes first of all . I just do n't , you know , that 's what I do n't like about LADIES HOME JOURNAL magazines . Too many recipes , too many , uh , can this marriage with saved nonsense . I , you know , I like to read articles about things that matter . Well , of course , PEOPLE magazine is not , you know , one of your , uh , your more intellectual magazines , but it 's nice , light reading . You know , if I want something intellectual , I usually read a book . Well , that 's true . I , uh , I like it when they have short stories . Like REDBOOK used to always have a good short story in it . Well , that 's true , yeah , they did . And I have n't bought a REDBOOK in a while , so I guess , Yeah . I , I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore . Well , is REDBOOK still in existence ? I do n't know if they 're , if they 're around anymore . Yeah . I think it is . it 's an institution , surely it would have to be . Yeah . But , Well , I 'll tell you , the only reason I bought the , uh , I subscribe to the JOURNAL is because of , which I think it was either , yeah , it was Publisher 's Clearinghouse , Right . They told me , you know , if I did n't subscribe they were going to take me off their , their winning , you know , their list . So , Mine , too . This was it , my last chance . Yeah , my last , right , my last chance to win ten million dollars , so I figured , hey , look . Well , I , I , For twelve dollars , you know , I went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that -- That 's it . -- uh , to , uh , ENTERTAINMENT . Oh , yeah , oh , uh-huh . And I was real disappointed with it . Yeah . I , I do n't know , it just , not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into . Right . It 's little short articles more than anything else . Uh-huh . And that 's one thing I do n't like about PEOPLE . Uh , it 's just , you know , does n't seem to have enough story to it . Well , I do n't know , I just think , uh , you know , it 's , If you 've only got a short time to read . It 's light reading . You know , you do n't have , well , you do n't have to concentrate , you know you know . No , that 's true . It 's entertaining , you know , and , uh , that 's , I just , I enjoy it , I , you know , I , uh . Well , that ENTERTAINMENT is , is very , was n't that similar , or is n't it similar to , to the TV GUIDE ? Uh , , no , not really . I mean , not the one I take now . It 's a , it 's a magazine and it goes into all the movies , previewing the movies -- Oh , uh-huh . -- that are going to be released or behind the scenes . Oh , I see . And , uh , I 'm a real movie buff , so that 's why I thought I might be interested in it , but it just has n't been what I thought it would be . Oh , uh-huh . And , uh , my mother has subscribed to , is the reason I get , uh , the HOME JOURNAL and the , uh , computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me . Oh . Otherwise , if , if I really want to take the time to read a magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf , I 'll pick it up then . Right , right . Rather than having them delivered and think , oh , I really need to read this . Well , I 'll tell you , since I 've been getting the JOURNAL , like maybe , maybe I 'll read two , maybe three , if I read three articles in , in , you know , one of the JOURNALs , I figure , you know , I did really well . Yeah , Because there 's just nothing in there that interests me . I do n't , you know , I do n't , I 'm not into , you know , recipes and , Well , I , I do like recipes and crafts . See , now , and I 'm not into crafts , so , you know , that , that eliminates , like three quarters of the magazine . You know . That 's true . Well , I just got the new issue , they have Bette Midler on the cover , so that should be one article that I 'll read anyway . Do you , uh ,
