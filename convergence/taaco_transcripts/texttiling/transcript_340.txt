Do you see anything wrong with public school systems ? Well , yes , I do . Um , I think I 'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to , to deal with in some quality way . I think maybe we 've given our teachers a almost impossible job . I agree . Do you ? Do you have children in the public school system ? Yes , 

and I taught for fourteen years -- Is that right . -- before we moved to Texas , and the , the one thing I see is changing is I was held accountable so much I had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students , and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that I was filling out all these forms -- You were a bookkeeper . -- for all the children -- Oh . -- everything had to be documented , and I had file cabinets that were n't filled with neat stuff for kids , 

it was filled with documentation -- Oh , no . -- yes . Well , um , I 'm , I have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back , and , and I 'm just really in a dilemma if that 's what , you know , I love to work with children and -- Me , too . -- to teach them , but I 'm really having questions if , if I can deal with that system and , and have a good conscience about , you know , what I do . I do n't think , I do n't think it 's the teachers , I think it 's the system -- I think so too . -- but , um . They 're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now -- Right . -- and teacher competency , you know , and it 's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best , she 's always worried who 's looking over her shoulder 

and , What child 's going to say something -- That 's right . -- some parent 's going to overreact to -- I know . -- that 's , that 's true . Well , it 's , it 's hard on the children too , I think , you know , because the , um , the teachers are overworked and just like a mommy that 's overworked -- That 's right . -- you 're not at your best , you know , um . 

Do you have children in the system ? I have two , I have , in the system one is in ninth grade and one is in seventh grade , and them , um , I 'm home schooling my kindergartner this year . Oh . We , um , live in a district that has open classrooms , and I was n't particularly comfortable with that for her . Yep . Are you in Plano ? Yes . Yep , I am too . You too . And I have one in ninth grade at Clark and one at Hendrick this year , and he , my nin , my , uh , sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews , and the very first year I taught back in seventy-three , we had open classroom 

and it did n't work then -- Oh . -- and when we moved down here , I was just appalled that they were still doing -- 

Still at it . -- it here , Well the explanation I was , was given about , you know , they , they seemed to admit that it was n't working , but they did n't have the money to restructure , but looks to me that it would n't take really that much money to at least come up with , I mean , some kind of partitions -- Partitions -- -- you know , -- or just to face the children different directions or to do something -- Just , yeah . -- I know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school -- Oh , goodness . -- so he spent all day -- Oh . -- in this one large open area , so , I did n't really care for that . 

It seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here . Were they ? That was our last tour , in Michigan . Well , we were from North , um , Carolina , and of course North , North Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education . I think they rank about forty-ninth -- Oh . -- but our children got a very good education there -- Uh-huh . -- they were in the magnet school program , and a lot of their classes , from the time they were about third grade , they , they changed classes several times during the day , which has its pros and cons , 

but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes -- Oh , wow . -- and it was wonderful -- Yes . -- so , you know , I 'm coming to , to Plano thinking , Well , gosh , it 's going to be really great , it 's ranked so much better . Yes , that 's right . We heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system . Is n't that interesting , I , I , I do n't understand how they get this , this reputation unless it 's just that they spend a lot of money , I do n't know . Probably so , on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are -- I guess so . -- so . Well , my son is at Clark this year too , so , uh , we 're As a freshman ? Yeah . Yep . And , uh , he 's pleased with his classes . I , I , I do n't guess I 've been in the high school long enough to , to know what to expect really -- Yeah . -- you know , how to judge it . My daughter seems to be having a good time , she was absent with strep throat the last three days , and I ran over and picked up her report card , and she did very good , so -- Well , that 's good . -- and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work I would expect -- Yeah . -- for a freshman to have . She 's not bogged down , but yet she has some every night . Well , Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he does n't have any , so , that 's interesting , but , he , his grades , I have n't seen them yet , but supposedly they 're good , so , Yes , you always hear how good . Now my son 's at , junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful but , who knows what he 's going to bring home . That 's right .
