Here goes Sharon . Okay . Well , what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars ? That 's the only thing I found out tonight . Oh , you found that out tonight ? Yeah . I have n't even heard that , that 's great . I think he deserves every penny of it . Yeah . But , there are some others out there that I do n't believe deserve the money they 're getting . Well , is n't it funny how baseball 's getting less than like football players would . 

Oh , yeah . Wonder because football , And they play a lot , they play a lot longer season , too . And a lot more games , right ? Yeah , that 's exactly right . Uh-huh . But I think , let 's see , the teams that were there last year were , see , somebody from California , I do n't even know who won the pennant last year . Beats me . I mean , I know Yankees have won a lot games . Yeah . through the years . Not lately though . We have been talking about this , I tried to call earlier , Uh-huh . and we had made a list of all these , uh , baseball teams and the cities that they were from , MUMBLEx then I started cleaning 

and I do n't even know where I even put that paper . Threw it away . Yeah . I was just cleaning and throwing , Oh , gosh . Let 's see . The teams that , I think the A 's were in it last year . The Oakland A 's , and I think it was , I do n't think it was an all California baseball . Well , have you ever played baseball ? I played softball . Well , that 's what I did when I was growing up . Yeah . That was fun . Yeah , that 's fun . That 's a whole different sport . 

Uh-huh . Yeah , let 's see , but I think , I think the Rangers need to go and I think the Pirates will go . And , uh , let 's see , Rangers have got a new guy this year , I do n't even remember his name either . Do you ever go see the Rangers ? Every once in a while I , I like to go on the nights when there 's not anybody out there , not very many people out there . 

It 's a lot more fun when you 're not fighting a crowd . Yeah . I think it 's fun , I like just looking at the billboards . Yeah . B- , sometimes when I , if you go out there during the day , you just fry under the sun . Yeah , it 's nice at night . Yeah . That 's when I 've been . It is . Well , And do you know anything about that new stadium , 

have you seen all those pictures that they 're going to put out there ? No . Yeah , that , that huge it 's suppose to be a huge stadium and it 's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it . And , uh , they 're going to try to make it a real community center out there . Cou- , And you 're going to be able to buy your , what was , no , wait MUMBLEx about the liquor ? 

That 's , that 's in , uh , Texas stadium where the football players , Oh , yeah , so you , play and they 're never going to let liquor in there . Well , they 're trying . I know , but they try every year and every year they get thrown out . It 's so stupid because they let you take it in there , but they do n't , they do n't allow you to sell it , do n't allow them to sell it there . Uh-huh . But , uh , that new stadium 's going to be real nice , and I heard that there 's , uh , that you can bid on that stadium last night on the news I heard that they said you could , you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you , so . Uh-huh , right . And it 's going to go to the highest bidder . 

Oh . Well , that 's the way to do it . Yeah , so that could be your , you know , fifteen minutes of fame . You hear that ? . That 's my kids turning on their music . MUMBLEx . Oh . Holly turn it down . I think it 's the Bart man , the Simpsons . 

Oh , God . I stay away from them . I wish I could . I bet you do . Well , where are you ? In Plano . Okay , I 'm in Garland . Oh , you are ? Yeah , my h- , my husband teaches in Plano . Oh , what 's he teach ? C V A E . Uh-huh . So , what do you do ? I teach , but I teach for Dallas . Oh , you do ? For right now . I 'm trying to get out . Is that a tough system to be in ? Uh-huh . Real hard ? Uh-huh . Yeah , I would think it , I mean it 's good because they , they try new things , you know , but it 's like , they 'll try something and then they throw it out , and get something else , you know , Yeah . and you get tired of that . That 's typical bureaucracy though . That 's , that 's , I think it 's going to be any where you go it 's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones , 

Yeah . I do n't know , sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad . Well , but they ca n't be though , they do n't have as much money . Yeah , Most of the time . but the politics , the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes . Oh man , in Dallas you do n't even know who 's in , in administration , there 's so many of them . You do n't even know who to payoff , huh ? . I mean , somebody walks in the , a classroom and you do n't know what they 're there for , you know , when they 're coming , how long they 're going to be , Yeah , oh , how funny . you know , it 's just MUMBLEx there they are and they 're writing the whole time . No communication whatsoever . No . I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything , and I finally just got to where I go , okay , I 'm Debbie Moore , you know , may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for , you know . Yeah . Because , you know , you never know where they are going what they 'll report or , I know . and they 'll tell you they 've written something down , and you hope they 're telling you the truth . And you never see it . No , huh-uh . That 's got to be frustrating . Oh , it is . How long you taught , taught in Dallas schools ? Uh , this is my eleventh year . Ugh , that 's about , uh , ten too many . No , actually it 's , now my job 's good , Yeah . much better than a lot , Uh-huh . because I 'm Chapter One , Yeah . and all I do is teach reading all day long , Oh . and it 's just ten children at a time . Oh , well , that 's not bad . No . It 's good , and you 've got a lot of federal money , too . But has n't it changed a lot over the years ? Teaching ? . Yeah . Oh , yes . Or working in the system . Yes , when I first started teaching , I remember I went to my MUMBLEx and I said , okay , I want to see a curriculum guide , you know , so I 'll know what I 'm suppose to teach and they go , we do n't have one . We do n't even know where one is . Oh , God . And so I go , okay , I mean , you just , you did , what you wanted to do , How funny . and now they tell you what to teach and how long and , you know , what day , Yeah , you do n't know which is , what period . you do n't know , which is worse . Yeah . No , I know which is worse . Yeah , I guess so . Yeah , being told what to do is worse . Uh-huh . So , how long are we suppose to talk for ? Well , you can talk for ten minutes but you do n't have to . Oh , you can ? Yeah , and no , if you talk to ten then they come ov- , on and say , oh , you 've extended your limit , and please say good-bye within the next five seconds . Oh , I have n't ever talked that long . Well , you know , I had n't either till last night , I was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland , Ohio , Uh-huh . and we started talking about gangs , you know . He lives in Cleveland ? Yeah . Wow . And , everybody else that I 've talked to has been right around here . Yeah . But , she was real interesting . Huh . And then tonight this woman called , have you taken any incoming calls ? Th- , yours is my second one . Okay . So hers was the first one I got , gotten and , uh , and she was telling me all her problems , you know , and it went over ten minutes . Did she , did she , did you all not talk about the topic at all ? Well , yeah , we did , but the topic was boring I thought . Oh . What would you serve , uh , if you were having a dinner party ? Oh , gosh , MUMBLEx all the other , the one I talked about the other night was good , it was , um , about movies , you know , what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that . Oh yeah , I could go on and on about that . Me , too , because we go all the time , the guy I was talking to never goes , he was , boy it sounds like you 're really up on this . I said , I see at least two a week . Ugh , neat . So , that was real good to talk about that . Have you seen like , uh , SILENCE OF THE LAMBS ? No . You 've got to go see that . The last one I saw was DANCES OF THE , WITH THE WOLVES , MUMBLEx WOLVES . Yeah , we talked about that one too . And he , he said he did n't think it should have gotten all those awards , he thought it was too long but I , Oh , I enjoyed it . I did , too . I mean , it was just more for my money . Yeah . I did n't think it was too long at all . Uh , he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch . Huh . The other one you need to go see is SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY . Uh-huh . And , how old are your kids ? One is eight and one is eleven . You probably do n't want to take them to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS . It 's , it 's not , it 's not too cool for kids . They usually pick their own . I bet they do . You know , they 've got it all figured out . Yeah , they want to see all the horror movies . Well , and Ninja Turtles . Yeah , Ninja Turtles , got to have those . But most of the time really we watch them on the video . Oh , yeah , you brin , that 's , Do n't you ? Just massive rental . well heck , that 's a lot cheaper then , uh , Going to , taking them out to the show . I know . Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you do n't have to watch them all in one ni- , one time . That 's what we do , especially when it 's bad weather , man , just , Yeah . plug it in . Of course , you have to get there early if you want to get anything , I know . decent . It 's good when you go to Tom Thumb though and they 're cheap and nobody has got them yet . That 's true . Unbelievable . That 's true . We saw , um , HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS , tonight . Uh-huh . It was okay , it was kind of slow , and I felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end , you know . It just , it , I do n't know , it one of those movies it 's not going to be around long , it will be a dollar movie in no time . Do you read ? Not very much , no . No ? I do n't have the patience to read . See I do that to make myself go to sleep at night . Yeah . Oh , my Mom and Dad read all the time . You saw FIELD OF DREAMS , right , a long time ago ? Yeah , sure did . Well , I was reading the book , and it 's called SHOELESS JOE . Oh , really ? It was so wonderful . And then I was , um , I decided , well , I like this author , so I got a , uh , book of his short stories , and that 's been real good . Who is the , is the author ? Do n't , do n't ask me . Oh . The GHOST OF SHOELESS JOE was the name of the book . Shoeless Joe . Was it like the movie ? Yes , Okay . quite a , quite a bit . But , you know , in the movie the guy was black , Right . he was n't in the book , Huh . that 's one difference . There really was n't a lot of difference . I did n't , see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie . That 's interesting . That was a good movie , too . Well , do you think we covered baseball ? I think so . Okay , well , have a good night .
