Well my exercise program consists of , uh , you know , 

it 's , it 's a opportunity to stay alive really . Huh . Instead of , you know , wasting my , my , the , you know , the , trying to exist on the latency of my youth , the good health of my youth . I 'm , and what I like to do is I like to stretch out and I like to run , uh , m- , I 'm , I like to run , get my heartbeat up . I like to run about , oh , about two , two and a half miles . And then I like to work out on , uh , on the , uh , the Bailey Life C- , Cycle machines up here at the , at the Holiday Spa . And , and I , I think that , you know , I 've had a regiment now for about , you know , ten , fifteen years of , of doing that and , uh , and I , I kind of think it 's , uh , it 's a lot of work but I think it 's , uh , it 's a lot of work but I think it 's , uh , it 's the , uh , the amount of effort that 's required to , uh , to stay healthy , you know . I have a sedentary job 

and , uh , unless you do something like that , y- , you 're going to get sick . Right . Yeah , I 'm , I need to get , I 'm , I 'm pretty bad about that . I 'm lazy . I should , I know I want , I always say that I need to get run- , start running and I 'm going to try and do that this summer . Because I never have time . I , I always put it off . By the time I get back from classes it 's late at night and I do n't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever . Because I 'm , I 'm getting a gut here . 

I got to get back into shape . Well , I , uh , two years ago I started having trouble with my knee . And , uh , you know , I 've got , you know , I figured well , it 'll go away . Well I s- , you know , I 'm , I 've had to reduce my program , reduce my program and I 've gained fifteen pounds . Huh . And so , uh , you know , it 's , e- , you know , I need to get back into swimming , you know , instead of running . If I ca n't swim or I ca n't run , I should be able to swim . Well I 'm such a terrible swimmer and I , I , I really feel I can , I can dedicate about an hour , an hour and fifteen minutes f- , to this effort . 

But if it gets longer than that I , I , i- , it , I start not doing anything . Yeah . And so , so I got a real problem in that regard . Uh , it , do , you obviously are , are not an exercise buff or else you 'd be out there doing it . Yeah . I mean , I do it , I guess , I 'm going to do it , uh , because I want to get in shape . I 'm not , it 's not something I really enjoy all that much that , I 'll , I 'll probably , 

I mean once I get into it and I , if I , if I get into better shape then it 'll be , it wo n't be as much of a , a chore to me . Well , it 's , it 's always a chore . I mean -- Yeah . -- I started doing this when I was about thirty-five -- Huh . -- and now I 'm fifty-five . Yeah . And , uh , you know , I , I know that in , MUMBLEx I just know that I 'm going to get blown away with some , some piece of nonsense . Y- , you know , some health related thing is going to blow me away . That 's the same way , I got too much weight on right now . 

I -- Right . -- need to lose fifty pounds , you know . I need to lose at least twenty , you know . But , uh , you know , it 's , it 's just , uh , I 'm busy . I 'm doing a lot of traveling and , uh , it , it creates a problem , uh , you know , when you 're on the road . What sort of , uh , uh , what other programs other than say running ? 

Have you , have you ever done anything at all ? Yeah , I have . Uh , sit-ups or , al- , also last summer I was doing Nautilus or last year I 'm , uh , belong to a club right here . Uh-huh . That was a little bit too much money . 

But , uh , doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights . I like that . MUMBLEx club , what club are you with ? I 'm sorry ? What club were you with ? It 's called , oh , what was it called . City Sports , downtown Washington . Oh . Okay . So you 're , you 're down , you 're downtown . Yeah . I 'm at , I 'm at , I go to George Washington University . Okay . Yeah . You 're down there on , you know , twentieth and eighteenth and -- Yeah . -- F G . It 's MUMBLEx , uh , Plaza . Oh . Well , I 'd , uh , well there 's a , there 's a Holiday Spa down there on , on K street , I think . Something like that . But , uh , I , I go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria and that 's pretty good . But , you know , evening time it gets pretty busy . But generally , you know , I can , I can get in and get a program , you know . Right . But , uh , you know , I , I need to , I need to rededicate myself to , uh , to doing this and , uh , I got a problem , uh , you know , ever since my knee went bad , of getting back solidly into it . I mean , I 've been doing this for fifteen , twenty years . Yeah . And , you know , and I 'm , I know I 'm going to get , I know it 's going to bite me in the ass and so I , I really do n't want to , want to , uh , you know , back off on it . Yeah . It 's something , I think , uh , I 'm young , I should get started getting into shape . I do n't want to , I want , I mean at one point it 's going to be too late to do it . MUMBLEx . Well , no . When you 're young , you , you can abuse your , your , all your systems and you can recover . Yeah . Uh , when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems , you get blown away . Huh . And just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye , you know . And , uh , and so the object ,
