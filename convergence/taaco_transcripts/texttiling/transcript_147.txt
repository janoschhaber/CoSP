What kind of lawn and garden work do you do ? . Well , right now the place where I 'm living , the yard was basically neglected for about the last twenty-five years , so I 've been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn , and after three years of working at it , I 've , I 've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back . Instead of mowing in the same direction every time , changing , one day you 'll , or one time you 'll cut it , cut the lawn the long way , then you 'll go the opposite way , instead of going lengthways , you go width , 

and it helps the grass come back . Oh , does it really ? I did n't know that . Did , um , you 've been working on it for three years ? Thr- , f- , for three years . Really ? What have you done ? . Killing lots of fire ants . I was firmly convinced the entire , front yard was nothing but one gigantic ant mound . Uh-huh . Because it was like , you could , you could n't even stand still out there . You know , I can barely hear you . Is this better ? Yeah , a little bit , yeah . It was like you 'd go out in the yard to water something , you 'd just be standing still . Uh-huh . And the ants would start crawling up your legs . It 's like , I 'm not standing in a mound , though . Oh , wow . How did you get rid of them ? Uh , Dursban Two . Pardon ? A chemical called Dursban Two , Oh , Dursban Two , it 's a crystal . yeah , Dursban will get rid of just about anything , I think . But um , so you have n't had a problem with that , since ? Um , not bad . Every , Yeah . once in a while you 'll have a mound pop up , but that 's , gon- , to be expected . What else did it , did it kill anything else it was n't supposed to ? Um , Not really . as far as I can tell it has n't killed anything it was n't supposed to . Even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds -- Yeah . -- it did n't kill it . Really ? Well , that 's pretty wild . Yeah , we used it for fleas . We had fleas in our yard real bad last year , and we did that um , I just , I 'm not , basically , I like to mow the lawn , believe it or not , but I sometimes have problems starting the mower , so a lot of times I wo n't get out and do it , but my husband , basically , does most of it , and he does the , you know , edging and all that kind of thing , and we 're renting , and so we do n't really put a lot of money into the , uh , you know , like this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt , and some Saint Augustine . We just , we have winter rye out back , and we have , I do n't even know what it is out front , but , um , we , this is the first house we 've ever lived in , and we 're just not real into the lawn probably because we 're renting , I guess , huh ? So , it , anyway , Well , you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard ? Right . Uh-huh . We were getting , Uh , I found one thing that , it 's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn , but , every time I 've done it , it 's got , it , it drives the fleas completely out of the area . What ? Powdered sulphur . Oh , really ? Hm , I wonder why it does ? You , you do n't have to put a whole lot out , just if you 've got a broadcast spreader -- Uh-huh . -- I think it comes in a forty-pound bag , and it 's real fine , like flour -- Uh-huh . -- and you just -- Yeah . -- go out , and do the entire yard , and you , I mean , you do n't have to put clumps of it , just very lightly cover the entire yard . Really ? Well , I 'll have to remember that , because hopefully we wo n't have them this year , but we have a cat that comes in and out , and the cat was getting , um , fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house , so we had a real problem last year with fleas , and uh , it was quite a drag because , um , we got them in our house , and we 're Christians , and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas , and we got rid of them , believe it or not , with smoke bombs , which is just about impossible to do , but we did , and so we do n't want them back this year , you know ? so I 'll remember that if we see it 's a problem in the yard . we 're almost , they were so bad last year , even ticks . I do n't know , we 've had ticks before a lot , and we 've had to get out and treat our lawn for that . I think we used Dursban for the , we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing , you know , and spread it all out everywhere , but that 's about the extent of our lawn care . So , I do n't know , do you enjoy doing it ? Oh , I love it . My wife ca n't understand it 'd be a hundred degrees outside , I 'll be out there . But it 's too hot to be working in the yard . I 'm under the trees , I 'm having fun , and I 'm stopping to drink water , so what 's the problem ? . Yeah , well that 's , well that 's funny . Yeah , not everybody enjoys it , though . Everybody has a different thing . I kind of enjoy it and my husband does n't . I kind of have to , sometimes I 'm too busy to get out there and do it , and he , you know , he does n't really enjoy doing it , but he 'll do it , and he does n't gripe about it or anything , but , you know , I 'm kind of like you and he 's kind of like your wife . I mean , you know , in that he does n't really enjoy it , but I would like to have a garden , you know , that 's my thing , but right now where we 're living we have the trees where their , uh , roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground . I do n't know what kind of trees they are , but you ca n't have a garden , you ca n't till it , or it 'll , it 'll tear up a nice tiller . So we 're going to wait until we move . We do n't have a lot of sun , either , because it 's big trees back there . So we 're going to wait , and when we move that 's one of our priorities , is to get a house where we can have a , uh , garden . And so I 'd like to do that . I have a feeling I 'll be out there all the time taking care of that , but that 's our next thing . Do you have a garden ? I 've got , the , this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at . Uh-huh . Sitting on about a two acre lot now , and half of it 's , the back half is my garden . Oh , are you kidding ? That sounds fun . Where do you all live ? Uh , in Missouri City . Oh , really , wh- , Southwest , southwest side of Houston . Southwest where ? Southwest Houston . Oh , really ? Oh , because we 're in Dallas . I guess I assumed you were here . Well , that 's neat . And , um , yeah that 's what we want . We have a , yeah , that 's really what we want , but we just have n't been able to do that yet , so one day we 'll be able to do it , and I 'm excited about it . And then I do n't know anything about it , I have to learn , and then you 'll have to give me a call on gardening . What do you do in your garden , and I 'll go nothing , what should I do ? But anyway , I guess that 's about it though . It sounds like we 've covered all the bases so I guess we 'll let you go , and , um , do you have anything else you wanted to say ? Uh , no , it 's just , Okay . I 've had an en , very enjoyable conversation with you . I know , you too . I hope you have a nice day , and -- Okay , you too . -- we 'll talk to you later . Okay . Bye . Bye .
