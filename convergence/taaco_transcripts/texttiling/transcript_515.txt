Well Jackie , uh , on taxes , I , I guess I would have to say , that I , that my opinion is that I do think Americans are paying too much in taxes . Uh , what 's your feeling about that ? I agree . I think taxes are high . Right , uh , where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both ? Oh , yes . Uh-huh . Uh , uh-huh . In New Hampshire we have , uh , uh , no , no , what we call broad base taxes . No income tax and no sales tax . Huh . Uh , we tax business , uh , eight percent , businesses are taxed eight percent 

and we have what we call the five B s . Uh , th- , for our taxes . Booze , uh , butts , cigarettes , beds , uh , hotel room tax -- Uh-huh . -- bellies , a meal tax and bets , gambling . Oh . So , uh , we do have a very low tax rate , but you know , combined with the federal income tax . I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes 

and MUMBLEx . Right . Yeah , I , I agree and I , MUMBLEx think it 's about the time of the year when you just start getting , well if you do get money back from like jobs , I 'm still a student -- Uh-huh . -- so , uh , I only work part time , so I , I get a check back so -- Well that 's nice . -- from , from taxes but , Nice , nice to get a refund . Yeah . It is , but it 's not much . So . Uh-huh . Do you think that , uh , for whatever taxes we do pay that , uh , we are getting value for it ? No . Yeah . Uh , my , my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state and they say they are going to send some back , 

it 's like giving yourself a tra- , it 's like one arm giving the other a transfusion . Yeah . You know what I mean ? Yeah . Uh , it , it really , uh , 

I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because , Yeah . There you go . Right because , uh , there 's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there 's a fly paper effect and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol , uh , a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you . Right , yeah . I do n't know . I , do n't seem like they are doing much with it , MUMBLEx I mean there 's plans there and now that they are voting and people , you know , getting into MUMBLEx drug and that stuff . Uh-huh . They have nice plans and , uh , but , they do n't always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and I do n't what happens with all the money because if their plans do n't work , you know , but taxes get raise so . I do n't know . I 'm not really into politics , uh -- That it , -- I do n't really understand it -- Uh-huh . -- but it 's just you know , Well , it does it , it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend . Uh , it 's almost like they will spend as much as the , they 're allowed to collect . You know . Right . Uh , there is an interesting proposal that 's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax . Uh , ten percent or thirteen percent . There would be no figuring . I mean you would take your income tax , you would have a certain amount , I mean you would take you total salary -- Uh-huh . -- those who made under a certain amount would n't owe any taxes , and then there would be a set amount for however many people , you know , dependent you have , and you would just pay a flat tax . No exemptions , no deductions or anything else after you know , after you figure up who 's in your family . Right . Huh . And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with . Yeah . The could be nice . Yeah . Huh . I , I 'd like to see something like that . I think it would be fairer and it would put a , you know , a lot of the tax attorneys our of business and I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail , but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans . Right , yeah . I mean it does n't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes . Right , huh . It does n't seem fair to me . Yeah , it is n't , there is not much out there that is fair , that 's for sure . Right . Huh . I will agree to that . I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high . I , I , if I am not mistaken , are n't they ? I -- Uh , -- mean for your state . What is , do you know what your state income tax rate is ? Um , no -- Twenty percent ? -- I , I have no idea , I just . My dad does it all for me . Just , you just pay it , huh . I use , You 're like , you 're like my daughter who is in college down in Massachusetts and , uh , she works as a waitress and she is attending college full time also -- Uh-huh . -- and she sends her taxes to me and I figure them up . She really has no idea . She gets a refund check and ,
