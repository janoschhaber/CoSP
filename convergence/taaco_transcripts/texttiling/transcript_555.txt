You have any pets ? Do I have pets ? Yeah . Yes , I have a cat and I have two dogs . Two dogs , what kind ? I have a Schnauzer and I have a Sheltie . Schnauzers . Is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer ? It , it 's a miniature . Uh . Uh-huh . 

I 'm going into all this because I used to w- , I just got done working at a pet shop actually . Oh , okay . Yeah . Well , the Schnauzer I 'm , I 'm watching for one of , uh , the managers where I work and he 's been transferred to Germany for a while -- Uh . -- and I 'm taking care of his dog and , uh , and I had just got the kitten when he asked me that and he says , well , my dog does n't like cats , and I said , well , we wo n't tell him it 's a c- , we wo n't tell her it 's a cat , because it was a kitten , and , you know , they just , they just love kittens . Yeah . They just are fascinated . Oh , yeah . So she does n't know that this is a cat yet . That 's good . They say , And they get along real good . I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty , he 'd flip . So that was interesting . Did n't expect that would happen . Yeah , that 's cool , that 's nice . Uh , let 's see , what was the other dog you had ? It 's a sheltie . Oh , a sheltie . She 's real s , sweet little dog . She 's got a very nice temperament . Uh , they 're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer . Yeah . You know , the Schnauzers are a little aggressive . They can be nippy . Uh-huh . Yeah , shelties are nice . Everybody seems to be really happy with them . They 're good temperament . They 're a good temperament -- They put up with a lot . -- and they , and they just , uh , they , I think they have a good head on their shoulders . I think they have a , a higher level of intelligence than other , uh , dogs that I have encountered . Schnauzers , in particular probably . Well , yeah , but also some poodles , uh -- Oh , yeah . -- they 're kind of , there are some smart ones out there , but there 's some also some , uh , not so smart ones . Yeah , I g- , it seems the smaller the are , the , the worse off they are . Yeah , that 's , that 's , maybe that 's , there 's , uh , some credence in that statement . Yeah , the- , they 're bred down so much . It 's , Uh-huh . They are n't the best pets . I , I 'd , I really do n't know -- Yeah . -- what the best pet is . I guess it 's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal . Yeah , I mean , some people seem fairly well suited for -- -- for , uh , miniature poodles and such . And bull dogs . But I do n't know about these , uh , these , uh , uh , these pincers , these , now , what are they called . Pit bulls , pit bulls -- Pit bull . -- that are so vicious . They might , they 're actually very friendly dogs . Are they really ? I do n't think I 've ever -- Uh , they 're really nice . -- seen one . I , I 've dealt with quite a few of them . People , uh , customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like , they , uh , fit collars and stuff on them and they are , they are just really nice , really friendly , uh , kind of like medium intelligence . Uh , Well , how do they become s- , w- , how did they get their reputation , then ? Well , because some people , uh , want to train them as , Oh , they train them to be that way , then . Yeah . Oh , okay . You really ca n't get a pit bull from birth that 's that way . Oh , okay . Yeah , it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really -- Oh , dear , so the -- -- respond . -- the poor animal is doing it in self protection . Right . Oh , dear . Yeah , they are n't , they are n't by nature really nasty critters . They are very determined critters -- Uh-huh . -- and so once you get them going , it 's not good to , to deal with , but , they , I , I really like them . I was , I was impressed by them . They 're , they 're real sturdy little critters and they are n't that big . Uh-huh . And , uh , just really friendly . Well , that 's unusual . I was , I was -- I , -- overwhelmed . Huh , well , I suppose you were surprised . Yeah . After -- Yeah , right now , -- the reputation that , you know they have quite an , uh , uh , notable reputation as far as , you know , They picked up a lot of bad press lately . Yeah , they 're banned from , in some areas I understand . Well , yeah . Uh-huh . But , any , any , any pet 's going to , can , can be bad if you train it to be that way . You know , that , they must have just targeted that breed and said , boy , we 're going , Well , yeah , it 's , when , in my hometown , they just outlawed ferrets -- Oh , okay . -- because they had one incident of a ferret , uh , attacking a k- , a child -- Oh , okay . -- in a house . Uh-huh . I mean , these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret . The , the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild -- Uh-huh . -- and , you know , they should expect something like that to happen . And so bas- , now it 's like ferrets are outlawed in the town . Oh , did it attack the child , then ? Yeah , it , it bit him . Uh-huh . And that was , that was not a good thing , but I think it was probably a , an individual ferret thing , because it was f- , it was a fairly wild ferret . Well , the -- Had n't , they had n't , -- the people that owned him should have been on the -- Yeah , I mean -- -- lookout for that . -- they really should have , should have expected it . And taken the precautions . They did n't . Sure , yeah . It 's too bad it happened , though . Yeah , because then the , the animal 's in trouble , and not the person . Right .
