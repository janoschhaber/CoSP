Okay . Your family have reunions on a regular basis ? Probably , once every five years . Once every five years ? Uh-huh . Yeah . Uh , you have got a pretty big family . Yeah and that is the hardest part about getting the fam- , the stuff together and everyone is spread out all over Timbuktu . Oh , yeah . And you ? Yeah , we have a pretty big family , but most of us , 

well , uh , uh , I am originally from West Virginia . Uh-huh . Most of the family is right in the West Virginia , uh , uh , what they call Tri-State area , uh , northern West Virginia , eastern Ohio , southwestern Pennsylvania . Yeah . Most everybody is right in that area . That makes it a lot easier . A lot more convenient . 

That is why we only do it once every five or ten years . Yeah . Spec- , because it is always that hard to get everyone together . Yeah . They put one together for our family about once every June . It was on my grandmother 's birthday , but she is , she is gone now . Yeah , see that is kind of what happened with ours . That is why we have not had one in a long time . Yeah . Uh . So , so , to make one successful , I mean , I mean what do you all do . Oh , Do you all just start planning real far ahead of time ? Pardon . Uh , do you all start planning real far ahead of time ? Well , no . There is kind of a set pattern to it . There is , uh , so , uh , the day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually . Oh , really . Yeah . Uh , we , uh , get together , at the , uh , the park , uh , the , uh , the park , and playground area of the Church I was raised in -- Yeah . -- and , uh , everybody brings lots of food and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat . Eat a lot . Oh , gosh . 

It is a lot harder for us because we are like I said we are spread out -- Yeah . -- and so we have to plan anywhere from six , well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone , can uh , start their , uh , vacation time . Schedule vacation time and yeah . We usu- , uh , Sat , uh , Sunday afternoon -- Uh-huh . -- or , uh , sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon . Usually , it is like Sunday afternoon 

and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops -- Yeah . -- to get there and back . Yeah , is that one of your , uh , I mean , uh , Well , where I am calling from is southern Mississippi . So , we have got , uh , uh , my wife and I have , uh , a bit longer ways to go than most . But , you also manage to make them . uh , actually , we , we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago . Yeah . One of the family reunions . But we are both in school 

so that makes it kind of tough . Yeah . They usually , uh , they have been happening , uh , just after the summer semester starts . You ca n't really get away . Usually not . We managed to get to one . That was before I started school and she took that summer off . But , uh , Well , now that we have been talking about it , I , uh , I am kind of getting home sick now . Because it has been over three years since I have been home -- Oh goodness . -- to see my grandparents . Well , my , my grandfather is the only one that is still around . Yeah . And see , my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically . Yeah . So , unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together , it is kind of like . She was like the glue , so . Yeah , I understand . Where is home for you ? Originally , uh , I , uh , was born in Missouri . Yeah . But , uh , you know , we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana , Mississippi , uh , here in Texas -- Yeah . -- but it is harder for everyone to get in , get home . Yeah . Well , maybe this year you can find a more central location . Well , but the majority of them are in , like , just like how you said in close , close quarters . So it is easier for us few stragglers to go home . Oh , okay . Then the majority of them are still in the Missouri area . Yeah . Okay . You know our family right now , uh , the most of it , there is only a few stragglers , uh , with any distance . There is one cousin out in Colorado , uh , uh , some cousins over in Phoenix , uh , I got a sister over in , in , uh , Washington State . Uh , the rest of them are within , you know , a couple hours drive . Well , uh , how do you all communicate ? Like to plan it and every thing . Do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we are going to do it , or do you all like mail out stuff ? That is pretty much it . Yeah . It is going to be such and such , uh , weekend and , uh , you all come . Yeah . That is about it . And you know this is the standard pattern . It , uh , everybody brings their favorite dish and , somebody brings the volleyball net , somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon and , Well , uh , uh , I guess probably the last one I went to I met so many people that I had not seen in probably ten , over ten years . It was like , do n't you remember me . And I am like no . Am I related to you ? Yeah . I know . Yeah , I married your cousin 's brother 's uncle or something like that . Do you , I mean , is that since , I mean do you have them every year ? Uh , yeah , every year . MUMBLEx . And , uh , still , you wind up meeting people you , uh , you never knew you were related to . Let alone -- Yeah . -- And , Well , I think that is probably why our is probably so interesting is cause we do n't have them that often -- Oh , yeah . -- and then when we do , and everyone finally does get together , it is like after the , you know ,
