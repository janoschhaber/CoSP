I guess , um , I 'm going to school while I 'm working at T I , so there 's not a whole a lot of time that I 've got , uh , for hobbies it seems like lately . But one of the things that I do when I 've got some spare time is I do some woodworking . And that , oh , I guess , ranges anywhere from , uh , carpentry work to , um , um , some types of furniture and , um , oh , I do n't know what you would call them , knickknacks , I guess , stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on 

and I made some , um , candle sconces that you hang on the ... Yeah , I have quite a few of those that my uncle made . There 's something about working with wood that , that I enjoy , that , I do n't know if it 's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood but , As you know , I think it 's more like the mess you make , is n't it ? 

You do n't have to worry about cleaning it up . Yeah , because it 's , it 's out there . You know I do n't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust , and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that , but then , I get the opportunity to vacuum , so I guess I get some of both . What are some of your things you like to do ? Well , when I have time I do like to sew , um , I had been doing a lot of crocheting . I make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them . Yeah . My mother was real heavy into crafts , and I would help her with whatever she happened to be doing , and then , she would go to these , uh , arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework . Oh , yeah . So , a lot of times I 'd help her with that . I have n't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately we 've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going . Yeah , it 's a good time for gardening . Oh , yeah , it 's been beautiful this last week 

but , I could do with a little less wind , but I think the , the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside . Yeah . Do you find you do most of your , your , uh , crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time ? I usually start in the fall . Yeah . And my husband says I do it , you know , make afghans so I can keep my lap warm . Well , that 's kind of what my wife says . She enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she 's always got something to cover her , her legs and feet with while she is working on it . Yeah . I know it seems like , she , I think she made three this year one for , uh , my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters . 

So , those things they take some time to make . Yeah , I found one that 's real easy , it 's , it 's , um , um , um , shoot , I ca n't even remember the name of it now , but you make it in strips . And it 's real easy to do , and it 's just that it does n't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that 

but it 's , Well , that 's kind of like quilting . Yeah , yeah . I think tha- , -- Mile a Minute . That 's the name of it . -- Mile a Minute . Mile a Minute . Well , I 'm not sure what she does I , I , first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across , you know , back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of , of afghan . 

I guess that is your standard knitting , is n't it ? Yeah , yeah . Usually single crochet would , is , is always starts it off . Yeah , I know , If we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other , do n't worry about it . We have a , a very small phone company down here . Oh , okay . And my husband says that 's called rinky-dink . Instead of call waiting or call anything else . No , no . We ca n't have that down here . We get disconnected all the time . Well , I guess that 's , that 's one way to end a conversation . Yeah , well , it gets a little aggravating . I 've got kids all over the United States and , and , you know , sometimes they get disconnected when I 'm talking to them . Yeah . What , have you started your garden yet ? Yes . We planted , um , potatoes and onions and bell peppers . Um , boy . Uh , what else did I get in there , and jalapeno peppers . Oh , yeah , always got to have those . Yeah . I think I had four , uh , jalapeno plants last year . I think one of them died , but I , I 've got , s- , I 've put them , I chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because I , there is no way that I can eat all of those nobody else in the family likes them , but always got to the keep those planted . Yeah , oh , my husband does n't like them either , but I can always give them away . Well , that 's kind of the way I am , um . Besides they 're fun to grow . I planted , uh , zucchini last year . Uh , I planted four hills of them . I think I had three or four seeds in each one of them , and those things just flat took over . Um , it was n't until late , I guess in the summer , maybe it was because it was too dry , they finally started making zucchini , and I 'm not sure when a good time to plant those is , if they should be planted early or later . It seems like all I got was , Supposedly after the soil warms up . I would think so , um , seems like these all , they all went to , uh , to leaf , and it was n't until late in the summer they started making fruit . So , I do n't know if I , Mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon . Uh-huh . You know , but I do n't , I had n't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is . I , I doubt if zucchini is in there . It may not be , it may not be . Probably the same time the , the other squash is though . You think they 're later in the year ? Yeah . Uh . About the same time that you plant okra because it 's supposed to be warm . Well , that 's true . Most of the okra that is growing around higher is , is , uh , later okra . Yeah . Well that 's about , um , We decided this year , Go ahead . I 'm sorry , go ahead . Well , I was just going to say , it 's a little over six or seven minutes . So whenever you feel comfortable about concluding , well , I 'm , that would be fine . Oh , just any time . Well , all right . I guess we 'll call this one quits an , and thanks for participating . All right . Well , I 've enjoyed talking to you . All right , have a good time . Okay . Bye . Bye .
