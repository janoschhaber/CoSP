It 's , it 's hard topic because is , is , is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like I do . Yeah , and are you talking about public schools being lower level , high school level or -- Well , public school all the way up -- -- state school . -- kindergarten all the way up to , uh , uh , high school . Okay , 

but you 're excluding high-level education . Yes , well , yeah I am . Oh , Okay . A- , actually I think that , I , higher level education , I do n't think there 's so much of a problem there . It 's pretty much funded well . There are small colleges that I 'm sure are struggling but , uh , it 's the job that the , the high school and the grade schools are doing that I see , in a area like ours , our school , even a bad school is a good school up here , where , if I lived in New York City or Washington , D C , uh , I would seriously consider moving if I had a child . I would n't let them go to a public school system there . But , of course , people are trapped economically 

and they ca n't do that . Yeah . I know down here the schools are , you know , I do n't know , they rate , I moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio and the schools down here rate , you know , bottom ten percent across the country and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why . Because they 're so far behind and so poorly staffed , half the time the teachers do n't know what 's going on . Well , that 's really too bad because it , it 's giving some people unfair advantage . 

I mean we , our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida -- Right . -- what we learned . Well , that was my experience going through junior high up there when I came down south for high school I was just repeating what I 'd already done . Yeah . Because we were so far advanced . And , uh , you know , I 'd been in a parochial school before junior high and , you know , even the public schools are behind the parochial schools . Yeah . So , you know , I , I like the concept they 've got now where they have more directed education , you know , you , you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier 

and then you , you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over . Like they have that down there that , Well , they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more , like in I live in a big Metroplex and some of the , the better parts of the Metroplex , the , the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools . 

But , uh , you know , Yeah , it 's like if , if your father owns a grocery store and you 're really interested in that , there 's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some -- Right . -- general business courses in high school . Or if you 're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art . You know , there 's no point in , you know , I 'm an engineering student and if I have to go take art classes , you know , I 'm not going to use them . 

And through high school I could have gone so much further if I 'd gone to a school that was directed . Yeah , that 's true . I was fortunate . I 'm a , I 'm a technician and we had a vocational , uh , electronics in our high school . Right , in high school . 

So when I went to my first year of tech school , I had a very easy time because our high school -- Right . -- had a , a good program . I think the schools today , you know , the public schools are just , they 're just overrun , you know , they do n't know what to do , there 's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many of the kids do n't care . Yeah , I find that -- And , 

-- that the , that in the , in the cities , it 's more like the kids go there so socialize -- Right . -- not really to learn and the parents send them there because they 're supposed to , and plus it gets them out of their hair . And I also find that , that you can send a kid to school , but if do n't work with them as a parent , I think you 're putting your child at a big disadvantage . Yeah , and , you know , there 's some kids that , you know , want to go learn , but most of them just want to go play . Yeah , well I could , I could see if a kid does n't have any encouragement if , t- , they 're , you know , come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about trying to work and , or maybe they 're unemployed and they 're mad at the world , I can see where that would n't be very good for a , a kid , you know , he 's coming up , will you help me with my homework and they 're , no , get away from me , I 've had a terrible day . 

So , it 's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from . Yeah , that 's true . I 'm wondering with the boom down here . It 's , well , not at the moment , but a lot of the industry 's moving southward . Yeah , are they going to move to , uh -- So , -- Mexico ? Uh , I do n't know about that , 

but a lot of the industry up in , uh , you know , the northern states is moving south -- Uh-huh . -- and I 'm wondering if that 's going to have any effect , you know , on what you see now . We 're , we 're , we 're behind down here . On the , I say we because I live here . If that might not turn around in the next , you know , fifteen , twenty years . Yeah , maybe the , maybe they 'll bring their good schools with them . You know , 

if the industry comes -- Yeah . -- hopefully they 'll promote good schools . Because I know the town that I come from the , the , uh , the large I B M plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one 

and plus for , for the type of student that 's going to that school , it 's going to raise the level of the school -- Right . -- because your parents are engineers or chemists . They 're , they 're , you 're most likely to do better in school . 

They 're going to help you . You hope . Yeah , you hope . Well , I think , I , I do n't know . I just think it , it 's , it 's a duty of the parent to do that . I mean , jeez , my parents always helped me and , I do n't know , it 's just like you say , it 's the way you 're raised and the economic situation you 're in . I can see some lady , she 's twenty-one years old and she 's got four kids . A kid in , her first grader , I do n't see where she 's going to have much time for them . So , I do n't know . 

It 's just like , I guess you just have to wonder , is it up to the , is it , you know , who , who 's supposed to make the change , the , the state , the govern- , the federal government , you know , where 's the money supposed to come from . Is it , you know -- I do n't know . Actually , I think it 's , I think it should be -- 

-- what , what do you advocate , more taxes or better management of what they got ? -- a civic level , the city level and a , a system level really to find out , and t- , to see what they need and not overinflate it , 

like , if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back , and you 're getting -- Yeah . -- raises every eighteen months you got to go now , hey , wait a minute , we 're in a recession here . We , uh , our town did n't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many , many years just because people are , are in the recession and they 're , even though we 've , uh , enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years , now we got eight percent , uh , unemployment when it used to be four or five . 

People are going , whoa . Yeah . So , Starts hitting closer to home . Yeah , but I always , see it 's all , it 's all money . This , like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime . It , it 's , it 's all money based . And what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and , and then if you 're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school . Who knows , bu- , maybe we do , we need some more Catholic schools , support the church instead . They seem to have done a , the good job in the past . In , uh , some places , uh , you could n't go to a public school . It was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school so , Yeah , they 're a lot more strict . Yeah I do n't , You , uh , have to learn , you are n't given the chance to , you know , screw off all the time . Yeah , I do n't know if I would do that to my child , though . But , so , pretty much , though , see , I do n't have any good ideas or , or anything that would contribute . See , this is n't a subject that I think a lot about because I 'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont , it seems to do a really good job . Well , I know I 'm in the , you know , the only reason I asked about secondary schools or , you know , advanced education is because down here , you know , going to the University of Texas , the education I 'm getting I think is kind of shoddy for a public school . Is it ? I , I do n't think I 'm getting what I should , but , you know , in Texas , it 's next to free because th- , they pay so much of it . It 's state supported . Well that , But at the same time it 's really not , it 's not like going to M I T . My engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of M I T . And that 's , it 's really too bad -- Well , -- but that 's , I do n't know , I think it just builds on the foundation that they 've already built . You get people out of high schools and col- , junior colleges that do n't have the background for an M I T kind of curriculum . So , So you have to go to a lesser engineering school . We have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot . It 's a very good school . It 's , it 's University of Vermont . Uh , we also have some two year college . Well , there 's a four year colleges . They all have a pretty good reputation . 

But , like you say , you ,
