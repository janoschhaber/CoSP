One way or another we 're now recording . Okay . Um , um , oh , yeah . Home repair . You were helping your parents . Right . I still am really . They 're , uh , sort of remodeling a house out in downtown Atlanta , in Candler Park . Uh-huh . And , uh , we 've done lots to it . We 've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them . And , So you 're remodeling ? Uh-huh . Okay . How about you ? Well , I , I just live in a , I live in an apartment now . I , uh , two summers ago I went to Massachusetts -- Uh-huh . -- and I went with a friend of mine and we undertook a building house . Uh-huh . And this was a , a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions and it 's preconstructed you might say . Uh-huh . And we started in , uh , we , started from an empty lot with , uh , 

trees and stuff on it and we had to cut them , uh , down and clear the lot . We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement . Wow . Pour the basement and , uh , went from the ground up . Our -- Wow . -- one of our main problems was , well in Massachusetts , I thought I was going to , well , it was a , a fun time but -- Uh-huh . -- I thought , gosh , summer time , you know . Well , all it ever did was rain and thunder storms . And one thing is that we 're , we had , we were going to pour the basement foundation . Uh-huh . And we 're in the process and it started pouring down rain . Huh . And I guess we had most of it done but the end was result , what happened was that some of the , the wa- , a lot of water settled on the top and it really did n't give a very good finish and some of the , it was sort of sandy and -- Uh-huh . -- and not , uh , a very good finish . Uh-huh . 

But it turned , it was okay and it 's only the basement floor so it was okay . Yeah . 

But , uh , it kept us pretty busy . It was only , uh , there was , well me and my friend and then we just had like two helpers and -- Uh-huh . -- uh , sort of a , a family type , it was n't , you know , like a commercial project or something . It was sort of just , you know , uh , gets your , get his , you know , my bro- , my brother and well , maybe , you know , my cousin 's coming over today to help us do that -- Uh-huh . -- kind of thing . So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes . Wow . And , and then materials coming in -- Uh-huh . -- and so we 're , we 're hopping around pretty good . But overall , yeah , we got it done and it 's a three bedroom , two bath house and it 's pretty neat . Nice . Yeah . So . Nice . 

So , uh , I mean what was it for ? You just , Well , it was , uh , for my friend 's parents . They had some property there and they 'd lived in this , this old , it 's sort of like a farm , you might say . And they live in this old house -- Uh-huh . -- for something like thirty years or something . And his mom just wanted a , a new house . Uh-huh . You know , that has been her dream . And so , we did that . And , uh , she was really pleased with it . So it came -- 

That 's great . -- really great so . Wow . So what , why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot . Huh ? Where you live it gets very hot ? Yeah , it does . And that 's why you , an- , and the windows have you , what type of windows are you putting in ? Huh . Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in , uh , you know , the solar game ? Right . Have you , what , what , are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or , No . We just , we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass . My parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it . Oh , okay . Okay . And , uh , but it , see in a lot of the windows ? Uh-huh . Uh , it 's , the house is eighty years old and it 's had several owners and stuff and , uh -- Okay . -- they have put plastic , Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows . Oh , these so you have the sash windows in ? Uh-huh . Did t- , uh , did it go up and down ? Uh-huh . Oh , I see . Yeah . And so , uh , and , and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there . Uh-huh . So . Yes , there 's a problem with those . Those are , uh , they usually most of the time do n't open very well . Yeah . Ours did n't . Uh-huh . And the ones that would open , uh , would n't want to stay open . They wanted -- Uh-huh . -- to slam shut . Uh-huh . 

And they also , there , they , they , a lot of vibration and it causes the glass to crack and it 's -- Uh-huh . -- a never ending problem . Uh-huh . Yeah . So . So I have n't , uh , I have n't been in any really home repair things lately . I ,
