How would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home ? Well , I do n't feel very good about it , but I think that at some times it can be the right thing to do . We sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore . Uh-huh . 

He actually died a few months after that , and so as , at least in retrospect , it was the right thing to do because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital -- Right . -- or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days . And what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him ? 

Um , well , the , see , uh , well , we , he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list -- Oh , my . -- right , we wound up just choosing a , another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into . Or but naturally , no , it was even Mennonite related , I 'm sorry , it was actually not a particularly great nursing home . 

Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it , Yeah , because he suddenly got sick -- so the convenience , -- and needed to be put in . Right . Uh , what do you think ? My grandmother lived with us , um , until August , um , and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home . She has leukemia -- Uh-huh . -- and her , the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton , and were several thousand miles away -- Yeah . -- so I made the decision to put her in a nursing home , and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility . She had her own little room and did n't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and T V set -- Yeah -- -- so . -- yeah , that 's important -- Yes . -- I would say . And that , the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days , and would have to be hospitalized a day or two , so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room -- Okay . -- so she did n't have to be transported back and forth . So , she 's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well . It 's not her favorite place to be in . She 'd much rather be here with me . But -- Yeah . -- when it got to the point I was spending more time at the hospital with her , and I 've got little children here who needed me here -- -- she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day . Right , and -- So . -- that becomes difficult then . She was falling down and hemorrhaging 

and , you know , all kinds of physical problems , so it just became too much for me to handle , even though I would have liked to have had her stay , with her health being what it was she could n't -- Uh-huh . -- anymore . Yep , we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life , but he was essentially too proud and too independent -- Yeah . -- so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad -- Uh-huh . -- he lived in his own house as long as he could -- Yeah . -- but he was living alone , had an upstairs apartment , could barely make it up the steps -- Oh . -- to the top without a great deal of pain , and this , eventually things just went too far -- Yeah . -- and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home . Yes , well , I think sometimes when people get to be a certain age , other people have to kind of help them make decisions . It sure would n't have been Granny 's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home , but she 's accepted it real well now -- Right -- -- so . -- well that 's , yeah , that 's right that the children have some responsibility , too , to their parents and such , to help decide what 's the right thing . Well , we enjoyed -- And . -- having her here , but we feel she 's much safer where she is now . She still continues to fall , but when she does there , a nurse is right there to help her -- Uh-huh . -- and I know she 's eating the right things , and her doctor 's right there where he can come in and check on her , so . It became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair -- Yep . -- so , I think she 'll adjust ,
