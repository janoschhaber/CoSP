Okay , I guess tonight 's subject is , uh , woodworking . What -- Do you , uh , 

-- kind of woodworking do you do ? Well , k- , kind of , mainly the woodworking I 've done lately is , uh , made like , uh , for example a little nativity scene . Uh-huh . Uh , not the , uh , the whole figurines and so forth , but mainly the stable , put some shelves in and , and some odd stuff around the house and so I , I enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking and I do it out of hobby more than , uh , you know , something I have to do . How about yourself ? Uh , well , I like to think of it as a hobby , but I , I guess also , partly out of necessity . Just repairing things around the house .  Uh , a few years ago , uh , we needed , uh , they needed some book shelves and I kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves and , uh , it actually worked pretty well and over the years I 've , I 've refined those plans . I got myself a router and I 'm , I 'm very good at making book shelves . Uh-huh . It 's , it 's also a way of relieving stress . My wife kind of laughs ,  at me that anytime I get stressed out I just go out in the garage and we 've got more book shelves . Well , I 'll have to come and see them . That sounds like a good idea . I , you know , and that 's , that is right , 

it is out of necessity because lot of the things that , uh , well , we ca n't be able to afford , but also I , I sometimes think that , uh , I enjoy doing that and I like to get out and , and , uh , to work with my hands and , uh , sounds like you got some real nice tools , too . Do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools ? Uh , well , yeah , I mean , little by little , I , I started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things . Uh-huh . Uh , gotten a , a good belt sander and , and , the router , uh , helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router . 

Uh-huh . The latest project that I 've been working on and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months is a , a cabinet to , to put a T V in . Oh , a entertainment type center ? Right . Oh . And it , that 's works well because you can design it to , to suit whatever equipment you have so I -- Right . -- designed a space just the right size for the T V and then the , the V C R and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment . Right , right . And , uh , that 's worked pretty well . Uh , with , uh , with the router you can make nice , uh , I guess dado joints is what it 's called . Right , or yes , I , yeah , I 'm -- Uh , -- aware of that . And it 's , uh , And also with a router , you can , uh , make ornamental facings , too better than a just straight wood edge . That 's right . And , That 's right . Uh , 

So , And , uh , casings and so forth that are , that are real nice , so that 's , that 's good . That 's good . But what I need next is a good table saw . Yeah . And I , I debate whether it 's better to get a , uh , just a straight table saw or to get one of these , uh , rotary arm saws . Oh . Radial arm saw is , I guess , what they 're called . Uh-huh . Uh , it t- , seems to me the radial arm saw is , is better , well , it , it takes up less room . Yeah . I mean , you , you set the wood down and you move the saw . Yeah . Whereas if you 're ripping wood , you 're probably better off with a , a table saw . Well and with a radial arm saw , if you do have a , a big piece of wood that you need to rip , like you say , or cut , you would n't be able to do that . Uh , but , uh , yeah , a table saw does take a lot of time , excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment . Yeah . And , Uh , that , that 's partly my problem now . I do n't have room for this . I , uh , I , where , uh , where we lived before up north , uh -- Uh-huh . -- basements were , were common and ,  I used to put all the stuff in my basement , 

but -- Uh-huh . -- not so here in Texas . No , they do n't have basements . Well , I 'm from up north also and , and , uh , no there 's no t- , basements down here and it 's kind of , uh , hard to get , uh , shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room -- Yeah . -- for that . Yeah , lot of the equipment , too , that I 've , I 've used in the past , uh , I w- , you know , I 've used in school and , uh , I would , I do n't know , I 'd , I 'd kind of like to , to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say , a table saw and some of those things that would make , uh , some pretty nice , uh , pieces of , uh , well , wood , for , for different things for tables , for , for , uh , chairs , for , you know , decks and so forth so , Uh-huh . I do n't know , I , I just enjoy woodworking and I think the , the main thing is , like you say , it 's a , it 's a good out . It 's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day and it 's a great stress , stress reliever . Have you ever used a lathe ? Yes , I have , in school I have and I 've made , uh , uh , different things , uh , la- , uh , tables for chairs and I 've made , uh , bowls , and , uh , and , uh ,
