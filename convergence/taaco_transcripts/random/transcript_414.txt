For N I S T , the National Institute of Standards and Technology . Oh , okay , so it 's right up your alley , then . I suppose so . Let me push the button . All right . 

Okay , uh , I guess I 'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system , but , uh , I sense that it 's not going to happen anytime soon . Yeah , I do n't think it 's going to happen either , but I wish it were because I 'm a , I got my bachelor 's in mechanical engineering . Uh-huh . I 'm at grad school now in acoustics and all we do is metric stuff . You 're now in what ? Acoustics . Acoustics , uh . Yeah , 

so everything 's metric and then you go to read some order book or something and it 's all confusing so I do n't understand as much , so I think we should get one adopted permanently . Well , I guess that is the policy , but it 's been the policy for a long time and nothing ever happens . Uh , I suppose things , some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that 's happening , having a new generation come up that 's more used to it . Yeah , a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to . They have to for international trade . Yeah . But , I g , guess it 's , it 's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be , uh , be- , be- , because of , of , uh , of computers coming into everything . Uh-huh . Yeah , I do n't think switching back and forth is that big a deal . 

I think people need to understand more like what a meter is , instead of how many feet in a meter or something . Just get used to using all the terms . Because someone says a kilogram , no one knows what that is . Everyone wants a , wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a , as , as , as , as a concept to hold in mind . Yeah . Uh , I , I , I do n't see that , it , it , it can change it very quickly . I mean we 're not the kind of society that , that , uh , that something can be posed upon , uh , by government will . Yeah , no one seems to be adopting it . Metric system , no one 's very , uh , no one wants it at all seems like . Uh , the , the , the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems , uh , money , dollar , coins , anything like that . Yeah . And , and , and it , it obviously makes no sense that we 're practically alone in the world in , in using the old system . Yeah , I , it 's pretty tough when you get everything confused , though . I think two systems is worse than one , though . Because , I know , we do a lot of problems and things and they 're half english and half metric and you , you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems . MUMBLEx just get one . I prefer metric , but even if it 's english , they should just have one . Well , I mean , unfortunate- , I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day . Yeah , yeah , I think so . Your , your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination . Uh , I mean , there are things you could do . Uh , we have signs up on the N I S T campus here , speed limit twenty-five miles per hour , forty kilometers per hour . Yeah . Uh , but that has n't been adopted very widely . Yeah , they have some of those in Ohio . There 's this one sign 's kind of funny . It says , uh , metric signs next hundred miles . But , I mean , and no one will , will go a step further to remove the english signs . Yeah , that would force everybody to use it . Or to quit selling tape measures in inches . Uh , yeah , 

or , you have highway signs saying speed limit , uh , eighty , eighty-five , whatever would be the appropriate number . Yeah , I guess a hundred is sixty-two . Hundred car is going sixty-two , yeah , so it would be more like , uh , like ninety I guess , car is going fifty-five . Uh , you suddenly have a have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now . Yeah , you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety . Do , do , do you know , where you are , do the schools emphasize the metric system ? Yeah , in the engineering they all do pretty much . No , I , I , I meant , I meant down , like , in the elementary schools . Oh , in the elementary schools . I do n't know . I would n't think so . I remember -- I mean , I think , -- a ways back we did like conversions , but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system . Yeah , I mean , I think my children learned the metric system , but it does n't get , get emphasized over the other . Yeah , they learn how many centimeters are in an inch and that 's about it .
