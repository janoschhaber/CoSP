So , what do you think about it ? Well , I found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said , well , if there is a problem , Right . what should we do about it ? Yeah , I guess that 's so . Do you feel there 's a problem with immigration in America ? Um , uh , I think there 's some problems , but they 're not really big ones . I think that , um , in general the whole immigration policy is n't quite as open as it should be . That it 's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if they 're educated and will be a good asset to America . It 's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that . Okay . That 's interesting . I was , I was wondering what your response would be . I 'm a first generation American . Okay . So I 'm , Uh , where did you come from ? from immigrant parents . Okay . Or an immigrant mother anyway . Okay , so where did your parents come from ? Uh , Poland . Okay . And , And that was , you know , prior to World War Two . Uh-huh . But it 's interesting that , you know , with the topic I think I agree with you . Yeah . There needs to be more of an open policy . Uh-huh . And you know we have to remember the Chinese came here and were our labor , you know , for the railroad , Transatlantic Railroad and , Yep . our Irish came and , you know , built the towns and , Uh-huh . did labor . But what do you think , are you from Texas or , I 'm from Pennsylvania . Pennsylvania . Okay . Yeah . Well , that will be interesting . Right , and , uh , Because we have just , a lot of , had a Naturalization Act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas , I 'm from Texas -- Uh-huh . -- and have become citizens now . Yeah . What do you think about that ? Um , I think that 's all right . I , um , at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing . Do you have an opinion about it ? Well , I agree with it wholeheartedly . Uh-huh . The only thing is I 've got to share with you , my background is from New Jersey . Uh-huh . So , when you were giving your answer I was thinking , is this a Texan I 'm talking to ? . No , okay . Because Texan philosophy is a little different . Right . Well , a lot of the experience that I have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who 's Chinese and immigrated from China . And , um , you know he , um , got a green card is , and is in good standing in America and China , but only because he was always MUMBLEx nice to the Chinese government , 

Uh-huh . and all that , and he was always on pretty good terms with them . Yeah , 

well we , But , um , their , my sister just had a baby and they 're trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing . And it 's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem . It 's just very difficult to get a woman who does n't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here . Oh , well , then you have first in the experience on immigration . Yeah . Well , that is interesting . Uh-huh . Yeah . Well , I wonder , you know , even with those that were involved with Tienamen 's Square . Right . 

You know , did we really protect them ? Yeah , that 's , and I think that 's pretty crazy , Yeah . because I mean those students who were in America when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back , and aside for that , they 're the best and brightest of China so it 's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can . That is true . That is true . Well , what do you think about , Yeah . we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population -- 

Uh-huh . -- that has been brought in . Yeah . What do you think about that ? Um , And these are not the brightest . See , these are refujees , you mean ? I mean we -- Okay . -- we 're talking boat people . Right , 

okay . We have a lot of boat people in Texas . Right . Well , um , I do n't have any problem with that . Um , You 're a true liberal heart-to-heart . Good for you . Yeah , I guess so . I was ready for a fight on this one . Uh-huh . Right . No , I agree because , Uh-huh . um , interesting , my , when my daughter was in high school , one of the custodians was Vietnamese -- Yeah . -- and with his limited English they found out , thr- , you know , that , she was in student council , and they found out that he was a medical doctor ,
