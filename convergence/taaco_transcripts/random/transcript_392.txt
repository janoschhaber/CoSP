Okay . So what do you guys having up there ? I have n't been up there since , oh , Lord , forty-eight , I guess . Forty-eight . That 's a long time . Uh . Well , no , it was n't forty-eight , it was , it was , uh , let 's see , yeah , it was forty-eight . I was in the Air Force . Uh-huh . We did an air show out at , uh , out at , uh , Boone Greene , no out at , uh -- Andrews ? -- Andrews , yeah . So what 's it been like up there ? Well , for the past week or two it 's been cold and wet -- Uh-huh . -- but before that , for most of the year , it 's been hot and dry . Yeah . Uh , like September was hot and dry , October . Um , September really was , 

I 'm not sure about October . I think for about twelve months through September the , the average temperature has been higher than normal -- Really ? -- each month . Huh . Um , lots of ninety degree days during the summer . It really has been strange here this year , I mean , this whole ye- , course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one . Uh-huh . But , uh , we had , uh , you know , all these , we have all these , uh , somebody said , you know , you 're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict Texas weather , but . Uh-huh . Well , always , they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever , and we had all this rain , and it really is not a bad summer at all , really cool . But all of a sudden , in , in , uh , in October , uh , September , October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time . And , uh , then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping , just pouring down , you know . There were flash floods everywhere , that kind of deal , and then -- Uh-huh . -- uh , into of November , the first , like the second week , uh , you know , the first week actually , we had , we had a freeze , and the average , you know , the average , uh , first frost is like the fifteenth of November here -- Oh , if you had it early . -- but usually it 's not until later . It 's really strange . Yeah , I think we usually have a frost in October . Yeah . Uh , but , you know . We really need the rain that we 've been getting , and it has not today , but the last few days it 's been , been pouring most of the day . Is it , is it , is it flooding anywhere ? Flooding anywhere . I have not heard of it , any problems of it flooding anywhere , I mean , that 's occurred certainly at times in the past , but , uh , no , I 've not heard of any particular problems this time . It 's just kind of , uh , clou , we 're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here , uh , which will be , you know , a little bit more typical , uh , autumn weather . But really it 's strange . We have n't really had an autumn . It 's like we went into winter -- Yes . 

-- you know , the poor trees , said what , Yes , yeah , we had MUMBLEx summer lasting long and then it , then it , then it became winter like , uh -- Yeah , uh , it 's , -- today it 's , today it 's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day . Yeah , there , you , you know , usually there 's , uh , I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas , and you know , all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine , you know , it 's that same trees , pines and , and hard woods , you know -- Yeah . -- hickories and oaks and stuff , and , uh , I was up there last weekend , and there are trees that , that still have their leaves on , and they 're green , but they 're dead . You know , the , the freeze just got them . MUMBLEx . They , they were n't ready for it at all apparently , and , and we have n't had a typical fall at all . Not much color , you know , changes have occurred at all . Really weird this year . I 'm not sure what that , what that means . I do n't know . Yeah , our leaves are , are all on , on the ground now . I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors . So you , you all actually had some color , huh ? Oh , yeah , yeah . It kind of crept in and , Yeah , 

we , we did , for a time . Yeah , it 's usually beautiful up there is n't it ? Uh-huh . Gorgeous . That 's , you know , 

I think you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the , and the pines and what not , and you could , you know , you could be driving along in East Texas and looks just the same . It 's almost , you know , identical kind of country . Uh-huh . Beautiful . Been that this year -- Yeah . -- for the trees -- Oh . -- for the leaves . Yeah , I was up , I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend , 

so . 

Um . Little , little oak tree that was dead , and cut it up and split it MUMBLEx . Yeah , that 's because it , it ca n't tolerate a freeze this early . Is that right ? Well . If it would came later it would be all right ? Uh , it , there 's some trees like the oaks , like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy . There 's , nothing bothers them . Their leaves are still green , and some of the other oaks . There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves . Um , what I notice mostly is the red maples , that the leaves are just dead , the dogwoods still look , still look , you know , they got , uh , bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit , but they still look pretty good . Um . It just depends on the , on the , uh , on the tree .
