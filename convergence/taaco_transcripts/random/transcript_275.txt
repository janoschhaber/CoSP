Okay . Okay , where have you all been on vacation recently ? Recently , my most recent trip was last year , and that was Detroit . Detroit ? Yeah . Is that a nice vacation spot ? Well , it was n't really . It was , um , uh , to see an old relative . Right , okay . And it was , uh , just to , uh , have some fellowship with her . Right . So you probably would n't recommend that as a big tourist spot ? 

No . The only thing that I , I visited that , you know , is quite a tourist spot is Cancun , Mexico . Ooh , that would be nice . And that was real nice . Uh , Did you scuba dive there ? No , we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there . Ooh , that would be nice . Yeah , and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit , Oh , that would be enjoyable . from our daily routine . Right , yeah , that 's , Huh . a nice break . I have n't been on vacation in a while either . 

Um , usually when we go , we go to Colorado , to Estes Park area . Uh-huh . Which is up kind of near Denver . Yes . And , uh , stay in the mountains up there , do a little hiking and resting , get away from the Texas heat , that kind of thing . Oh , that 's always refreshing to get away from . So it 's a lot of fun . I worked up there last summer , so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the , Oh , well , that 's nice . whole summer long . Yeah . Worked at a camp there , and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains . So that 's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation . Well , my , uh , my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity , and that 's canoeing . Oh . And , uh , they 've been to the Guadalupe River , and they also , uh , uh , have been to , uh , I guess Colorado , and they 've really enjoyed it . That 's nice . We , um , It 's a whole new , we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River . Uh-huh . And that 's the best place that I 've ever canoed . Huh . It 's really , really pretty . I was a little kid then , and we to have , uh , we stayed at some park and they had a little uh , mountain man who came down the river every night , and he would give a little talk about mountain things . 

You know , I think he was n't a real mountain man , 

but we were pretty convinced he was a full , Sure . hermit who lived up in , Uh-huh . the woods , that he 'd come in his little log boat down the river , and we would have to , we 'd MUMBLEx and he 'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he 'd found and , Oh , that 's neat . That 's a good family place to go , Sure . and then the river was really nice because it was n't too frightening , but it was n't , Uh-huh . you know , too easy either . It was like , 

Well , you learn a lot of , um , skills too , and I think you 're more receptive when you 're younger than when you 're older , to learn new skills , That 's true . and I think they really it really pen , penetrates in your memory , you know , what to do , because you really have a great interest in it . Uh-huh . Because it 's something you were n't forced to do , Right . so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning . Yeah . And you 're more receptive . Well , that 's good . Well , we , um , let 's see , the only other place I 've ever vacationed , we 'd , you know , go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that . Uh-huh . And then I went to England -- Oh , that 's exciting . -- a few years ago . I was a , Uh-huh . student there and spent , um , a semester studying abroad in London . Uh-huh . And that was a great time , because it 's so , that 's such a neat place and it 's , there 's not a language barrier so you do n't , I mean , there there 's a little bit , because there 's some of those English words that you just do n't exactly know what they mean , and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents , but it 's , it was really fun . I , I , I really enjoyed that . I 'm probably going back there to work , Uh-huh . for a year . Well , I had a friend that , uh , visited England not , well , I think it 's been probably two years now , but that 's her next goal , and she can do it , is go back to England , because she really has a great desire to do that , because the love that she , um , has for it now after visiting it . It , it 's really nice . I would , I would spend all my time in London , Uh-huh . or most of my time , and that 's it was really different being in a big city , because I do n't get much into urban , you know , really urban areas a lot -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- and it was , it 's really , it 's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone , which I thought I would just hate , but it ended up being kind of nice because you 're not accountable to anyone . Uh-huh , uh-huh . You could just kind of , Do your own thing . kind of walk around and observe , Yeah . I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people . Uh-huh . And I had a great time doing that . It was really interesting . That 's wonderful . There 's a lot out there to see , Yeah , I know , I 'll say . I keep wanting to get up to , I have n't , I have n't been anywhere else outside the United States . I have n't been to Mexico or Canada or , Well , I lived across the street almost from Canada . Oh . So that was , that , that 's a nice place . Canada is very nice . Yeah , that would be nice . I had a friend from there . Uh-huh . Then I , I 'd love to go somewhere in Asia , but I 'd have to have a tour guide with me to -- Oh , yes , absolutely . -- help with all the language and all that . Sure , somebody that knows their way around . So , yeah , that 's why , that 's why England was nice . Even , we traveled in Europe for about a week , and that was even nice because there was n't , uh , the , most the places we went , we went to Germany and Switzerland and , Well , you 've been quite a few places there . Yeah , we have . We MUMBLEx . 

Once you think about it , huh . 

We did , we whirlwinded through , Uh-huh . Europe . It was just insane twelve days where we 'd just stop like a city a day , and you slept on the train at night . Oh , that 's great . But there was n't a , it was strange , it was kind of sad , there was n't ever a language problem there , because everyone in Germany knew English and everyone in Switzerland , 

Uh-huh . knew English . That 's great . So we were kind of pitiful . 

We found one restaurant we were in and got seated , and then no one knew English in there , and we were just , Uh-huh . finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things . But it was , What did you wind up with ? . Oh , I had fondue . That was easy to say . Oh , okay . Tried to get fondue and white wine , and that was , Uh , uh-huh . we were able to have that pretty , pretty effortlessly . There were some people at the next table who spoke English , so we , They kind of guided you . elicited their aid for a while and , Uh-huh . they were very helpful so , Well , good . It was , it was a pleasant time . I 'd , I 'd love to go back there . There 's just not time . There 's not enough time to go see everything , and then to afford to see everything . I guess that 's why we need to plan for retirement , so when we do have the free time , we 'll have the , the means to , uh , pursue our dreams . Right . That 's , Yeah . I guess that 's what retirement is all about .   That and sleeping late . Yes . I keep hoping for . Uh-huh . Well -- I understand that . 

-- it was nice talking with you . Well , it was nice talking with you too , Craig . And have a good afternoon . You do the same . Okay . Thank you . Good-bye . Bye-bye .
