pretty good , pretty good . So we 're talking about drug testing in the work place , huh . Drug testing in the work place . Um . I 've been tested a few times , just before pre- , drug employment . But that 's about it . I 've never had random drug testing . Yeah , we have random drug testing at , in my business , but I 've never been , uh , never had to do it . Oh , really ? Yeah , yeah , they started that about a year ago , and I think it 's mostly for the , the field people that , you know , drive trucks and heavy machinery , that kind of stuff . Uh-huh . 

But , uh , they , they have done some testing around our office , mostly after lunch , looking for people drinking , uh , drinking beer and stuff at lunch time , at least that 's . Oh , they do with alcohol . 

Pardon ? They do it with alcohol ? Yeah , 

yeah , they , they , they 'll check for alcohol . Oh , I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine . No , once , once you start doing that stuff , you sort of , you 're sort of stuck into , uh , checking for the whole , the whole thing . Huh . That 's interesting . Yeah , it 's a , What type of field of work are you in ? I 'm in the oil business . Oh , in the oil business . Yeah . Okay , and you work in the office around . Yeah , I work in the office , so , uh , it 's pretty , pretty safe environment . Uh-huh . Yeah see , I work in the automotive air bag industry , where we make the safety bags -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- for the cars , and we work around a lot of explosives . Well , that sounds like kind of an important job to be , uh , straight on . Yeah , so that 's , you know , I 'm all for it , because the , well , the type of environment I work in , you know , they 're working with explosives , and so they could blow up the whole , well , they have safety features with each of the explosives they use , but still , it can be dangerous . Yeah , yeah , well , I , I , I agree . I think that , uh , you know , under certain circumstances , especially when you 're working in , in high risk , uh , uh , industries , where you can really hurt other people , that , that you need to have that kind of stuff . Yeah . You know , if it 's , as long as it 's not abused , uh , you know , random , you know , as long as it 's random , and , and the individual 's rights are , uh , are protected , I do n't have that big a problem with it . Now do they fire them , or do they ? Well , see , this is it , this is where I start having my problems with my company . I work for a private company , and -- Uh-huh . -- and the policy is something like , see if I can re- , state this correctly now . If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem , then you 're eligible for company counseling . Uh-huh . But if they catch you , if you test positive for a , a controlled substance , then you get fired . Oh , wow . So , it , you know , it 's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos . Huh , that 's . I think our policy is that , all right , it 's probably the same thing . I 'm not really sure what the , Yeah , really , it 's one of those things that you read once , and then , if you , if you 're not worried about it , you just forget about it . 

That 's right . But I know , they do have counseling , and that they do give you a second chance , but I 'm not sure if -- Yeah . -- if it 's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in . Yeah , yeah , our company 's a little tougher on the second chance . I mean , if , if they 're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in , then they ought to , you know , go out of the way , I think , a little bit more to , uh , to help you get , help get you rehabilitated to , you know , to get get back at your job . Uh-huh . But , uh , when you 're not , when you 're a private company , the rules do n't always apply . Uh , do you think it works very good with that random , do you think it limits , Well , it 's , it 's hard for me to , to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment 

and , you know , it 's not , I guess I ha , have n't run into anybody that 's , that 's had a problem that 's , that 's been a problem . Uh-huh . Uh , so I gue , you know , I guess it works , uh , much like , uh , well , shoot , like any lottery , I mean , everybody 's got an equal chance to get picked . Uh-huh . So , uh , I 'd rather have that than , you know , say well , this week the A -s and B -s are going to be in and next week , C -s and D -s are going to come in . You could time it just right . Yeah , right , right . I know one employee , I know , when I was working with , he had alcohol on his breath , and I 'm not sure if our policy covers that or not . That 'd be just as dangerous . Yeah . Well , especially around , uh , you know , equipment , machinery and stuff . Huh . That 's true . You know , I 've , I 've gone out and had a , had a beer at lunch time , but not to excess in any case . Uh-huh . Do they give any limits on alcohol , or is it ? Uh , I do n't remember , to tell you the truth . I do n't think they do . Um , well , they must , I mean , gee whiz . That just shows you how much I 've been paying attention , because I , I really do n't know . I 'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask . Oh . Well , you know , you can take some of that , that testing a little bit too far . Uh , there was a company in Houston that , they did , uh , an unannounced drug sweep of the , of their company -- Uh-huh . -- oh , it was , it was , it was an unannounced sweep of , of , it was not only drugs ,
