Think about , uh , taxes . Well , I think they 're a necessary evil . Uh , I wish the government would operate on the same premise that , uh , businesses operate on and that is , uh -- You spend what you have and , -- you , you do n't spend more than you , than you bring in . Yeah , I think that , the general idea is to s , you know , spend , uh , during a time of recession that , you know , for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy , but they 're running under the assump- , you know , the way they 're running it now , they 're h- , you know , running it under a deficit spending , you know , while we 're not under a recession , so there 's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we 're running , 

so that 's kind of a basic thing of economics , I guess , keep spending , keep going into debt , you 're not going to payoff what you owe , but , so , I guess the , the question was more like , uh , do you get what you pay f- , you know , get what you pay for . Well , I , it just depends . Uh , uh , roads are very expensive , uh , commodity and so is , uh , utilities they supply and police and fire department , uh , you know , they need to make a living . Yeah . There 's , So , I think for , for , for many years , uh , we 've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are , uh , to a great extent , public servants -- Uh-huh . -- uh , we have not paid them really what they 're worth in what they contribute to society . I agree with that . But , uh , then again , uh , it 's the , hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of , of , uh , government , including municipalities as well as state and federal governments . I guess , I 'm , I 'm a student right now and I do n't make a whole lot of money and , so , I , I kind of do n't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to , I guess , uh , compared to what I get , because I , you know , all my , my education is state sponsored . I go to a state sponsored school and , uh , my education all up through high school and stuff , so I guess I 'm kind of in debt , I , I suppose , because I do n't , you know , been paying taxes all that , all that long . My parents , I guess , h- , h- , however , have contributed to that , you know , for the education side of it and everything , but , uh , I usually end up getting money back . I will this year anyway from a , Uh , you 're very fortunate . Yeah , I am . 

I need it , too , otherwise , We just try not to pay any more in than we have to , uh , we pay in a substantial amount . Uh , Uh-huh . We do n't regret paying taxes . We do think that , uh , sometimes , uh , we have a reverse of a regressive tax , a progressive tax . Uh-huh . And progressive tax , I think , uh , does not give people incentive to make more money , and what I mean by that , the more income you make , the more tax you pay . More taxes you pay . It should be , I think , a flat percentage and , uh , that percentage ought to be an equitable amount . Uh-huh . Is n't , Uh , last year when they passed the tax laws for the , uh , nineteen ninety , ninety-one , whatever , nineteen ninety-one -- Uh-huh . 

-- uh , I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and -- Uh-huh . -- everything else , and I totaled them all up and basically , uh , we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax . Wow . Now , that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every , for every item on there -- Uh-huh . -- even though there 's , uh , taxes on different things . Well is n't , But , you know , there 's f- , there 's a lot of taxes you pay that you 're not even aware of that you 're paying , uh , like when you buy a tire , you pay a federal excise tax . Uh-huh , there 's a lot , yeah , lot of hidden taxes . You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your , your -- Uh-huh . -- tank . The taxes that people do n't think about that , yeah , the , the , the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay , I guess . But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes . Uh-huh . There was that , which can- , was it Jerry Brown , one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the , the tax codes they have now and implementing a f , I think a flat percentage , something like that . Yeah , if you impl , implemented a flat percentage , it would encourage people , uh , to make more money and the , what people need to understand in my opinion , now this is just my opinion , okay , uh , is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes . Uh-huh . And , so , if they penalize businesses , business people are smart enough to say , here 's my break point , I 'm not going to work any harder -- Right . -- and make any more or create any more jobs . Exactly . 

That 's , because -- And so , -- until , like eight , Based on that , who do you think you 're talking to , you 're talking to an employer . Up until , like , eighty-five or something was the ,
