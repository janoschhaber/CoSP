They tell you what our topic was ? I think golf , is n't it ? Right . How much of a golfer are you ? Are you a hacker ? You bet . I 'm fifty years old , I 've been a hacker , I think , I think I played better golf when I was fifteen , John , than -- I know I , -- I play right now . Oh , I know I did , I know I did . And , uh , Course , I know I watch my thirteen year old play now , you know , and it 's like they do n't have a muscle in their body . Oh , I know , it 's just unreal . I , you know , I 'm a guy that plays , if I play a lot of golf , I play six to eight times a year and that 's about it . I figure that 's my retirement game . I really , 

I come from a family of golfers . Uh-huh . I mean , I was raised by a man , my stepfather who , with a two handicap , I mean , he , he , he , he could get down on his knees and hit the ball , I mean , further than most people could hit it . Sure . And my mother who is now , he 's , my stepfather is dead , but my mother who is now seventy-one , I can remember her being , I believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap , but , but , uh , all they did every day in their life was to play golf every , they 'd leave work and go to a golf course , or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond , Virginia and just , uh , play nine holes of golf . Yeah . 

That was their deal , 

they , That 's what it takes , you , you need to play that often -- But , uh -- -- to get a really good handicap . -- I just , I just never could do it . I have a brother-in-law who is , uh , an ex-college coach and like a pro and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family . Well , I went to , I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more and I , I went after it and did , and I really did n't find much improvement . Fact , ever time I 'd start trying to correct something , it seemed like the score would -- Oh , really ? -- go , go back up , yeah , I , I -- Yeah . -- think I need to , uh , I probably need to take some , some more lessons , uh , more current -- Yeah . -- and , uh , and practice more often . Spend more time on the , I think I 'm probably the same way . Lessons do help . I know ever year we buy , I go to this Ducks Unlimited dinner , it 's a hunter 's type affair -- Uh-huh . -- and I buy in , in Austin , Texas , I go down to Austin , I live in the Dallas area , but I go down to Austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine -- Uh-huh . -- and we always buy this weekend at a , at a country club in the hill country . Oh , yeah . You know , at , uh , Horseshoe Bay . Oh , yeah , I 'm familiar with it . And we just have a ball , and we play three days in a row , three different courses 

and , course , believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the , uh , third course , my score has gone from , you know , a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five . So , Oh , yeah , if you play regular , I think it makes a big difference . You bet , so it , that makes a lot of difference to me . Yeah , yeah , I , well , I 've also found , too , I , I try to work out regularly and when I am doing that , uh , and feeling loose and , that I swing better , I , I , I get through the ball better . Uh , and I also , if I , I found as I 've gotten a little older here , I worry less about my distance . You bet . And I , my control is a little bit better there . Yeah . Uh , so , 

That 's super . I have n't learned to hit the ball easy and I just sort of , I 'm always wanting to hit it hard and , that 's something my stepfather never could teach me , you know , just to relax and hit the ball , and , you know , so , subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve , fourteen holes , my , you know , a lot of my energy 's gone , when I do swing it 's an easier swing -- Uh-huh . -- and I do , actually , hit the ball better . Uh-huh . Have you ever , have you ever tried a one iron ? No , I have a two through , you know , two through wedge . I hit a two iron awful lot . Off , now , off the tee . Uh-huh . I do n't hit a driver off the tee . That , that 's why I need my driving lessons . Well , you know , I put mine back in my bag this year , too , and I , I used a three wood rather than a driver . That helps . Uh , I had a lot more control on it , uh , I sacrificed distance , but I was n't in trouble every time I got down the fairway . Well , that 's , that 's a good idea . I think this next year , I 'm going to , I 'm going to attempt to play more and I 'm going to do the same thing . I , I laid off my woods about three years ago and I just use a two wood off the fairway and I 'm a fairly strong person so I get a pretty good little drive -- Uh-huh . -- and I , and I guess control my irons , better , you know , if you 'll take lessons , the first thing they put in your hand is an iron . Oh , yeah , absolutely . And , uh , I still remember that watching myself and my son so , but I think the key is you just need to , you need to play more often than I play . Yeah , well , I , I read recently here , they say , if you 're playing , if you 're scoring well , you should play more . If you 're scoring poorly , you should spend more time on the practice g- , -- Right . -- uh , range . Uh , I think there is less flus- , frustration factor there , too , uh , Makes good , makes good sense . 

So , but I , I , the one iron is something I 've been thinking because my driver 's gone so badly lately that I , I should pick one up and try to start . Apparently they 're very difficult to play with , but with practice , I would imagine you could groove that swing , too . And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron , it 's incredible . Oh , yeah . And , but , and his accuracy is what 's so startling with it . And I , and it , but it 's an iron that he 's really practiced with . He has used a lot , and , uh , it would be fun to get that good at a -- You bet . -- with an iron . Uh , distance iron . My cha- , my challenge of the game is just , if I can get off the first tee when everyone 's standing around watching you , I 'd be , great after that . That , boy , I just , if I get off the tee box and I , and I 've , you know , you know , anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight , I just want to get down and kiss the ground , you know . And get away without embarrassing yourself , right . Because ,
