tell me what you think about the Vietnam war . Okay . Well , I 'm a Vietnam era veteran , and , uh , I was , uh , fortunate not to have to serve in the theater , however , my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation . Uh , I 'm of the old school that believes that , uh , the , uh , uh , contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored . However , uh , I think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker . Uh , but those are my personal thoughts , and I think that if we 'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we 'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people . But as it was , the politicians ran the , the Korean conflict and ultimately the Vietnam thing , and we managed to come out , uh , losers all the way around . And so this is what trigger- , ultimately triggered us , uh , United States , uh , per se , being , uh , deciding to get out of the role of world policeman . Your views , Uh , as I understand it , and I , uh , do n't know a lot about it , uh , we got in there because of France -- Well . -- uh , France was there first . They had , We got into it because of SEATO agreement , back just right after World War Two that , uh , we pledged a mutual , uh , uh , defense of , of the South Vietnamese , and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another , and really we I , I question us , you know , now , of course hindsight is all too clear . Sure . Uh , so , we 're , we , we have to , have to deal with , with the , uh , situation as , as we played it . Jerry , what did you think of people like , uh , Jane Fonda , another war an- , anti-war activist . I , do n't get me started on those people . You know , before she , before Jane Fonda did , did what she did , I thought she was a wonderful person , but after , uh , uh , well , 

I , I just do n't have anything , want anything to do with her any more , because you support , uh , you support your government . Right or wrong ? Uh , okay , right or wrong , I do n't think is , is , we can determine whether we were right or wrong , because , you 're , you 're having to deal with , again , uh , I think we could have made a different agreement -- Uh-huh . -- back in for- , the for- , the late forties era that would have kept MUMBLEx of there . Uh , you know , I , I did n't realize that we 'd signed some type of deal like that . I thought we came in as first advisors to the French , and then they decided to pull out and , Can you hold just a second , Terry ? Sure . One moment please . 

Sure . Wonder what happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something . Huh , fascinating . Well that 's not , Sorry for the delay . That 's okay . Uh , yeah , this is , the , uh , the , the , uh , mutual defense thing was , uh , we , we , it was complicated , and I do n't think everybody knows the whole situation . I do n't . But from what I can gather , is we went and said yeah , we will help the South Vietnamese , uh , should they ask . Well , the French went in and tried their old style warfare , and , uh , got soundly thrashed . And we did n't do a whole lot better . Um . No , I had thought that they had , uh , colonies there , or something . Well , yeah , that was the old French colony , but see , the French , the French were our , uh , allies in NATO -- Right . -- and they 're also our allies in SEATO , which was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization , which has since been , uh , disbanded as far as I know , you know , NATO is , is on the way of being disbanded . Uh , but , uh , the , you know , the French , yeah we go in as an ally to the French and says yeah , we 'll , we 'll help you out , if you get in a bind . Well , they got in a bind and says we do n't want to , you know , play any more -- Uh-huh . -- so , uh , we , we kind of , we kind of got , got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly organi- , uh , um , oh , operations and then the full scale , you know , full scale troops , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . Yeah , I 'm thirty-two , so , uh , I bar- , well , I missed it . Seventy-four is when they quit sending troops . Uh , yeah , yeah roughly . Yeah . 

I was just probably three or four years ,
