Okay . The topic is to discuss the , uh , sources where I receive news . Uh-huh . And , uh , for me that 's mostly newspaper and radio , I almost never watch television , as a matter of course so , I do n't get news from television , except during the war , Uh-huh . I watched a lot of C N N because it was so good . Well , why was C N N the only , of course I think , Saddam Hussein only allowed C N N to broadcast it , is that not true ? Um . It was unusual not to have the different sources , you know , of news coverage . Yeah . Um , I do n't know . I guess , uh , I do n't even know why I watched C N N . I guess , I just wanted more news . It 's one of the few times I wanted more news than . Yeah , well , I know even if you watched A B C , N B C or the other , I mean , what 's the other one , uh , C B S . C B S . They all were , were tapped into C N N . Were they ? Uh-uh . Yeah . That 's the only thing they broadcast and like you I listened to radio on my job at work . Uh-huh . 

And all this week they have been having this , uh , a discussion about that is why , uh , why C N N was well , I listen to a Christian radio station . Uh-huh . And they were saying that C N N is definitely a world , uh , news service and , uh , they , it was , you ca n't really be sure of the quality of what you 've got , you know . Huh . Uh , we had some , uh , some people from our church went to Israel , uh , just for a , uh , tour sort of thing . Uh-huh . And I was watching on TV they , they broadcast this terrible riot supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem , Right . 

and so it really made me question as to what , how do we know , you know , uh , if the news we 're getting is any good . So , Yeah , I guess , the news just focuses on major events that probably , Yeah . do n't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made . Right , right . But , uh , I , I 'm from California and I can remember being in , uh , in these earthquakes and , I mean they were , Yeah . they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view , and it seemed , you know , from anyone else 's point of view , but they get all blown up in the news . Um , Uh-huh . Well I , I find it depressing to watch our , specially TV , you know , it 's just , uh , 

local news concentrates , on murders and things like that . I 'm from Dallas and , uh , we have a lot of bad stuff , uh , it just really gets me depressed , 

Uh-huh . even to watch it . Uh-huh . Yeah . So then , you wake up one morning and you are in war with somebody you do n't even , even know about it . Right . So . Well , what newspapers , uh , do you read in Dallas ? Uh , we have the DALLAS TIMES HERALD and the DALLAS MORNING NEWS , but I do n't , I do n't read newspapers . Do n't you ? Huh-uh . How come ? Uh-huh . I find it hard to , uh , follow from one page to another . It 's just something I have never developed , uh , an interest in . Huh . And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it 's stolen before I can get out and get it . Gosh that 's , that sounds pretty bad to me . I mean who would steal a newspaper ? You would be surprised . Huh ? 

They just come by and pick them up even if it 's just for the TV , you know t- , uh , selections of the day . I see . I do n't know . It just would n't be there whenever I tried it . Yeah . So , you 're right , who would steal a newspaper ? But , they do . Yeah . What part of California are you from ? Uh , from Los Angeles , but I live in Raleigh , North Carolina , right now , that 's where I am speaking to you from . Oh , okay . But , I grew up in L A . I work out here . Huh , you work for T I ? No , I do n't . I work for North Carolina State University . Huh . But , uh , I know some people at T I , and I have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them . Yeah . So , I 'm in the computer business . Well , I , boy , current events is not a good subject for me . 

Well . I do n't keep up with it that often . Let 's see , I 've , I 've , I 've never done this before , I mean I 've never . This is your first call ? This is my first call . Because I just got my password . Oh , really . Yeah . So I do n't know , are we suppose to , it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes , but I think we 've been talking for three minutes and nobody has interrupted . Yeah , well I , I got into a conversation last night with a lady and they interrupt at ten , I see . minutes . So if we 've done our three minutes . Uh-huh . Let 's just let the conversation end and say bye . Well , all right . Nice talking to you . Nice talking to you too . All right , bye . Bye-bye .
