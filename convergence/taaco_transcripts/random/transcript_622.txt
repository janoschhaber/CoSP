kids too ? Yeah . MUMBLEx . Oh , you laugh . How many , what ages ? . Well , twenty-seven up . Uh . And we had five . You 've been through the fun part . Oh , yeah . And how about yourself ? I have a four and a half and a three . Oh . well . So . It 's , I , I 'm sure there 's a lot of differences in the way , in the way it 's done now and then . Yeah . Well , when mine were growing up , I did some traveling and but not that extensively but I always MUMBLEx just made it a point , you know , to spend about ten minutes with each one of them . Yeah . So it was an hour , you know . Yeah . But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever , telling them stories or reading to them . What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest ? Six years . So they were all real close ? Yeah . That 's tough . That 's a lot of time . Oh , yeah . We look back and wonder how we did it . Did you both work ? Your wife too ? No , she never did . Uh , well , qualify that . MUMBLEx . She worked at home , I 'm sure . Well , yeah , yeah . But that 's , uh , 

well both my husband and I work and sometimes I feel like , you know , by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed , I have very little time each evening . Yeah . Maybe thirty minutes max . Well that 's plenty though . And well he spends a lot of time with them while I 'm cooking and then I spend time with them while , you know , he 's doing other stuff . And , and , of course , we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend . You know , there 's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it but it 's neat , it 's straight and I can live with it because -- Yeah . -- I do stuff with my kids , you know . Right . Well , you know , with kids you 're not going to have a neat house . Well , I 've accepted that too . And , you know -- That 's true . -- it , it 's tough to find time . It is . E- , espec- , especially with both of them working . Yeah . That 's true . And you just have to set the time and say , okay this is going to be it . Well , that 's true and , and we do a lot of that on the weekends , you know . We try to spend Saturdays together . Right . 

If my husband golfs , you know , he 'll do it during nap time , things like that where they 're not really missing the presence , you know . Right . And , and we do a lot of family things together . We 're , we 're kind of going the other direction this weekend . We 're planning a trip , just he and I . This is the first time we 've gone anywhere without the kids -- Well that 's good too . -- since she was born four and a half years ago . Yeah , that 's good that way too . Well , I decided that , you know , you need that once in awhile . That you , you need to plan the quality time and , and I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you do n't have to be there twenty-four hours a day . Yeah . Well , that , they say it , it , all it takes is about five , ten minutes a day . Yeah . And , you know , and as the kids got older I made them , you know , help me cut the grass and -- Sure . -- kind of made that a project too . Sure . Or whatever and , And they think that 's a family activity , you know . Oh , yeah . Yeah . That 's great fun . And , uh , well , yeah , if , My daughter 's like , Mommy can I help you with the laundry ? 

Of course , you can . Yeah . Just keep them talking that way . Absolutely . 

Yeah . But , uh , another thing we used to do is have ham- , family councils . Uh-huh . Every Sunday night . And what would you do , what ? Discuss everything that did n't agree with them . And we 'd take turns being president . Oh . And everyone would get one vote . And I always thought we 'd get outvoted five to two -- Yeah . -- but it never worked that way . So they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a -- Yeah . Well and we could bring up -- -- head that week and then , -- and we could bring up stuff too . 

Oh . And that was always good time . 

Boy , we really got to know the kids well . I imagine . And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them . Oh , yeah . In -- I , -- fact , they were all in , uh , over the weekend for Easter . Oh , that 's wonderful . See I was raised in that type of family where , you know , you do n't disobey me , you mind me but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it , you can always come back and talk to me about it . Well , we did too . Yeah . And I remember the one daughter saying , we had a , a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree -- Uh-huh . -- and she said , hey I do n't make fun , fun of your friends so why make fun of mine ? Uh well . Kind of r- , kind of hit us between the eyes . Yeah , yeah . You do n't think of it that way do you . No . But that , that was always good quality time for us . Now that 's good . I like -- And then -- -- that idea . -- never attend , but if , if they missed it , they had to abide by the rules . Whatever was voted on , huh . Yeah and boy , they , they 'd show up . Well I think that 's great . And we 'd usually take notes -- Yeah . -- and , you know , the younger kids , uh , or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another . Yeah . And , uh , but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us . And they loved it . I , I think that 's true . 

I can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment . Yeah . And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done -- Yeah . -- you know . So I do think it 's right that they 're harder on themselves , you know . Yeah . But , uh , boy , I , I feel for you and your husband . Oh , why is that ? Well , my , my , uh , two of my , uh ,
