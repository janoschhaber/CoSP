All right . Do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there ? Um , we 've got quite a few , actually . What we 're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city . The , uh , Um , we 've actually had some warnings in , uh , Raleigh -- Oh , you mean -- -- uh , on air pollution . -- for like smog and stuff ? Uh-huh , because of there so many cars , and we have a belt line alo- , around Raleigh where we 're trying to divert traffic . Huh . And , um , you know , i- , it 's still , it 's just surrounding the city , and you can actually see it . There 's a couple of , uh , tall buildings -- Uh-huh . -- in Raleigh , and , and you can actually , you know , they 're blurred , they 're even dark , and what it is is the pollution . Huh . What do you think of that , uh , the greenhouse effect that 's going on ? Well I guess that 's fluoro- , the fluorocarbons -- Yeah -- -- and , uh , -- that 's causing the hole in the ozone . Uh-huh . Yeah , that 's very serious . I mean , we can , we 're even feeling the effects of the weather from , uh , uh , the shift in the jet stream . 

Uh-huh . It , it is scary though , is n't it ? Oh yeah . I mean , uh , the last two , uh , years , our winters have been absolutely nothing . Right . I mean , maybe , one snow . Well , all right , North Carolina . That 's up there by Kentucky , is n't it ? Kentucky ? Uh-huh . Uh , North Carolina is all the way on the east coast . Okay . It 's further west than Georgia , it 's , uh , right below Virginia . Okay . Well , Kentucky 's next to Virginia , I 'm pretty sure . Well , I 'm from Kentucky , 

I should know but ,  I do n't , I 'm sorry . But Kentucky , we use to have severe , I mean , just real cold , cold winters -- Uh-huh . -- and we 'd have three and four feet of snow . Course here in Texas they do n't have snow , they do n't know what snow is . They freak out when there 's snow on the ground . Uh-huh . Originally I 'm from Texas so , I mean Amarillo . So , uh , Oh , Amarillo ? 

Uh-huh . Well that 's close to here . Yeah , real close . How long have you been in Raleigh ? Um , I 've been out of Texas about ten years . Well , how old are you ? Oh , twenty , uh , seven . I almost forgot my age . Okay . Well , we 're the same age . Oh , really ? Yeah , I forget my age all the time , so that 's okay . It 's , I think it 's just something that goes with the territory . Um . But to me , Texas , see and Kentucky , we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school . Okay ? 

Uh-huh . In Texas , I 'm serious , if it gets cold and it looks like it 's going to rain , I , I swear they close everything down . I just laugh .  I mean , I do , they get , I mean , and traffic slows down to nothing . Actually , they 've been doing the same thing here . It 's , you know , it 's kind of funny , they , um , I guess northerners are different , but even , uh , North Carolinians , they do n't know how to handle cold weather . Oh , well , no northe , I 'm from the north , that 's why I said we , in Kentucky , we , 

I do n't know , you just get used to the weather , and of course the people down in south , they don- , they 're not used to cold weather and stuff , and , uh , Uh-huh . it just , I do n't know , I just laugh every time they have a , every time they have snow ,  on the ground everything 's closed up . And you know , you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road . That 's true . But , uh , Do you all have much pollution there ? No , not really , I mean , not to see it . 

Now of course , there 's , you know , T I is here , Oscar Mayer -- Uh-huh . -- and there is a few factories , but I do n't see much pollution going on . Well , you know , what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road , Uh-huh . and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe . Well , see , they have that , um , what is it a MUMBLEx test , or something like that they call it . Uh-huh . And , uh , Well , that 's supposed to cut down on it . supposedly that 's supposed to catch it . But I 'll tell you what , and even these buses , oh lord , it real bad . These buses in Raleigh , Yeah , school buses and the -- Oh , yeah . -- commercial buses , yeah . I mean , school buses are notorious . Well , they 're burning that diesel fuel is what it is . 

Oh , yeah , yeah . And , uh , it , it gets bad . Well , you know what they 've started doing is , is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses -- Uh-huh . -- they 've started putting them up at the top , and that way it gets above , um , other cars on the road -- 

Well , that 's a good idea . -- and , uh , it really does make a difference , although it , it settles , you know , even if it 's at the top and it 's a lot of black smoke coming out , it still settles , and , and , you know , if you 're going to be jogging on the side of the road , that 's , that 's even more miserable . I would , I 'd have to go out to the country to jog . Well , uh , the , you know , pregnant women are n't supposed to walk along a highway -- No , I did n't know that . -- because of that smoke fumes . When I was pregnant with my first little boy , I had read it , because back then because I was walking back and forth , toc- , well not back and forth , I was walking home from , uh , the college I was going to -- Uh-huh . -- in Kentucky . And I was having to walk along the highway . It was just one day a week . But it was , in , I , I have no sense of smell , so I could n't smell this , but it would make me sick , 

and I 'd be real tired anyway -- Um . -- just from walking -- Uh-huh . -- along the highway . Golly , that 's , that 's bad . But , yeah , it 's , yeah , all the exhaust . Uh , well , that was four years ago , too , it 's probably a lot worse now . Oh , I 'm sure . Yeah . Well , they , um , you can really feel it , you know , in your breathing , even normal people , and if you 're older , um , I mean , you can really deplete your oxygen , 

and it 'll , you know , pass out , Uh-huh . and it 's , you know , it 's killed several people . Do you , uh , smoke ? Um , actually , I 'm a very , I just smoke one in the evening if that . So , I 'm a very , very light smoker . W- , yeah , it 's kind of l- , It was kind of funny . They were doing some , uh , ozone testing , and , uh , th- , the E P A and they were just screening some candidates , and I do n't think I 'd ever , you know , do that , but they , uh , asked me if I was a smoker , and I did n't fit into the smoker 's category , and I did n't fit into the nonsmoker 's category . Um , it was , you know , I was just one of those -- Yeah , because you do smoke one a day . -- yeah , in between people . So that kind of threw them off . Um . Uh , But they 're doing a lot of research here , uh , the E P A . For the air pollution . For ozone , and oh , yeah , all that . They 're , they 're real big into it . They 've got Research Triangle Park here , and they 're , you know , they 're just doing a lot of , uh , lot of stuff . Huh . But , they , I do n't hear much about it down here . Course , Texas , we do n't have a bunch of c- , pollution . Huh-uh . But , too , we 've got that air coming in off the coast . Oh , uh-huh . And you know it 'd blow it up north . Uh-huh . So , maybe that 's part of the reason it 's not so bad down here . Uh-huh . But , no it would seem like it would be the same way in , on the California coastline , would n't it ? Oh , gosh , I think I would hate to live in California , the smog there . Uh-huh . I mean , I ca n't believe they have warnings here , which it , it 's mainly just when it gets real , real hot . Uh-huh . But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially . Really ? W- , well that 's kind of good to know , because I thought lord , I thought I lived in a halfway decent area . 

I think they do that for most everybody . Um . I- , especially , it 's usually for the young children and the older , the old people -- Uh-huh . 

-- older old people . Well you ought to come to North Carolina . It 's a big change . It is ? Yeah .  There was no trees where I was from , in Amarillo , and here they 've got the mountains , the beach , the trees , you know , it 's -- Oh . -- they 've got streams , rivers , ponds , it 's really pretty here . Oh , well , this is pretty wooded area down here so , Is it ? l- , in a lot of parts , yeah . I know Texas is supposed to be flat , but they 've got , you know , down by the Denison Dam -- Uh-huh . -- there 's a lot of , uh , Sherman and Denison , do you know my grandparents live in Durant ? They do ? Yeah . They live close then . Yeah , real close . I go there , In Durant , Oklahoma ? Yeah . You go where ? Uh , you go to visit them ? Oh , uh-huh . 

Oh . Yeah , we used to go fishing in Lake Texoma . Yeah , well , down by Lake Texoma there 's a bunch of wooded area . This , but , but Kentucky 's beautiful . They 've got trees , and trees are supposed to , you know , purify . 

You know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff ? Huh- , huh-uh . It 's a philodendron . Oh , really ? It 's supposed to filter the air for you , in your home . Well , I 'm going to have to get some . I had one . My husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months , four months ago . Uh-huh . Do you smoke ? Yeah , I do . Do you ? Yeah , I do . Did you smoke when you , when you were pregnant ? Yeah , I did . I could n't make myself quit . Well . I did cut down a lot . I mean I can understand that , actually . I got , I , I 've got one vice and smoke is , smoking is it . Well , I do n't , I do n't drink , and I try not to cuss , and I do , I do very little , and smoking , I just , I got in the habit of it when I was about thirteen . Yeah . Well , one thing I miss is , uh , is the people from Texas , are , are , you know , I miss their morals , their values and everything . It 's , uh , Yeah , we 're down here at the Bible belt , are n't we ? 

Uh , I was n't saved until I got down here , and people down here are just , there 's so many Christians , and it 's so different from Kentucky but , Uh-huh . How 'd you get involved in this research ? Um , I worked at T I for a while , but then my brother-in-law works there , and he got me into it . Oh , I see . Huh . How 'd you get into it ? Um , I , I was taking a voice I O class and , um , and actually doing some research , and so they told me about this project . Well , it 's fun , I like talking to new people . Uh-huh . And I , half the time , well a couple of times I 've been interrupted by my little girl , I 've had to hang up and stuff . Uh-huh . But I enjoy it . I talked to people from , well , C- , what , Carolina now -- Uh-huh . -- up in , uh , Boston , and New York , well Boston is New York , is n't it ? No . Uh , no , Boston 's above . Boston , Massachusetts . Uh-huh . But I 've talked to people in New York , but I 've talked to a lot of people in Texas , because I guess , it 's because T I -s down here . Yeah , I 've talked to a lot of people in Texas . I had one call f- , actually from Charlotte , North Carolina , and Virginia , and , um , I ca n't remember where all . From up north , like you said , I think one was from Boston . With Boston , I love their accent .  I do , I love the Boston acc- , accent . I met a girl from Boston one time . My husband was in the service , so we went from Kentucky to Louisiana -- Uh-huh . 

-- down here to Texas , and his family 's -- Uh-huh . -- down here . We 're out of the service now . Oh , I bet you 're glad . Yeah , he got out of it , his unit , right after Panama . We went to Pana- , he went to Panama -- Uh-huh . -- when Noriega was doing all that . Oh , gosh . And , uh , he ...
