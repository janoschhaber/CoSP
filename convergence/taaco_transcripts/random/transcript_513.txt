Okay Karen . You- , you 're first . Okay . I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement . You know , not to get in , like in a dead end job . Uh-huh . And plus , for me , it 's , uh , I mean like medical and you know , uh , benefits and dental . Okay . They 're also important . Yeah . I guess one of the differences I see is , uh , working for a university , uh , there is room for advancement , but not so much so , our in , uh , quite a highly unionized environment -- Um . -- and then also in the administrative association so there is a progressive path , but not being in the say the commercial sector , the motivation is n't there for a lot of people -- Um . -- uh , like really , Are they like pretty much train for a specific job and that what I hired for and then I , just very little variation from that . Yeah , somewhat that , but then also there just is n't the ability to in one sense have , uh , a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances . Uh-huh . Uh , so that 's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution , uh , it 's a little more difficult to recognize an individual 's performance -- Uh-huh . 

-- and I suppose that 's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution , perhaps somewhat even with the business , uh . But I agree , you know , the , uh , medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the , uh , security aspect for long term employment , uh , Well , you know that 's interesting though . Because I do n't know if that 's necessarily the case anymore . I use to think that , you know , after you work , you mean security , job security ? Job security , yes . Uh , that use to be I think a couple of years ago , but I do n't know if it is so much anymore . In fact , they , we just had a lay off in what November , I guess . Uh-huh . But , uh , it was n't necessarily , I mean , you know , some people had been there a long time . Yeah , we are seeing that here as well . Like in some of the large oil companies . There has been massive lay offs . Uh-huh . Uh , so I , I think there it 's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world -- Uh-huh . -- in , uh , institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses , we need to cut back , that 's what we do . Uh-huh . No doubt -- But , -- yeah . 

Yeah , and institutionally , like here at the university , oh if there is a cut back , well gee , it 's not where it necessarily where it 's needed , it 's where it 's most expedient which , Expedient , yeah that 's exactly it . Yeah , where the most dollar , where , where you know it cuts back the most . Well , in one sense for us , it 's where it makes the least noise which means it 's -- Oh . -- often the lowest support type roles . Oh . See , yeah . So we , Yeah . I think that 's one of the things too . You get too many management people , you know . It 's very easy . Yeah and it 's very easy for them to say , oh this is the best way when they really are n't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know . Yeah . And then they wonder why it does n't get done in the same amount of time . Well , those people are n't there anymore . Right . Because it 's support people that are providing -- Yeah . -- the speed for it . Uh-huh . Yeah , but , so what else do you think is important ? Well the , uh , that 's maybe the majority of the importance , I guess . Yeah , because my perspective is from an institution , uh , the , there is not much incentive for innovativeness -- Uh-huh . -- because the limitation for reward is very severe -- Uh-huh . -- but if you 're in the corporate world , I think there is considerable motivation for I guess in- , innovation , although he , you know , the more complex your structure the , uh , less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , I think there is , uh , it 's a long term type of process where in a small organization it 's , uh , things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts . I think probably in a small , yeah , I was going to say more , it 's more personal for one thing . You probably have a better team , uh , cooperation , or team playing , atmosphere . Right . 

Probably , where as in a bigger corporation , I think you 're just a number , you know . Yeah . You end up being your own person -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up , well then that 's their problem and -- Uh-huh . -- you know you really , whereas yeah in a smaller , I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished , you know . Yeah . Yeah . It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves . Uh-huh .
