Do you have any children ? 

Yeah , I have two , two boys , twelve and sixteen . Twelve and sixteen . Uh-huh , how about you ? Well , I have three , and , uh , they 're five and three and nineteen months . Oh . So we kind of got different ball game but , uh . Right . 

What , uh , do you feel like you have any time , to spend with them ? Well . They 're probably at an age where they do n't want to spend any time with their parents . That 's true . You actually , of course , spend less time with them when they get older , but it 's , of course , still really important . Right . I have a kind of a fortunate situation , I think , right now with my sixteen year old . Um , I work two nights a week at a , I 'm a librarian -- 

Oh , uh-huh . -- and I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library . They keep it open , you know , for kids to do their work -- Right . -- and he , um , and then they , the school district hires an aide , you know , to work -- Sure . -- for me . Well , my son is my aide . Oh , well , that 's nice . So , two nights a week for four hours we 're stuck together -- You 're stuck together . -- and there 's usually not very much business . No . I mean , some nights it 's just real , real quiet . So . I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part . So we , I have sort of a captive audience , so I really do spend probably more time with him than , than most , you know . Right . But , uh , of course I 'm away from my other son those hours , too . But his dad 's at home -- And so that -- -- pretty much that time . -- kind of gives him , uh , time with his dad , then . Yeah , that 's true , yeah . Gives him a little bit of that individual time . But , but it is hard , once they get that age , I mean , their friends are the most important thing there is . Right , and they want to be able to spend , uh . That 's right . Well , I 've even noticed that with my five year old . She started kindergarten this year , and -- Uh-huh . -- every day that she 's not at school , uh , she thinks we need to have someone over and play -- Uh-huh . -- and that kind of -- Yeah , it 's kind of hard . -- yeah , it 's hard , I think , uh , I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should . Yeah . I 'm more worried about , Oh , I did n't this done , I did n't get , the kitchen needs to be cleaned -- Uh-huh . -- this needs to be done , and -- Uh-huh . -- and I need to re , remind myself to slow down and -- Right . -- it 'll still be there tomorrow . Yeah , that 's true . But that 's kind of hard to do , you know . 

Yes , it is hard to do , right , yeah . You do n't see yourself getting . Well , if you 're kind of a person that likes things , you know , organized or neat -- Uh-huh . -- or , you know -- Right . -- then I think it , it is hard . It 's , um , I think one of the nice things about holidays is that , you know , it does give you the opportunity to spend more time -- Slow down a little bit . -- yeah , with family . We have , we often go to Illinois -- Oh , uh-huh . -- for Christmas , and we 're not this year , and it 's just really nice because we can do , you know , the things you want to do . You can do , uh , more than -- Yeah . -- than when you travel . Yeah , that 's right . This is the first year we 're staying home , too , and , uh , I think it 's going to be real quiet but , uh , that 's an opportunity to get out the games and , Yeah , right . 

See , we usually do that , my , my kids even have already gotten out , um , my twelve year old got out the Legos -- Right . -- which of course he has n't touched since last summer -- Of co- , of course . -- but , you know , but every now and then , I mean , he 's got a lot of those technic , those hard kind , you know , and he wants to be an engineer , so he still likes -- Oh , yeah . 

-- all that kind of building stuff and , um , we have the train , and we have n't had that Lego train together for years , and , um , so he sat down , and I told him I really wanted him to build the train , and we would put it under the tree , and that I would keep it together , I would n't take it apart -- Would n't take it apart after that . -- yeah , and every year I 'd have the Lego train under the tree . That 'd be kind of fun . And , um , so he worked on that for the longest time , ever since school was out on Friday , and , um , then his sixteen year old brother started helping , too , you know . 

you know , these are kind of things like during the normal rat race -- Right , right . -- those kinds of things never happen -- No -- -- but . -- no . In fact in , I think if people would learn to turn off the T V -s and -- Uh-huh . Yeah . -- I think that 's a lot of the breakdown of the communication -- Yes , yeah . -- and the communication -- Which is , -- that would take place in a family , usually people are not sitting in front of that . Uh-huh , and there 's always a few people in the family that , when they stare at it , you know , they 're totally turned off to everything else . The rest of . Yes , and you ca n't communicate while you 're doing that , right ? No . That 's right . Whereas , uh , I 'm the type of person , I could not sit , well , I should n't say I could not , but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without -- Yeah , yeah , me too . -- doing something . Yeah , Because they talk so much , is n't that the , they talk about T V shows , and I , huh , you know , how can you watch that , you know -- You 're kind of like , what are you talking about and , uh , -- it 's the best show on , I do n't know . You feel like you 're a little bit out of it , do n't you . They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what 's ,
