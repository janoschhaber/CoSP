Okay , well , you , Do you have any pets ? 

Um , we got two cats . Two cats . 

Yeah , and , uh , um , yeah , we had cat , you know , my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my Mom developed an allergies , Uh-huh . so , I mean , I 'm used , I 'm used to having cats around , I like them . Yeah , I like having ca- , cats around or pets around in general I , I favor dogs over cats actually but , Oh , see , I 'm not , uh , I 'm not a dog person at all . Oh , I 'm , I 'm a dog person . I had , I guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid , right ? . Yeah , probably , 

I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid , Uh-huh . in fact , I may still be , um , we , But not cats . That , um , I wonder sometimes . Uh-huh . Um , but we , um , we house sat for a , um , my , um , my wife 's boss a couple weeks ago and , um , uh , he has a dog and everything , we were , you know , we were sitting the dog and everything and , uh , I felt like just miserable all weekend and it really did n't dawn on me until Sunday , it was like , hey , maybe you 're still allergic to the dog . It was like , oh , that could be it . 

The thing I do n't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek , Yeah . of the dogs , and constantly . Well , dogs are real high maintenances , 

you got to take them for walks and you 've got to pay a lot , you know , you need to pay attention to cats and everything but it 's not quite the same thing . Yeah , that 's true . Um , and , um , um , you know , it 's , it 's just nice that cats , you know , cats , yeah , you do n't have to let them outside , you know , all cats are indoor cats , Uh-huh . so , you know , they 're not , yo- , w- , you 're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood and , you know , they , you know , they , they make their mess in the cat pan which is , Limited . yeah , it 's , you know , it 's a pain to clean but , you know , we used to , I mean , they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats ' pans . They did n't , Oh , really ? Well , when I was , you know , when I was growing up I had a clean the cat pan all the time , and I hated it because I had to carry everything upstairs and , you know , and use this thing to , you know , scoop the , take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible . But now they have like this , you get these liners , Uh-huh . that is garbage bags , you know , and you , and you , you know the , Oh , that sounds so easy , what I did , Yeah , the cats do it in there , you pull it and take it out and throw it away , and that 's it , . Yeah , 

I housesat from cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis , Uh-huh . and what we used to do was just put , um , newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter and then I would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing . Same idea . Then I would do it , you know , everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very , very rarely , Everyday ? and so it was n't so bad . Oh , okay , I see . MUMBLEx two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling , I would put just a little bit of cat litter in there , Uh-huh . because if I put a lot , one of the cats would have been , all of her animals that she ever had were adopted . Uh-huh . I that true , yeah . Yeah , she 's even got , she 's got one dog now and the two cats and her dog there is , is basically a reject , somebody had bought him , Uh-huh . and wanted him . It was her ex boyfriend and , you know , just was not mature enough to keep the dog , did n't realize how much work it was and now , Uh-huh . she 's stuck with it . And she 's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals but I think that for me , well , my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat . because that 's all there is to it . So , you know , So , you do n't have anything right now ? No , we do n't have anything right now . 

Oh , except the kid , huh , that 's , Oh , right , , now we have a kid but he was , no , completely against having a dog or cat , 

he said , they 're much , they 're as much work as a kid , and they 're harder to get rid of for the weekend , . And , Uh , I do n't , I do n't know because the cats pretty much , um , yeah , we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out , Uh-huh . and , um , uh , it 's not a big deal really , I mean they 're , they 're happier when we 're around but , you know , they , they 're pretty much okay by themselves , um , and I do n't , you know , we could n't do that with a dog . That 's , uh , yeah , really true . But like the friends , other friends of mine have cats , they have four of them , and if they go away , they have , they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats , you know , they 're so used to the attention , that if they do n't get it , they get really upset , Well , that 's , and , you know , they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that . That 's , um , pampering the , the petals . I , I tried to have , um , , figured something having , MUMBLEx so I tried to have a goldfish , Uh-huh . and , um , I killed that one within a very short amount of time . But they 're not that much fun , you know , you ca n't take them for a walk , you ca n't , you know , they , they do n't , they ca n't fetch , you know , Right . they ca , they ca n't do anything , so I 've never , I think we had fish sh- , when I was a kid but I do n't , My brother had fish when I was a kid I remember that , and one of his fish jumped out of the , um , gosh , what do you call it , fish tank . And fried itself , , on the radiator behind the dresser . I 'll never forget that because I remember my brother , Oh . he came home and he counted the fish and one of the fish was missing and they could n't find it anyplace , they could n't figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on , , the radiator behind . Oh . MUMBLEx it was not gross , I did n't see it but , um , Oh . MUMBLEx got them . Trying to remember we had a dog for a while , and I do n't know if we got rid of the dog because my brother was allergic to it , my brother had asthma and some allergies which I think he 's outgrown now , 

Uh-huh . but because of that we did n't have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish . Uh-huh . And you , they 're , like you say , they 're not the most exciting pet to have . No , it 's like , I just , I do n't know , I , I just never understood why , what the attraction , I mean , they 're , you know , they 're pretty and everything but I 've just never s , seen the attraction of having fish . It 's not as much fun . Well , a friend of mine had , um , an eel , , an eel ? and then he had a , um , I forget what type of fish it was , it was one of these fish that i- , it would eat , it ate a big other fish and things like that . There would be sort of moby fish in a tank . Oh , now we really get sick . Yeah , and it , I , I could n't see having fish like that . Yeah . I could see some having , maybe some of the tropical fish , that are really , really pretty but , Like , I remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha , 

Uh-huh . and , uh , you know , used to drop mice in MUMBLEx 

this is not , these are n't cats , , you know , Yeah . this is gross . Yeah , no , that would be , what did they do , everyone come around and watch them . Yep . I mean , I guess that 's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house , Yeah , well , and your things destroyed the mice . But , Yeah , well , a cat will do the same trick . Let 's see , I had a pet rat , , for a while , and it was a live rat , and , um , this woman just offered it to me while I was in , in graduate school and , I had a friend in col- , she was actually a very fun pet . I had a friend in college who had a , um , had a pet rat for a while . Uh-huh . Um , I forget how she got it , but it was , um , it was the same kind of a deal I think she got it , I think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department . Yeah , mine had been a , a , a how did this work , a mill rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said , you know , this rat is acting really strange I think he 's sick , and she said , I do n't think he 's sick , I think she 's pregnant , . Whoops . And they had misclassed the sex of MUMBLEx back there and so , um , she asked me if I want to , one of those babies , and I took the baby and I got her when she was , you know , just this tiniest little thing like , Uh-huh . half the price of a mouse , and then she grew to be , you know , I had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big , Uh-huh . you know , like a pound or something I do n't know how much , and I had her for over two years and she was very affectionate . She would , you know , crawl on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while I was working , Uh-huh . and things like that . Yeah , much more than you would think . Oh , yeah , I mean , you know , if you get them young and everything before they go , kind of nuts , so . Yeah and , Yeah , rats are not my favorite animals in the world , but I could see getting one from birth and everything . 

Yeah , I , sort of weird for me to have had one too but there , it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage and , you know , it was easy . Yeah . Easy to take care of and but , Yeah , I , I , I have friends with hamsters and gerbils and they , they tell me the same thing . Uh-huh . I just , again it gets into vivant much fun , , you know what , I guess they can be . I , Actually it was more fun than you would think . Yeah , starting from the beginning but , um , yeah , we live , also live in the city now , actually in Manhattan . Okay . And so it 's almost impossible to , it 's not fair to a pet to have a pet here , Right . or certainly , certainly not a dog , I mean , people do , Oh people , but it 's not , I do n't , oh , plus , I mean , the pooper scooper one New York , so , you know . Oh , yeah , you see all these people , yeah , these stately people , and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them , it 's really kind of funny . Yeah , uh , I was living in northern Jersey when that law came through , remember hearing all about it , Uh-huh . we were wondering if they , uh , they had any special law for the horses in Central Park . Right , no , they do n't . I should make you , Of course , not . they have , um , the bags behind them but I think they 're actually supposed to , Hit the bags . MUMBLEx keep them , yeah , keep them clean but , oh , gosh , I ca n't even walk by Central Park yeah when summertime , just the smell is so bad , Oh , God , I ca n't , of the horses . Have n't been up there , last time I was there was fall so probably was n't that bad . Oh , well , it 's not that long ago . It was , Not this past fall but I mean fall , Oh , twelve times , of the year . a few years , I mean , it w- , it was in the , yeah , it was almost like October of eighty-five , Uh-huh . I think was the last time I was up , up there and at Center Park . Yeah . Um , I had a friend who went to Colombia and I used to go up and visit her . Uh-huh . Um , so , Yeah , that 's not too far from were we live , do you have , you said you had two cats , are they , um , just what you call it , are they breed cats or anything or are they just , No , they 're just mutts , Uh-huh . yeah , 

my wife got them from , uh , um , friend of hers at work and everything , you know , you know , as kittens , Uh-huh . and it was before , I mean , this was before we even met . Um , she 's had them for a couple years . And um , you know , they 're really cute , they 're , they 're sisters , Uh-huh . one of them is a lot bigger than the other one and , , she pushes the other one away from the food . Apparently w- , I do n't know all the details but they were born around Christmas because one of them is named Tinsel and the other one is named Holly . Uh-huh . You know , the scr- , They 're both females ? both , yeah , both females , Uh-huh . they 're both spayed , Uh-huh . um , or whatever it is , neutered , you know , , um , and they 're , they 're both declawed at least on the , the front claws . Uh-huh .
