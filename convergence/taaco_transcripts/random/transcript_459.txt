Okay what kind of -- Okay . -- foods would you have ? Um , well , I like to cook , um -- Oh , I do too . -- but I do n't like getting too awfully fancy about it , just -- Uh-huh . 

-- because , um , uh , it 's too much pressure . Uh-huh . You know , if I have people over for dinner , I like it to be -- Yeah , you ca n't enjoy it . -- nice and relaxed . Right . Yeah . And so I do n't like to arrive , or , or when they arrive , for me to be completely worn out . That 's , that 's what , I like doing things like making lasagna just because I can have it ready and baking -- Yeah . -- in the oven , it 's , -- Exactly . -- everybody just says how wonderful it is , and it 's -- Uh-huh . -- it 's like , uh , yes , I . Yeah . That 's one of those things I got famous for in college . People would come and say could y- , would you come over and make lasagna for me . Uh-huh . It 's like , well , I ca n't really give you a recipe , uh -- Uh-huh , 

you 'd just do it . -- I can -- MUMBLEx . -- I can just do it . I like doing that kind of stuff . Yeah . And it 's , it 's fun , in fact that 's what we had for a Christmas party last week . Uh-huh . We just had a bunch of people over and we had , we did lasagna and garlic bread and , uh , yummy . Um . Boy I like that . Uh , I do too , in fact . Yeah , well I 'm planning a , and naturally this is appropriate because I 'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and -- Oh . -- then the next night . Oh , good . So Tuesday night there 'll be eight people here altogether . Uh , actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays , just because it 's a , real easy , is just baked potato dinners . Oh , yeah , uh-huh . And have , you know , like three or four couples come over , and I 'll do the potatoes and you know , like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings , whatever they like -- Uh-huh . -- and it turns out great , because -- Yeah , that 's fun . -- I mean , you 've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and , you know , bacon and all that good stuff . Uh-huh . But it 's , it 's inexpensive -- Yeah . -- plus it 's real easy on the hostess , because you can just have the potatoes ready , and just have a salad with it , and you got a great dinner . Yeah , 

that 's a good idea . It 's , it 's real easy , I like doing that part . Yeah . I 'm in favor of very little clean up , um , very -- Uh-huh . -- little planning -- Uh-huh , yeah . -- because we 've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games , and -- Uh-huh . -- it 's , we invariably end up at my house since I 've got two kids . Uh-huh . And that , it 's , it 's fine , because then I can just say , Okay fine , you bring this , you bring this , you bring this , we 're done . Yeah . And it 's pretty cool . Yeah , that 's good . Well , one of my favorites if I do n't want to have other people bring stuff , I just want to treat them is -- Uh-huh . -- to make chicken and rice . Oh . It 's very easy to . Oh . You do n't like it ? Oh , I love it . 

Oh , you do , okay , yeah . 

I have a really easy recipe for that , where you just brown the chicken and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan , you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it -- Um . 

-- and , and you put the chicken in , then pour the , uh , broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want , and then you just . Over the uncooked rice ? Yeah , over uncooked rice -- Oh . -- and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven , and it just . Oh , how neat . It fluffs up , and it 's really moist . Huh . Now I 've done it with , where you put , you cook the ri- , well , I guess you probably could do it same way , but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup , and put a little bit of white wine in it . Uh-huh , wow , yeah . And every once in a while , I 'll put in , I 'll slice white grapes and I 'll put in there , and , that 's just because I 'm not a real big wine person but I like it , it -- Uh-huh . -- adds something to the chicken . Yeah . And then just bake it , and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice . Well , I 'll keep that one in mind . Yeah . Yeah . It 's , that was one of the first things I made for my husband , because I was like , um , yeah -- Yeah . -- I could actually find something I could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant -- Uh-huh . -- kind of . Yeah , you can get away with it -- Oh , yeah . 

-- even having a semi nice dinner , or , you know semi MUMBLEx . But then , I had n't thought about doing it with uncooked rice . Yeah . So , just , like in a thirteen by nine pan . Yeah . You put in , um -- Um . -- let 's see , what was it , three quarters of cup of rice or , Um . It depends on , you can really vary it . Uh-huh . But you have to put the water in proportionally . I ca n't remember . I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water , two cups , um , broth . Yeah , yeah , I , I use that for br- , for rice and for when I cook pasta or something , I 'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to -- Yeah , MUMBLEx flavor . -- give it a little extra flavor . 

Uh-huh . Yeah . Um . Now that would be good . Uh-huh . How long do you have to bake it ? Um , let 's see . I think it was an hour . I 've done it in the microwave so often lately because , it 's , it 's really easy . I do , I do microwave too , a lot . Yeah . But , I think it 's about an hour . How long would it be -- Or maybe it 's only half hour . -- how long would it be in the microwave ? Um , you just , until the rice looks fluffy , and -- Oh , okay . -- and not overdone . Okay . You know , before it gets overdone . Do you just brown the chicken to get it colored -- Yeah . -- or do you go ahead and let it cook through ? 

Um , I 'd let it cook just a little bit -- Um . -- just so that the cooking goes a little faster . Ooh , this is a beneficial call . I like this . Yeah , I liked your idea too , there . Yeah , but that one 's an easy one . It 's like , just put in , a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the , with the soup and the wine -- Uh-huh . -- put in garlic and onion powder -- Yeah . -- or chopped onions if you want to do that , you know . What ever , however much effort you feel like putting into it . Uh-huh . But it , it makes a great , I mean , I 've got a two year old and a four year old and they love it . Uh-huh . And , because my daughter calls it her gravy and I mean , she thinks it 's wonderful , my , good , you 're a picky eater , if I can get you to ,
