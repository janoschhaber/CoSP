Okay . So , what are your favorite shows ? Um , I like watching COLOMBO and , um , MATLOCK and -- Oh , really ? -- QUANTUM LEAP , yeah . QUANTUM LEAP ? Uh-huh . Did you see it the other night ? Um , uh-huh . 

That was , that was pretty good . Yeah , that one was . What about , What do you , with the psychic and everything ? Uh-huh , yeah . Okay . Yeah , I like , uh , I like NORTHERN EXPOSURE and , uh , HOME IMPROVEMENT . Oh , I , well I have n't seen either of those . You 've never seen NORTHERN EXPOSURE ? Huh-uh . Oh , it 's a great show . Um , I also like to watch STAR TREK , but it 's on so late here , that I do n't always get to see it . Really ? 

Yeah , we like it , too . Have you seen the movie ? Uh , I have n't seen any of the movies because I just barely , just like in the last year or so got interested in it , and they 're , you know , already out with number six by now , but . So I have n't seen any of the movies , yet , but I . Oh , you have n't seen any of them . No . Oh , well , they 're good , they 're real good . They 're , uh , they 're getting rid of the old cast for the movies , though . Uh-huh . Which ones are you watching , the new ones ? Yeah , I 've seen quite a few of the older ones . I have n't seen really the new generation that much . 

Oh , okay . Yeah . Is there one you prefer better , the older one or the youn , the newer one ? Well , they 're , they 're a lot different . But , I like , I like the older ones because at that time , you know , they were really futuristic , you know . Oh , yeah . And the newer ones are , I guess the newer ones are real futuristic , too , but I like , I like both of them . Yeah , I do too . I have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot , I mean , he almost hates the new ones . Really ? Yeah , because he , he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one is n't or something , but , I do n't . 

No . Not really . It 's not really like -- Oh , I think , -- a soap -- Yeah . -- opera , but , but it 's , but that 's true , I mean , you , you learn more about the characters and stuff , but that 's the way all shows are now . Yeah , sure . Well , let 's see . Um , I like to watch COLOMBO because it 's like a mystery thing . Yeah . That 's sort of how Matlock is , but COLOMBO is way tricky -- Yeah . -- I mean he does n't even try to let the person know he 's getting onto them . 

Well , it seems like they always -- Well , did you see the one . -- show COLOMBO , the same ones over and over , though -- Um . -- you know what I 'm saying , like that one where he goes to college , or is this , is there a series on . Um , yeah , there 's like one on , well we see it Thursdays at seven , and -- Okay . -- it was , this last time it was about this , um , movie director , did you hap- , -- Yeah , I saw that one . -- did you see that ? See , that was a rerun . Really ? Oh , I guess I nev- , Yeah , I wondered if that 's -- Huh . -- see I do n't know if that 's a , the movie of the week or , or what , but it seems like there 's only about four or five different ones , and then , then they keep showing them over and over . Oh , I guess I 've , I have n't seen it before . He was a movie director , and he had that gal killed . Yeah -- Okay . -- yeah , on the set or something . That was pretty good though . Yeah , it was . But , yeah , I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things . Uh-huh . But , um , there 's no , never anything good on Saturdays , though . No kidding . I do n't think so . Well , STAR TREK 'S on at five , but I 'm never home so , What is it that , there 's something I watch , something I watch on Saturdays , and I ca n't remember what it is . Now I used to watch TWIN PEAKS . Oh . You never saw that ? I 've heard of it a lot , I 've heard of , a lot of people somehow or something . They 'll say , so and so from TWIN PEAKS , or something , you know . 

Yeah , yeah that was a different soap opera . Oh . But , it was , it was a different type of show . Uh-huh . I did n't like the way it ended , though . Oh , did they end the whole series ? Yeah . Oh . Yeah , they did n't , they only did it for , I think , two years . Oh . But it 's all over now . Oh , another show I like to watch is MASH .
