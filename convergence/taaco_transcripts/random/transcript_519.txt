Okay . So Frank , what , uh , type of , uh , budget do you or your family have ? Well , uh I do n't know that we really have a budget . I have a set amount that I , that I save . Actually , well actually there is a , a way , budget our money apparently . The , uh , my wife , uh , has so much , uh , gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and , uh , we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff , gas , and things like that and besides that I , uh , you know , I have a set amount that I save every month . Right . That 's , uh , sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have . Uh-huh . I am single , so . Uh-huh . I guess , I do n't know if that 's an excuse for not having a tight budget , but I basically , Really do n't need to . Right , I do n't need to . I am the only that I have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier . That 's right . Uh , and also I , you know , I try to save a certain amount each month as well -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , I try to , try to have an idea of what my expenses are and I am pretty consistent from month to month -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , whenever , uh , I need to , uh , whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it . Right . Well , I found that , uh , you know , things , as I have gotten older , I am in my fifties now , but before we use to have , to have to have a very strict budget , 

I had four kids and , uh , you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for , for this and for that . Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be . Uh , I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside , uh , I kind of fence off areas of my check book . For instance , there are certain things that I know come up , uh , every so often . 

Every six months I have to pay car insurance . Uh , every six months I have to pay my taxes . So -- Uh-huh . -- I take a set amount . I 've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh , uh , saving in and I also have got a checking account besides that , but , what I do on my money market account , my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month . I will just take two hundred and twenty out and I put it in parenthesis . I take it out of the right line total -- Uh-huh . -- and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up . Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it . Then when the tax bill comes in I 've got that much set aside . Right . And I guess that 's a way of budgeting . Yeah . 

That 's , I guess I kind of do a similar thing . More , uh , medium or longer range . I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for . Like I am , probably within a year I would like to buy a new car . Uh-huh . So , I kind of have a , an amount in my mind and I am making every effort to , to sal- , put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever . Uh-huh . Yeah . Uh , cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget . Not only for buying them , but for keeping them on the road too . Right . 

Uh , you know , we 've got two cars . My wife has a car and I like to drive pick up truck . So , we are on a schedule where I try every , uh , three or four years to , to buy a new one . And you know I am constantly making car payments , but I figure that 's got to be the story of my life anyway , is making car payments . Uh-huh . So , uh , you know , I get one paid for and , uh , actually I am saving up for another one besides so -- Huh . -- it 's you know , it 's kind of a never ending thing , but -- Right . -- you try to , you try to schedule those things so that , uh , you only , you 're not paying for two of at the same time -- Right . -- I guess is what I am saying . Have you thought about , uh , leasing ? Well , uh , I have thought about it , but leasing would n't , you know , I do n't use it for my business . I see . My wife uses hers just for pleasure and I use mine just to go back and forth to work -- Right . -- which is only ten miles away so . But if you are rolling it over every three years , it might be advantageous to do that . Yeah , I guess . Uh , You know , typically , you , if you purchase your own car you tend to make , uh , the best returns after you pay it off . Uh-huh . Of course , the longer you keep it beyond that point , the more profitable it is to own it yourself . 

Right . Yeah , you 're right . Uh , I have , uh , been know to keep trucks or cars for oh , ten or twelve years , but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff in them you know . That 's right . Yeah , mine 's , uh , seven years old and I think last year was , that was a rough year for it . I had a number of expenses . Uh-huh . But , uh , I am hoping that most of them were just kind of , uh , you know the , as you get to a certain number of miles , you have to get everything replaced , brakes , shocks and all that . So , I just went through that whole set last year . Uh-huh . I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again . Those things can really upset your budget when they , when they come in . Uh , you know , it 's nice to have a little bit set aside for the , for the unexpected shall we say . Right . So that it does n't , uh , kill you all in one month . Right . What line of work are you in ?
