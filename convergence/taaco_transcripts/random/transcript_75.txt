There we go . Yeah . Well , uh , I think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than I would expect this time of year . I think that 's true . The , uh , the Bermuda grass is greening up in March , and sometimes does n't really start doing that until the first part of April . So . Yeah . So I think we 're a little hea- , ahead of schedule on that . Yeah , I was out in my yard yesterday afternoon , and I noticed all that grass coming up , and I thought , ooh , we 've got to start this mowing bit soon . That 's true . It 's been a , a fun break , but the break is over . Yeah . Well , um , oh , I guess another thing I 've noticed , too , here lately is that even though we 've had some pretty warm days , it 's been awfully gray , you know , just , Yeah , 

now , the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny . Yeah . But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it 's gray . Well , yeah , but I 'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend . Oh , I go for that , yeah . Yeah . In fact , I 'm a little worried about this one coming up here . We have a long weekend and , it sounds like it 's going to be a little bit on the cool side . 

Yeah . I have n't heard whether it 's going to rain or not . I think there 's an eighty percent chance this evening , but it 's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest will be without rain . Well , that 's good . But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties , and the lows in the forties . That 's getting back to a little bit chillier . Yeah , that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year . I think , I have n't seen the wea- , the weather on the news in the evening lately , but I think the average high would be , should be about seventy . Yeah . I 'm not certain either , but you 're probably right . Yeah . Well , I like it when it 's sort of a medium temperature , uh , maybe seventy-five to eighty , somewhere in there . I do n't like it when it 's too cool or too warm . I 'm much more apt to get things done when it 's at that sort of in between temperature . Yeah , that 's true . Um , one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high . Um . And what that tells me , is that the summer weather is very predictable , that it does n't vary very much . Yeah . You 're probably right . I mean , any other time of year , that 's not the case , because it could be very warm or very cold . 

Yes , as a matter of fact , I heard the weather the other day on T V and I think it was one day this week a year ago -- Uh-huh . -- they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather . You know -- Right . -- it was n't just a super bad storm , but it was -- Right . -- it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the , the late spring time . Yeah . One of the weirdest things I saw , I think it was around this time last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm . Oh , wow . I , you know , I was going into the grocery store , and a , a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead , and it was twenty- six degrees out . Um . And I thought , Well gee , I 've , I 've never known it to lightening at that temperature . Yeah , that , that is pretty unusual . And you really take notice of it , too . That 's right . It , uh , it probably was a lot warmer up high . Sometimes they get those inversions , like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing . The air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees . Um . The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and could n't get away . Wow . I do n't , do n't like that super cold stuff . Nope . I just do n't move very well when it 's that cold . 

Yep , I , I 'm really enjoying this now . Well , this has been interesting . Yeah , well . Not too challenging to the brain . Not , not a real in depth topic , but -- Nope . -- enjoyed talking to you . All right , Ellen , well you have a good day . Okay . Bye . Bye-bye .
