Okay . Okay , I guess we 're ready to start . Well , I guess , what part of t- , what part of the country do you live in ? I 'm in Dallas , Texas . Oh , okay . What about yourself ? Well , I 'm also in Dallas . Okay . The reason that I ask is the two conversations I 've had , have been out of state . 

Uh-huh . But , uh , have you always lived here in Dallas and , No , I 've lived here for almost five years now . I see . And I 'm a , uh , before that I was at school in Rochester , New York and I 'm originally from Boston . Oh , well , you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood . That 's right , but I like it . You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow . Well , I missed it at first , but now I go back there and I 'm a real wimp about the cold . So -- Yeah . -- I like it here . It 's nice . Well , that 's good . I , I have lived in Texas essentially all my life . 

Uh-huh . Around in Texas and , uh , I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it . Uh-huh . But , uh , I do n't know , I 'm not sure I would want to take on those winters . I 'm -- I know . -- getting older and , uh , not sure that 's something I want to do . I live , uh , over in the Lake Highlands area if you 're familiar with that . Uh , tell me where that is , uh , Okay . I , Uh , you , I probably do know , but I do n't know it by that name . 

This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia , Skillman -- Okay . -- cross . Sure . We 're just north of , uh , White Rock Lake . Oh , okay , yeah , I know that area . That 's a nice area . Well , we have some very nice hou- , homes here in this area . Uh , my particular , I guess they want us to describe the area , so , uh -- -- my particular area , the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five , eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million . Oh , that 's quite a range . Yes , uh , the homes that were here earlier were smaller . Now they 've gotten larger and larger as , as they have developed the land . And , of course , it 's pretty static right now and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy . Uh-huh , yeah . How about you ? Well , I am , uh , I 'm , gosh , I 'm barely in Dallas . I 'm just north of Addison Airport -- Okay . 

-- up on the tollway . Okay . And , I guess we have a similar situation . I mean , we 've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy , eighty thousand -- Uh-huh . -- and then we 've got Bent Tree right across the street so I do n't -- Okay . -- I do n't even know how high those go , but some of those are pretty big . Yes , those are over a million . Yeah . So , it 's , that 's the strange thing about , I guess , Dallas because back where I 'm from , you would n't have that sort of a variation at all . They 'd all be pretty similar to one another within a , a couple miles . So , Well , we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas . Yeah . Not as bad as Houston , but , exactly what you 're describing is what happens all over . Uh-huh , yeah , I 've noticed that . Well , now , do you live in a , a home , or -- 

Uh-huh . -- zero lot home , or , Uh , we 've got a house , let 's see , we moved in about four years ago and it was , it had previously been unoccupied , but it had existed for three years . Okay . This is a whole block of homes that , uh , a builder built all of them and , I guess he , he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away , type of deal . So the whole block was all foreclosed . Oh . And , so , some were vacant for quite a while before they , you know , they finally sold them because there were so many . Well , your , was your house in good shape , was it damaged ? Yes , no , the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they 'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open . Oh , it was ? But , yeah . Oh . So we just , you know , we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that . I see . And , uh , we 're really , we have n't had any problems and , you know , we had originally thought we 'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we could n't afford anything . But the prices are much lower here and this was definitely not a fix up special , but I 'll tell you , it takes all my time . Between , we put in our own sprinkler system and I just finished repainting the exterior and , you know , making drapes and buying furniture , it 's just a money pit . Really is . Yes , I am -- -- familiar with that . I , where I live is a house that 's seventeen years old when I bought it . And we bought it from someone who was in it , but before they had it , I found out after I had been in the house , it , it had sat empty for the better part of a year . Uh-huh . And I 'm not sure what happened , but I do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for , for about four years . Oh , no . I , I , I found a lot of things , 

but ,
