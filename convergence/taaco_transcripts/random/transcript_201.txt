Do you live in Plano or work in Plano , or both ? Both . Both , are you a T I -er ? Yes . Are you at work right now ? Uh-huh . 

So am I . In building , which building ? Well , are you Summit or are you , uh , I 'm , I 'm , Spring Creek ? 

I 'm Spring Creek . Oh this is fun . What building are you in ? I 'm building , uh , one . Oh , I 'm building two . At least we found something different . That 's , I 've never had a call , Not like that . Neither have I . No , is n't that funny ? I usually get some place , I got a woman in New Jersey the last time I called , I think . Right . That 's funny . That is funny . So , So how 's the build- , how 's the weather in building two ? The weather in building two is cold it 's been cold . It 's been cold in the building . Outside the building it 's not bad . Typical T I , or T I , 

listen I got me doing it . Typical Texas Spring . Are you a native to Texas ? No , no , I 'm , I 'm a transplant . From ? From California . So what do you think of the Texas weather ? Not as nice as California . How long have you been here ? Oh , five years now . Oh , okay . I 've been here long en- , pretty long . So . You , you , you know about August then . Yes , oh , I 've been through five of those . Okay , there 's no surprises left . Right , right . A lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in August , for , you know , if they 're going to go out of state for vacation -- Uh-huh . -- that 's the time to go . Good idea . Real good idea . Yeah , we went up to Wyoming this last , uh , Summer during that time . And it was like you know , eighty degrees up there . It was beautiful . Nice to get out of Texas for a while . We went to Alaska . Well , that 's , that 's the even , even farther away . That is really nice . It is so cool , you wear a jacket , you know . 

Even in the Summer time , huh . Yeah , or keep one handy . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Because it 's , it rains a lot in Alaska . Is that right ? Uh , it , they call it their liquid gold . Um . But it , you know , you get sunshine , and it 's lovely , and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice -- Green . -- and moist and very green . 

Um . And blooming . Oh my goodness , it 's pretty . Right . Well , Texas is n't bad . No , no . Not in the Spring . 

Right . I have to think every year to try to remember what it was , what 's it supposed to like this time of year . Spring is nice . Yeah . Because March we usually get a lot of rain , in March , you know . It 'll seem the news , the Harold Taft , you know , on the local news . Right . March we typically get a lot of rain , and we 've had this many inches , and , you know , we 're right on target , you know , and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March , but I -- Oh , we always -- -- it 's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like . -- we always do though . Yeah -- uh , it , -- I wish , I just wish it would n't come all at once . That 's right , and -- -- then we get all that heat . Right . Well , it 's just that , you know , when it rains , it rains . In California you get these nice , lovely rains , you know , nothing really down- , you know , like downpours like you have here . The other day we had some hail , the biggest hail I 've ever seen in Texas . Oh , really . Yeah , I live in Garland . Oh , you got into that bad stuff . Yeah . We got hail the size of marbles . I mean , just so noisy hitting the house and the glass on the windows . It did n't break anything , but we went out there afterwards and there 's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn . Is n't that strange . I know , I , 

you pick them up , you know , and they 're perfectly round . And I go , gee , how did they form , you know , so perfect like that . I think that 's one of the strange , strange things , and you very seldom see it though . Right , right . I 've seen hail , you know , but usually the size , you know , of , uh , tiny , tiny pebbles . You know , really small , you know . 

But this was , uh , really large . So it had come , it 's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently . Is that correct ? Uh , I do n't know how hail is formed -- I think , I think -- -- to tell you the truth . -- that 's , You do n't think it 's cold enough , you know to , It 's not on the ground , but -- Right , must be . -- in the clouds it is . I guess , and then , I think , you know , all that falling would warm it up and melt it , but maybe that 's what rounds it , I do n't know . But , tumbling . I was dumb . I was in , um , Florida for a week on business . Uh-huh . And I had called back to the house . I stayed the weekend , and I called back to the house . My housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs , said something to the effect of , now we 've made the national news , do n't get upset , and do n't worry , it 's in Garland where all the bad weather is . I said , Okay , you know -- Uh-huh . -- and I watched the news , and I thought , ha ha , that 's Garland , that 's not Plano , I do n't have anything to worry about . I was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me , stupid , you own property in Garland . Felt so dumb . Um . Finally I got home and found out my property was okay . Yeah . There was no problem with it . But I guess you just tend to think of , of where your house is -- Right . -- you know , and nothing else . Right , and close to that , what 's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland , that 's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there 's , there 's the hard rain . Oh , oh , I see . The creek overflows and a lot of houses , a lot of houses around that creek seem to , to get flooded -- Oh , okay . -- the streets and stuff around that area , 

The house , that house , get a lot of flooding . that I bought is close to a Firewheel golf course . 

Okay . Just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that 's going through . Right . That 's where I live , close to that . Oh really . Yeah , uh , uh , not quite , I do n't live in that Firewheel division . But I live close by there -- Is that a nice area ? -- in north , far north Garland . Yeah they 're supposed to , it 's getting built up , you know , with more new , new shopping centers and things . You know , it 's a fairly new area . Yeah and , uh , and they 're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by , by the next , by ninety-three or ninety-four or something , a brand new mall -- Well , -- not too far away from that area , so . The house that -- 

It 'd be nice . -- the house that I bought was really , really nice . Uh-huh , in the Firewheel Estates there , whatever . Yes , 

yes . Uh-huh . Really , really nice home , very pretty . Uh . 

Uh-huh . But you 're not living there right now . No , I 'm going to lease it . Oh , I see . It 's , it 's investment property . I see . But it is really , it 's a very nice place . Uh , I , I would cheerfully live there . 

Of course it 's not my home , and I 've lived in my home in , well , almost ten years , and , you know , I 've got everything just exactly like I want it . Right . But if I were to live some place else , it certainly meets my standards . It 's a nice house . Uh-huh , yeah , that 's a nice area . Is it on the golf course ? No , it 's not , it 's off the golf course , and I 'll be honest with you , I 'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is . Is that right . But it 's in the estates that adjoin it . Yeah , right , right . Well that 's a nice area . Yes , it is . That really is a nice area . When they get that highway finished , you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go -- Yeah , that one nine -- -- fairly quick . -- that one ninety is just going to be the mo- , the outer , outermost loop around . Right , another belt line , just , uh , farther out . Right , just continue to do that . Right , right , right . Where are you from in California ? Southern California . San Diego ? I 've lived in San Diego for six years when I was a ki- , younger , and L A area , and my parents live in Anaheim right now . Lived up north of Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks area , where the Cowboys have their training camp , or used to anyway . I 've been through all of that . Yeah . Uh , there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks , north of Los Angeles that is really an eerie , strange looking area -- -- with boulders , I won- , they 're not really hills , they 're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation . Huh . I 'm not familiar with what , is it along the coast or -- Uh . -- or inland . Well , you know , it may be a little bit more inland . That is one of the strangest areas I have ever seen . Um . Uh , I had to go up to T I on business -- Out there , uh-huh . -- a couple years ago -- Uh-huh . -- and we went up that coastline , and I was just amazed how unusual that looks . Huh . Here , hang on just a second , I 've got a Los Angeles map . Let me just quick . Yeah , MUMBLEx valley . Yes -- Okay , I know where that is . -- beyond Thousand Oaks . I know where MUMBLEx Valley is , I 've been out there before , sure . You do n't think that 's strange looking . I did n't notice anything strange , I guess -- Oh , okay -- -- about it . -- maybe , maybe I 'm used to Texas . Maybe Texas the way , The elevation is extremely high . Uh-huh . It 's got curving roads on it , but , but the , it 's just a strange landscape , there 's very little vegetation . Huh . I did n't , I do n't remember seeing that part of it . I know MUMBLEx Valley , yeah , it 's just a suburb of L A . Right . It 's a , And they 've built some new highways out to that area , and things , lately . People can get in and out of L A easier . Maybe it 's a place I went to , it was far extreme , thought we 'd never find the place . Huh . It was interesting . Yeah , sounds interesting . Because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up -- Right . -- through that way . Right , right . I , I know exactly MUMBLEx that area . It 's a nice area out there . I love Thousand Oaks . Uh , Texas , I do n't know , thing , things , you just have less a variety , I guess . I think , I do n't think it 's quite as green , you know . It 's green with all the trees and things out here but it 's just , Oh , it 's green sometime . Yeah , but it 's just , you know , I do n't know . Well , it does n't stay green , you know -- Right . -- the really , and in all honesty , I know this sounds like a Texas story , all honesty , you have n't seen the hottest of summers if you 've only been here five years . 

We have n't had a -- Yeah -- -- really bad one , -- I missed that one of eighty or eighty-two or eighty-one -- Oh . -- that had the heat wave . It may be eighty-two , because we bought our house in eighty-one and we built a pool in eighty-two ,
