Uh , so what do you do to exercise ? Uh , s- , I , uh , weight train , uh , three days on and one day off . Uh-huh . I , uh , ride bicycles , , uh , fifteen , twenty miles , I do n't know , maybe three times , maybe four times a week . I play basketball , uh , couple times a week . I play softball one night a week . Uh , that 's what I do . 

Um . What about yourself ? That 's pretty impressive . Uh , I guess I bicycle . Uh , the amount varies as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week . Uh-huh . Uh , I guess a play softball one night a week . And I backpack a lot over the summer . Oh , really ? Yeah , that 's , that 's about the extent of it . I mean , I do n't do any of those things particularly , you know , for exercise . But , uh , I guess the bicycling is the one thing I 'll sort of , like , do if I feel like I need to go exercise . Uh , but I do it mostly for fun . Yeah , uh , what do you ride , uh , like , a bunch of hills or pretty flat ? It , it , it varies . Uh , out near my house is pretty hilly . Uh , but sometimes I bike to work which is about , uh , a fifteen mile trip each way . And that 's mostly flat . How long does that take you to get to work ? Uh , about forty-five , fifty minutes . How d , how does that work , work out with , uh , storing your bike and showering and all that ? Yeah , it can be a pain . Uh , basically , uh , I work on a campus so I can store my bike in my office and walk across the , uh , campus to the , uh , gym , use the shower there -- Uh-huh . -- uh , but , it 's , it 's enough of a pain , that I did it consistently one year , I would commute every day , uh , but it just became such a pain . 

I mean we 're talking , you know , forty-five , fifty minutes for biking , Right . uh , and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind . And then another half an hour , you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff . It was a big hunk , hunk of the day . Uh , and then of course another hour to get back home . Uh , so I 've been doing that less , and , and concentrating more on , you know , light biking when I get home on the evening and then , you know , some more on the weekends . Yeah . 

Do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there ? Not so much . 

Uh , I guess mostly I bike on my own . I 've got a touring bike . Uh-huh . Uh , though I have n't gone on any extended trips with it . How about you , what kind of biking do you do ? Uh , well , actually my wife just got me into it and I did an , did an internship at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas , Uh-huh . the Cooper Clinic , and I learned all the health benefits of , you know , I was a solid weight trainer , Uh-huh . and all I did was weights and aerobic exercise and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it , so , Uh-huh . once I got into this , uh , internship , I learned all the physiological ad- , advan- , advantages to it , so I began a program couple , I do n't know probably three or four weeks ago and I did my first bike rally this Saturday . I did , uh , forty , forty miles , Um . and , uh , that 's the longest I 've ever ridden so far , I usually , you know , fifteen or twenty . Uh-huh . And it was , it was kind of hilly and it was pretty tough , but , uh , I 'm looking at , uh , doing a lot more of it because , you know , my wife is really into it , Oh , I see . and I , I kind of held her back a little bit this , this weekend . She wanted to go , go , go , but , Uh-huh . you know , she wanted to stay with me . It 's good to have a partner . Yeah it really is . Are you think of doing any , like , centuries , or ... 

Yeah , that would be cool sometime if I could , you know , work up to that . Uh-huh . Yeah , I just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like , you know , uh , uh , touring like from Vermont or , you know , that kind of , 

Oh . thing . I mean people seem to get into different aspects . One is more of a distance , and one 's more , just , you know , they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour . I 've never really looked into that . That , you know , that 's , my wife would just love that . Uh-huh . And I may do that sometime . There again , I 'm just kind of a fledgling into this . Uh-huh . I 've , it 's kind of funny . I called this number and I was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up . Yeah , yeah . I mean , around Texas , you , you got about five or six , if you live around the Dallas area , you got five or six every weekend to choose from . Oh , that 's nice . Because they 're really into it . Um . Bicycling is really big here . I did n't know that , and , you know , until I came down here , and , Wow . kind of caught the fever . Yeah . 

Because I lived in Indiana all my life and , you know , you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that , or above the age of fifteen or something , -- Uh-huh . -- but , other than that it 's nothing up there like it is down here . Yeah , I 'm not sure why that is . I mean , generally in the Midwest it seems to be less , much less . I mean , maybe it 's because of the winters . Probably . Uh , or maybe just because , you know , there 's , there 's a lot more flat lands , you know , out in the West . Yeah . So it makes biking a better alternative for transportation . Yeah . It , there 's a lot of bikers around here . It 's , it 's really neat . Uh-huh . 

There are a lot of , a lot of resources , a lot of magazines , and stuff , little TEXAS BICYCLIST , is like a little newspaper that comes out every month . Um . It 's free just go to the bike shock , bi- , bike shop and pick it up , and it 's got all the rides coming up , so I guess I 'm going to be busy about every Saturday this summer , Oh , that 's terrific . going to a different ride . 

Yeah , see a little bit of Texas I 've never seen before . Uh-huh . So , uh , how long have you been biking ? Oh , I guess as an adult for just about the past , uh , three years or so . Uh , you know , I guess last time I did it before that was college , which was about ten years ago . Yeah . And , uh , yeah , I guess I just never really thought about it much for a while , uh , until I suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot . And so I thought I 'd try it , too . Have you ever had a , uh , it 's kind of slightly off the subject , but you ever had a , uh , a blood workup done recently or since you 've been biking , No , I have n't , no . to see if it , because it really , from what I understand , it really improves your , uh , cholesterol -- Um . -- and , you know , it , uh , it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is , uh , uh , low cardiovascular fitness , and also , uh , you know , the cholesterol . Uh-huh . It gives you increased H D Ls and decreases your L D Ls . Oh , that 's great . Yeah , so ... Yeah , I 've , I 've definitely noticed it 's had a good effect on my pulse rate , my resting pulse . Yeah . You know , it gets it down to about forty . Really ? Yeah . That 's good . Yeah . You say you ride about a hundred , hundred fifty miles a week ? Yeah . Man . That 's , that 's hard-core . On average , yeah . When do you get to begin with the winters and all that ? What time of the year do you usually embark on your , do you ride inside if you ca n't ride outside ? No , I 'm not that hard-core . I mean there are some people , in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow . They 've got a , uh , mountain bike ,  you know , with the big knobby tires . Yeah . And , I do n't do that . I basically , I , I pretty much lay off for the winter . Uh , I was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter , you know , because it will help your balance when you 're indoor training . Um . Uh , but I just , you know , more or less stocked , like an exercise bike and that kind of thing . , uh , but , yeah , I mean winters are kind of a problem so , I 'm more or less out of shape now that I 've been biking , I guess , this year for just a couple of weeks . Uh-huh . Uh , but , you know , up here , it 's only stopped snowing since then . Yeah . Uh , , but , yeah , it 's , it 's , it 's , it 's pretty good . It 's , uh , the main , the main thing , I guess , for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like , you know , exercise and a chore , I 'll lay off it more . Right . So you , uh , change up your routes a lot , and keep a ... Oh , yeah , yeah . I try to go someplace pretty different , you know , every week . I rotate around , uh , about four different routes , uh , from my house or I 'll sometimes come in the school . It 's nice coming , it 's , it 's nice riding to school because it 's all along a canal path , uh , because it 's just , it 's along the Erie Canal up here . So , what school is it ? Uh , University of Rochester . Oh , okay . Yeah . So it 's fairly picturesque . Yeah . And , uh , so it 's , it 's , it 's a good ride as long as you 're not doing it every day , it 's a good ride . Yeah . That 's true . Sounds neat . Yeah . It 's kind of , I was wondering if I was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and does n't want to and everything else , but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week . That 's , uh , motivating . Yeah . That 's really good . Well -- Oh , it was good talking to you . -- good talking to you and keep up the good work . Okay , you , too . All right . 

Take care . Bye . Bye .
