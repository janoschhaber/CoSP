I , you know , actually in this modern day and age , it seems like , uh , uh , we have more and more leisure time because , uh , we have so many convenience , appliances and whatnot . We do n't even have to cook dinner anymore . Yes . Yeah , really . Uh , but I , uh , I 've heard , I do n't know this for a fact , but I 've heard that a lot of families really do n't spend a great deal of time together . That ki- , the kids maybe on the average get , uh , something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents . That 's what I 've heard too . Uh , It seems bizarre to me . I do n't quite understand it , although I think probably the , the worst thing that 's happening in the world , at least the modern world today , is television . Yeah . Not so much because , uh , it 's bad per se , although there is some pretty crappy programming and I thin , there 's also some , uh , I think , uh , poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time . Right . It 's so darned easy to turn the thing on . I know it . I 've , I tell myself sometimes , just sit down after work , So I refuse to have one in the house . Oh really ? 

Yeah . Well good for you . Good for you . A lot of people , I talk to a lot of people about that and I 've thought about it myself and I though about it a lot Uh-huh . But , uh , I still have n't done it yet . Well that 's good . Well I 'll tell you . Television sure makes child rearing easy on you . I mean the kids can be a real pest , uh , and turning the T V on is almost like magic , you know , it 's like sticking , uh , an electrode into their pleasure center and you do n't have to worry about them . That 's true I 've noticed that . But I do n't think it 's too good . I do n't think so either . Uh , so , you know , I do n't know , I take advantage , I do n't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids , but I take advantage of , um , dinner time . We always eat together and , you know , whenever you 're with your kids , you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them . Do you keep your kids , uh , active in sports or anything or , Uh , I guess our big outlet is music . Uh -- Oh , okay . -- our thirteen year old son plays violin and our , nine year old daughter plays cello -- Okay . -- and , uh , when our son started playing violin , I took up violin and when our daughter started playing cello , I took up cello . So there 's plenty of , plenty of interactive time in , uh , practicing . Although neither kid likes to practice . I guess that 's not a big surprise . No . Not for kids . But I mea- , I imagine with infants you are , most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them . Yeah . Well -- Although , 

-- I , I try and read to them and I take them to the park and stuff Oh , you know , reading is so good . I , uh , I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little and I still try to read to them , although our son is not liking that anymore . Yeah . Well , they get to that stage . Uh , but I read , you know 

there 's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book . Have you ever seen that yet ? Sleep book , no . Yeah , it 's called a sleep book and , uh , you ought to get it . I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized . Uh , We 've got quite a few of DOCTOR SEUSS ' books . Yeah . Well , I think , I think his sleep book is my favorite . Oh , really ? Uh-huh . Well , yeah I like to , I like to do it and they enjoy reading . I 've , actually I never read a lot growing up and I never read until a few years ago I just started picking up books and so I 've found that , you know , it 's really important to me to get to read . To , I like to get away in a book , you know ? Uh-huh , uh-huh . And so I 've put a lot more emphasis on that , on my kids -- Uh-huh . So how -- -- to try and , -- much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day ? 

Oh , I probably spend an hour or two . Oh that 's great . My wife works at night , so she does , uh , Tupperware , so she 's gone a lot at nights and so -- 

Oh , I see . -- I spend a lot of time with them . Ho , how old are your kids again ? They 're two and one . Two and one . Uh-huh . Yeah , so you have your hands full with them , that 's for sure . Yeah .
