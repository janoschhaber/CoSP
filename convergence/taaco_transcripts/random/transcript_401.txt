Yes . Um I guess my initial view is our tax burden has n't gone down in recent years despite , our total tax burden , despite tax cuts -- Uh-huh . -- but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in , in the world , and in MUMBLEx of the matter , you get what you pay for , if we 're going to have national health insurance , which seems likely , it 's necessarily going to involve more taxes . Uh , I suspect , I take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the , the economy , that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes , uh , energy taxes , particularly , and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes , that 's the direction we should look . Right . Well , I guess I kind of have mixed feelings . Um , you know , you always sit there and out of each pay check so much comes out of it , and you wonder , you know , where 's it all going -- Where 's it all going ? -- and we have such a huge , uh , national deficit , and , and I guess a lot of times there 's questions wondering well , if it 's doing a whole lot of good . I know there 's a lot of social programs out there that need help . 

But you kind of always wonder , well where 's , where 's the money going ? . Well , one , one , one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax -- Uh-huh . -- which in principle is going into , into a big trust fund , but that is a particularly regressive tax , uh , it 's a tax on the first dollar earnings , and Senator Moynihan 's , uh , proposal to , to , to cut there I think wou , makes a lot of sense . I 'm sorry , I could n't . I think Senator Moynihan 's proposal to , to cut the social security tax which is n't really going to , going to beef up , up , up the social security program could make a lot of sense . Right , right . Yeah , I agree with that . As far as other countries , I 'm not , um , I do n't keep up on it too much as to far as what , you know , as what they 're do . 

I know 

we were in Ireland last year -- Uh-huh . -- and I know that the tax there is extremely high , much higher than we pay here , but -- Oh , yeah . -- but as far as other countries , I 'm not , uh , up to par on . I think Japan , I think Japan is probably about equal to ours -- Uh-huh . -- and other major countries are higher . Our friends were amazed that the sales taxes , the cost of things when they went to Canada not so long ago . Uh-huh . And , as a whole , most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services , and -- Right . -- it 's a real , real , they 're , they 're real trade-offs there . Right . Yeah , but , and , and you sit there and wonder , um , I guess this does n't really have to do with taxes but just money in general , and , and , um , wondering if you 're going to have enough when you retire to live on . Uh , I , that 's , that 's a scary thing that there 's no , no real knowing about . Uh , the , the there 's a lot of inflation risk that is n't taken care of in most private pension plans . Uh-huh , yeah , that 's true . But , um , are you involved with the legislature up there , or which , No , I 'm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology . Uh-huh . Uh , part of the Commerce Department . Okay . Here in Gaithersburg , Maryland . Uh-huh . I was just wondering since you said Washington D C , and you , and you picked this topic , I was just -- Well , well -- -- kind of curious . -- I , I , I did n't pick it , uh -- Oh , you did n't . -- I mean , um , I , like I do n't really recall . I may have filled out on the , on the form , but I , I certainly , certainly have the feeling I 've been given topics different from the ones that I mentioned before . Oh , did you . See , I have n't placed any calls . Did they automatically assign the topic ? Yes , yes , when you place a call -- Oh , I did n't -- -- topic is given to you . -- know that . I thought whoever made the call could choose what topic , because I have n't made any calls yet . I 've just received some . Oh , you should try it . Oh , I did n't realize that . Okay . Yeah , because it 's kind of a , it can be a rather controversial subject depend on who you 're talking to . 

Uh , many of the subjects are . Uh , taxes , taxes especially . Um , one thing that has kept our tax burden high , and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the , is the level of def- , of the defense budget -- Exactly . -- and that 's , that same subject ,
