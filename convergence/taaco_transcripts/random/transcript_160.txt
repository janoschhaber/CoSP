Well , Stephanie , what 's your position on gun control ? Well , on a scale of one to ten , uh , being ten , no , kind of legislation and zero being , uh , total ban , I probably would lean more towards six or seven . Um , I feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals . Uh-huh . Um , I lived in Massachusetts for two years and they have a total ban on guns and I saw that , it did n't stop crime in that state . Now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles ? Any , any kind of firearms . Really ? Yeah . Uh , it 's , there 's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught , um , with a firearm and also I think there was a fine . And that did n't help at all ? No , I do n't , the , the crime is not any better or any worse , I mean it 's , Huh . I , I should n't say I do n't know if it was any worse , but it certainly did n't get any better . Uh-huh . I usually just , 

I 'm trying to think of , I guess I would tend myself to be more towards the , the , like three , Uh-huh . where I do n't think you should necessarily ban guns any , by any means , but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature , uh , you know , you should n't be able to go out there and just buy one and , you know , right off the shelf . Yeah , I , I , I agree with that . And but , I , I think that the , the law is on who can buy a gun are , are way too lax . Uh-huh , exactly . I think that , I think that the , 

And , so , I think that kind of control is , would be good , Yeah . but the , uh , I , you know , I 'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement and , just to kind of exam it a little bit and I , I know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true , uh , only the guns were in the hands of the criminals , but how many times , I guess I have never heard of a , a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who 's being robbed had a gun . Um , I , And maybe they just do n't report those or I 'm not sure or , you know , I ca n't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed but good thing they had their gun on them and they , they thwarted the robbery attempt . Yeah , I , I 'm , I 'm not really sure , I do n't , personally I do n't own a gun , Uh-huh . um , and I do n't think I probably ever would , um , although I would like to know how to handle one , and I think it 's good that everyb- , and I think everybody should learn how to handle one . Uh-huh . Um , you just never know when you might come into contact with one . 

True . Um , Did , did you , were you brought up in a family that hunted or , No . Uh , nobody in my family hunted , uh , my father had , had guns when I was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in Massachusetts . We lived in New Hampshire at the time . How about that . And he lived in Massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns , Huh . so we ended up , uh , with these guns , Uh-huh . 

and my , really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere . Oh , jeez . And so that was really the only experience that I 've had with guns and it , Right . it kind of scared me . Uh-huh . But I think that if I learn how to use one , I would , I would feel better . Right . I 've also always thought about the idea , you know , most sports , you know , which are the N R A and people have their thing , you know , if you ban guns , you 're just banning the , the recreation , the sport of hunting , things of that nature . Most of that 's done with rifles and such . Uh , though there 's , you know , probably I 'm sure some sector that does it with handguns . But just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns , would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous , you could n't be inconspicuous , Yeah . when you walked into a store stuff like that , you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately , you know , you- , if they had to have a rifle or was , you know , made it more difficult to get a , a , uh , a handgun . Now of course , you know , in this world anytime you 've freedom you can be able to get anything you want . Yeah , that 's true . But I guess to make it more difficult for the person who 's just so irate and upset and , you know , temporarily a little bit , uh , offset or off keel , I do n't know if that 's a large percentage of , uh , crime or not but I guess it would be some . But I , I think definitely , like today they just introduced the , what 's called the Brady bill . The seven day mandatory waiting period , Uh-huh . 

on getting any guns . And I think that , I would definitely support that . Shoot that 's a good idea . Yeah . I , I , I agree the thing that scares me , uh , though about where I would , I would wa- , definitely want some sort of legislation and coming from the north east , I 'm just not used to seeing , um , these , and I , I know this may sound kind of stereo typical but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks . Oh , sure . That 's kind of scary to me that kind of , to me it is more like vigilantism . Uh-huh . You know , and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on , Right . in L A , on the freeways , Yeah , that 's crazy . and then you come here in , in the Dallas area , um , I do n't , I do n't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles . Yeah , that 's kind of , kind of wild . Um , especially not in the back window , Uh-huh . for everybody to see . That is kind of wild . Well , that 's all very interesting . Well , thanks for talking . Sure you 're welcome . Good-bye . Okay , bye-bye .
