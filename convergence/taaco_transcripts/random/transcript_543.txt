Well , anyway I , uh , I , uh , oh , yeah . I did forget to ask you . What is your name by the way ? Uh , I 'm Ann . Oh , you 're Ann . Hi . But , uh , anyway , I , uh , lot of , lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good , be a good change if we 're going to be talking about the subject t- , tonight which in some I guess criminal courts the , Criminal courts ? Yes . Yeah . Th- , the one of which was , uh , something , something that 's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town and that is , uh , and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race . Uh , Oh , really ? Yeah . Well , they , they , uh , the , the people that MUMBLEx the , uh , the jury that 's trying , uh , the officers in that case , Uh-huh . is , is an all white panel . And there 's been a lot made in the local papers of that , I see . fact . I ca n't , I 'm a little surprised they did n't get a change of venue on that one . They have . They have . They moved it up to the county north of here . Oh . Um , it 's in Ventura and there 's , there 's still quite a bit of publicity obviously , and it 's kind of , it 's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that , uh , that , Well , that videotape was just horrible . Yeah . It was everywhere . Yes . So you know , and I , I think it would be very difficult to find someone , uh , find a panel that would be , not have seen it and , and known of what was going on . Oh , I agree with you but I ca n't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of , of discrimination or , or , you know , uh , appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff . Exactly . You know , um , the you know , 

I , I 'm kind of torn on this issue . It 's like they 're saying well on the one hand they 're not , he 's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways I think true . But on the other hand , it 's , it 's also saying that white jurors are not going to , are not going to convict . Right . Uh , you know , they 're not going to do their job . Which is the whole , the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or , or , or , uh , let go based on whether , Exactly . or not the person , whether or not the evidence says , Based on fact . Right . that there 's enough , How interesting . Oh . So what 's the prevailing thought within the community ? Um , I mean you know , what the news media is going to make of it , but what about the community ? They , well , I guess it depends on who you talk to . 

I have n't talked to , uh , I have n't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but I , I rather imagine there 's , there 's some snickering about it . And a lot of the usually fatalistic , uh , here we go again folks , Uh-huh . kind of stuff . Oh , my goodness . That ca n't be good for Los Angeles either . No , no . I , you know , on , on , on one hand you know , on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it 's sm- , they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing , 

Oh , exactly . these people beating the heck out of this guy . Um , Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like Los Angeles . 

You 're going to have it just about anywhere . Uh-huh . There . Well , But that 's , that 's interesting . Yeah . Um , What about the judge who 's hearing the case ? Is he going to be impartial ? Is he going to , be a go , a good adjudicator ? I do n't know . You know , and , and again there 's something else tha , you know , there was a , uh , something else along those lines . There was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins . I do n't know if it 's , it 's got , it 's got as much notoriety 

but it 's rather almost as infamous here as it was , as it was with , uh , the Rodney King problem . Um , a girl walked into a Korean owned store and , uh , they , she had a dispute , black girl . Uh-huh . She , she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the , with the owner of the store . The owner of the store popped her . Oh , really ? Yeah . And , and , oh , of course , they , you know , the criminal case went up and , and the judge gave the woman who shot her , shot the girl a , uh , uh , practically a suspended sentence . I mean it was -- Oh , my goodness . -- it was just , she gave her no time in jail , you know , all of these things and then , oh , there 's we have these , we have people wondering around to- , with petitions trying to get the judge , To get that judge recalled I would think . Yeah . Yeah . Huh . That 's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences . Yeah . It would make , it would make life easier . It would . Yeah . Uh , But , you would know , the whole world would know what you were facing . And then it 's a matter of , of deciding ,
