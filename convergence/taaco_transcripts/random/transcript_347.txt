Very good . Uh , discussion or on child care . Do you have any children ? Uh , they 're all grown up . Oh . I work in a day-care center and MUMBLEx . Oh , well , you know all about it then . Yes , I enjoy it a lot . It 's been quite a few years . I have grandchildren but , uh , have n't really been into selecting child care for them , so . Oh . And it 's been quite a few years since I 've had to think about that . Do they go to a day-care center or do they stay at , No . Uh , m- , my daughter that has three stays home -- Oh , that 's nice . -- with her children , and one of my daughters has one 

but an aunt keeps the baby . Oh , that 's nice . But I would , I would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays , but I would imagine it 's very hard . I , I think so . I think it 's hard to find a good day care . I have worked in anoth- , at some other ones that were not very good -- Uh-huh . -- in my opinion . But this one that I 'm in now is , is very good . And one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children . Uh-huh . And like in Pennsylvania for babies , that 's what I work with , there has to be a one to four ratio at the most . Uh-huh . No more than four babies per care giver . But we keep it down to like two to one . Oh , well , that 's good . Yeah , that makes it a little easier to deal with . I 've always thought , you know , it would be really tough . What if you had a fire or something with babies ? Oh , I know . We , You would have to be able to have enough , you know , you 'd have to be able to get them all out . What we do is we have these cribs in the back room -- Uh-huh . -- where they sleep that are , um , low to the ground and they 're reenforced real strong and they 'll sit four babies . We would just lie them in there and they roll real well and maneuver . Oh , well , that 's , that 's a , That will get them out . I had n't thought about that . But I was thinking , oh , my gosh , if they had very many babies , they could n't possibly get them all out . No . But you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out I guess . Right . Oh -- Right . -- well , that 's neat . Yeah , that 's certainly something we hope never happens . Well , do most of your day-care workers really care about the children , or is it just a job for them ? Most really care , in this center , really care . Uh , most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education . Uh-huh . And really there 's only like eight children per room 

and then there 's like two or three , mostly three care givers in each room . Uh-huh . And that enables them to spend more time with the children . Sometimes I feel like all I 'm doing is changing diapers , giving bottles , and putting babies down for a nap . So , it 's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them . Uh-huh . It 's easy to get attached to them too . Yeah . How old a group , how old are the children go with this center where you work ? Um , in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months . Uh-huh . And throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve . Uh-huh . So , I have the real , real young ones in my room . You 've got the little bitty ones . Uh-huh . Those are the , probably the bestes , the best group to have . They 're , you know , they 're wonderful . They do n't complain too much . And they 're fun . Yes . They are a lot of fun . Babies are fun , and they 're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet , so . Not quite . It 's a , when they start to crawl they try to climb up on things and -- Uh-huh . -- you have to be real careful all the , everything is baby proof . You know , all the doors have latches and stuff so they ca n't get into anything 

but they try . Uh-huh . Do you -- But , yeah , -- think there 's very many really good day-care centers around your area ? In my area because w- , I live in a college town in Penn State University -- Uh-huh . -- so I , 

there is a lot of , a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of what 's going on . Uh-huh . And , uh , in general though I 've , I 've been really disappointed with a lot -- Uh-huh . -- of other centers I 've worked at , and it , all and all it 's not my choice for when , when I have children but , but some people do n't have a choice . Sometimes it 's a have to . Yes . I hear a lot of the girls I work with , uh , constantly , oh , I wish I could find someplace I really felt good about . You know ? Uh-huh . Most of them do n't really feel that it 's a great place to leave their kids . That is sad . And it 's really bad , you know . One of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place , and then they called her one afternoon and said , well , we thought we 'd better call and tell you before you got over here . Lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today , and we just now found her . What ? They had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon . 

Oh , my God . And so immediately she says , well , I ca n't have any confidence in them anymore , if they 'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize they 're one short . Oh . But one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus . Oh , my God . And this was four hours later , you know . Oh , that poor child . And , uh , so , you know , i- , what do you do ? That 's awful . 

So she has switched to a different center now and , uh , Well , I ,
