Hello . Hello . Hi , um , this is Betty and I 'm in Richardson , Texas . I 'm Nola and I 'm in Plano . Oh , okay , well here we go .  I guess we 're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that are , that did some stuff over in the Gulf . Um . Yeah , now , did you push one ? Yeah , uh , 

Oh , okay . no I have n't pushed one yet . I just , Okay , but , I think it 's , I just started doing this so I do n't know too much about it . Okay , we 're just sort of getting acquainted here . Oh , okay . Um , you know , I , I just wanted to see if , you know , you had an opinion about this , or , you know . Uh-huh . Um , so , if that 's okay with you , then I 'll just press one . That will be fine . Okay . Well , hi , . Hi . Good morning . Um , I think I mean , if , if I start this I just wanted to say that , um , one of the things that I do n't think we really understood about the , the middle eastern situation is that they 're a totally different type of people than we are , and I mean they think differently and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours . And , and right now , I , I think that that 's been proven in the fact that , um , they have just , well , anyway , I just think that , you know , the United States policy over there , I think we should just leave them alone . I really do . In , in a major way because they just , um , that whole region over there , I think needs to settle its own differences within itself . Yeah . And that 's the way , the course that they should go , I mean , you know , we can maybe help them a little bit , prompt them , but I do n't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on . The , the thing with Israel and Palestine , I believe that should be settled between them . And also , um , you know , the other thing is their idea , or our ide- , idea of democracy has nothing to do with them . I mean , tha- , I mean , I 'm talking about the whole middle ea- , and , and maybe this is too general , but I just believe that , um , they do not look at democracy the same way we do . They do n't understand it as we do n't understand the way they live . Yeah . And , so , you know , trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just , you know , i- , I do n't think that that 's the way to go in this 

and , um , you know , it , it . Oh , well , that 's , that 's a couple thoughts on it . Yeah . I , I guess , you know , I 'd like you to maybe express something here . Well I , I , I think overall that 's right . I think it 's kind of sad though , that , for generations they 've been taught to hate each other . Yeah . And that 's , i- , you know , 

if , somewhere in there someone 's going to have to learn a different way . That 's , yeah . You know , an , an , I , I think that , um , true we do have completely different ways of looking at things , at a lot of things , but , uh , at the same time , I think there are a lot of , there is a lot of good that the United States and other countries can do , as far as example and , and , uh , , I think some different things could come from what 's happened , than what we expect . Well , ye- , well , yeah , 

um , I , I guess we could be a catalyst for their change . I , um , the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there and I do n't think we 'd be talking about this , you know , the Israeli situation , Palestinian situation , um , sort of came to a head , um , unless there had been a war . I mean that was one thing , Yeah . that came out of it , good or bad , 

I , I do n't judge any war as good or bad , it 's just a war . Yeah . 

And I do n't see any winners or losers , I just see dead bodies . I 'm sorry . You know , but , um , i- , I , I just think , you know , you 're right and I think maybe it 's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along . It 's not going to be that we 're going to , uh , you know , sort of , tell them to go to their room and that 's going to solve the whole problem . Yeah . It 's going to be them , But , that 's the type of thing they understand . Yeah . They do n't understand any other way . And , you know , And so at that , at that , you have to work at their level , It 's , to an extent , too . Yeah , that , that 's true too , I , um . They would n't have understood anything else than what we did in the war . Oh , well yeah , they , they understand violence . There was nothing else . Yeah . They love violent leaders , to , you know , I mean look at , you know , the leader they had . They , they just adored him , Yeah . because he was so strict and cruel , and , you know , for a while there he had them , be- , I ca n't figure out why they adored him . Well it has a lot to do with their religion . I got to say , Yes , yeah . that over there , um , and I know this only because from personal experience that I 'm speaking of this , because I , I 've , you know , traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I 've done that and one , one of the kindest people I 've ever met in my whole life , um , is from that area of the country 

and I mean he is just overly , he , he is abounding in kindness , let 's say . Yeah . And his wife is so godly , I mean , every thought , they have a totally different life than we have . Huh . You know , and when you add the , um , commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them . Yeah . And they have very basic life , um , well it 's just a very basic life and they just really believe in Allah , or God , or whatever . Uh-huh . And it 's , you know , everything is to the glory of Allah , and , and , you know , and , it , it 's almost like , What 's sad is that the leaders that have control -- Yeah , well that 's , -- are power , see using that , yeah . yes , and they abuse that . And it 's always been military and it 's always been , and that 's , that 's always been the way of the world . Do n't you think . Which I think that that 's not the , the way the majority of the people over there really are . Yeah . So it 's really hard , when you see the leaders , compared to the people . But I think in a , in a way the war , uh , I think in a way all , the involvement over there too , though , has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that do n't follow what those few are doing . And there are a lot of people who are good people . Yeah , yeah . You know , there 's , and I , I think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these , uh , newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the , the , uh , soldiers leaving , um , you know , surrendering and , Right and surrendering , that was , trying to get out of that situation . Yeah . And , and , the , you know , it just really comes down to people are people , you know , you have to have some compassion some humanness . That 's right . Does n't matter where the boundaries are . Um , you know , there are political boundaries and those are man made boundaries , but , you know , for heaven sakes , that 's something that 's been going on for ages , and I , I think so much of it is what you 're taught . Yeah , that 's true . You know , they teach their children , uh , in such a way that ,
