Well , how do you feel about capital punishment ? Well , I , I just last Friday got off a capital murder case . Oh , you did ? Yeah , I was on the jury . Uh , Wow . Yeah . Which is funny because I got called last night and the topic was , uh , something about juries . Oh , really ? Yeah , so I am just hitting it right . Uh , how do I feel about it ? I , I do n't know . Well , I guess it is right in certain cases . Uh , Yeah . Becau- , well , the one I was just on , I do n't , I was an alternate on the case , so I do n't know what was decided . Right . They are probably still in deliberations on it . Uh-huh . But , uh , what I found out , once , once I was declared an alternate and I was dismissed , we met with the judge , the two alternates did . Right . And , uh , he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy 

and I remember hearing about it . It was about a year ago . Uh , he was , he was involved in another one , another capital murder the very next month and he was caught just , they , they drove up , the police drove up just as he fired the g- , gun and killed the guy . Oh , wow . So he was caught and , uh , it 's interesting because the county I live in , I 'm not in Dallas county , I 'm , I 'm pretty far north of Dallas . Okay . Uh , county I live in , in the past ten years only had t- , two capital murders . Wow . And last year there were six and this guy is indicted on three of them . Really ? Yeah , so -- Wow . -- you have to wonder , you know . Yeah , well , the cases like that , they -- Yeah . -- should , 

I mean , if he 's going to be drastic , somebody has to be drastic back . Yeah , although , you know , it 's not really revenge because it does n't mean anything to him . You know , he , he has no concept of what he has done . Really ? He just , well , from what I can tell . I mean , I did n't talk to the guy or anything , but -- Right . -- I mean , he does n't seem to have any regard for anythi- , anybody 's life including his own . Wow . So , it 's , it 's kind of strange that , you know , Uh-huh . No , no remorse whatsoever , huh . No , huh-uh . Well , I guess in cases like that , you know , where the guy would , obviously , go out and do it again -- Yeah . -- I mean , you 've got to do something . 

Yeah , well , it 's funny because when , you know , they interview you before you go on the jury -- Right . -- and for capital murder , I was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours . Wow . And I , the , I was the , I think the ninety eighth person they 'd interviewed . You 're kidding . But , you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone and do you think you 'd ever know beyond a doubt and I said I ca n't imagine , I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it , yeah , I guess I could convict him , but I ca n't imagine you ever making me that sure of something . Right . But they really did . It was , it was -- Really ? -- really amazing . Well , I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun , Well , that was a subsequent case that we did n't know about . Oh , really ? And those jurors do n't know about . But this particular case , I mean , they had a complete confession from the guy -- Okay . -- with a lot of things that , that the police had n't released so no one else would have known . Oh . It was , it was really pretty interesting . Wow . What , Educational . I guess cases like that , I do n't see why they would n't bring in the new evidence from the other case . Well , they ca n't , they can , I think in the punishment phase -- Okay . -- but not in the guilt or innocence because he has n't been , he has n't been found guilty of it . Of that crime -- Right . -- but he was found guilty of anoth- , okay . Right , 

so -- That works . -- you know , it 's , although , it 's not going to take much -- Right . -- to prove that . So , Well , they pushing the death penalty ? Uh , yeah , this guy is up for the death penalty . Wow . Uh , and in Texas there is , there is a couple of questions you have to ask , uh , in the punishment phase . Uh , for example , was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation . And there is a number of questions and just depending on whether you say yes or no , uh , you , you can give him capital punishment and if you 're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment , then you can look at mitigating circumstances . 

Okay . So , So there is a lot of outs , but the only result is , otherwise he gets life in prison . Yeah , and I 'm really kind of against life in prison anyway -- Yeah . -- because it costs so dog gone much . Right , and , and to me , I mean , you take away a person 's freedom , you 've taken away most of their life . That 's true . I mean , if you 're going to put him in prison for life -- Yeah , but , 

-- with no chance for parole , But then you have to look at reality . I mean , I think , you know , normally they , they may get out so , That 's true . But what is it worth ? I do n't know . 

Uh-huh . Personally I do n't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself . That 's true . I mean , I do n't know whether I 'd stay in prison or not or , Yeah , so , you said you 're from Mississippi ? Yes , ma'am . And do they have the death penalty there ? Yes , they do . I , they 've had a , a number of cases here . Uh-huh . I mean , not a whole lot , well , Jackson , I heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year . Uh-huh . It was like last like year they had forty-nine so that 's going up . Uh-huh . But , yeah , 

they have a death penalty . I hear of one every now and then . Uh-huh . And I visited the prison up here -- Uh-huh . -- and , at Parchman and I 've been , I have n't , they wo n't let you on death row , but they 'll let you look down the hall . You ca n't see any prisoners and , and it 's kind of a weird feeling . I 've been -- -- they took us around on a tour , you know , and I went , got to walk in the gas chamber -- Ooh . -- and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you 're sitting there saying , like , people have died here . That 's right . But I guess , just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff , the people up there ,
