So the general topic is hobbies . Yes . Let 's hear about your hobbies . Well , let 's see , what kind of hobbies do I have ? I guess , uh , I , it 's more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing . I enjoy playing basketball and , and basically all kinds of sports . And , uh , Any handicrafts ? Excuse me . Any handicrafts ? No , not , not really , um , no , I 'm really not too creative well , I , uh , you know , around with my hands and things like that I leave that more up to my Mom . So , um , I think I 'm MUMBLEx in handicraft . Oh , yeah . I think it will become resume writing . Oh , well , let 's hope that you , you are n't employed by that craft for too long . Uh , yeah , I , I hate to think about it and , and I 'm getting rather good at reading want ads . Uh-huh . Yeah , it , it , Wh , what kind of time frame is it , uh , looking for the , uh , different shifts up there ? I , who knows . 

Is it , uh , basically , I had read that they 're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it , Texas , No , all means about fifteen to twenty percent , Oh , wow . of , of , oh , I 'm sure the number 's s- , somewhere classified but some of the internal news and the news services , so , it 's approximately six fifty , Uh-huh . so ten percent of six fifty , is sixty-five and twenty percent would be one thirty . Wow , how about that . Yeah , that 's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney . Yeah , that 's possible . How about that . Well , that 's , uh , that 's unfortunate is there many other , are you in the defense ? Oh , yes , MUMBLEx . Is it , uh , many other corporations in the area ? Uh , I saw Seven Eleven that was hiring . Well , I 'm sure with the new , uh , aw , contract awarding I , I think it went to Lockheed , did n't it ? Yes . That , uh , I hear they 're hiring all over the place for that . Yeah , uh , no , Apple 's coming to town and , 

Oh , really ? and that has some opportunities and , uh , and , Now is that ad good just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs ? Colorado Springs specifically , yes . How about that . 

And , uh , and , uh , M C I -s coming if , if , telemarketing is your bag . Uh-huh . Personally I 'd rather die a slow painful death but , Well , you in the , uh , computer operations or in the actual , uh , manufacturing ? Uh , I 'm a defense worker . I 'm , government tool control specialist . Right , yeah , that 's why I was in the Deseg down here in Plano also . Are you still employed ? Am I still employed by T I , no , I took a leave of , of T I back in November . Oh . Actually , December was my first month away from them . Exempt or MUMBLEx ? Exempt . Oh , yes . It , uh , unfortunately I guess for myself it was n't , uh , it was purely by my own choice . It was n't , uh , there was no incentive for myself to leave , but it was just an opportunity arose and decided to take it . Oh , so , you did n't even get the severance package . No . I should have taken the , the , the , you know , uh , option when that was there , but it was just , I missed it by a couple months . But , you know , what can one do . I 'm just happy still to have a job . So , are you happy with what you are doing now ? Yeah , I am kind of happy with it , it 's getting better all the time , I knew it would be different from the very beginning , but , you know , as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what 's going on with the system , so I was in the computer operations it 's , uh , you know , it all starts to become similar there 's , you know , there 's benefits and there 's things that were n't as good , Yeah . but as an overall package , I 'd say I 'm pretty happy so far with the way it 's turned out . Good , good . Well , it has n't been a long time MUMBLEx T I or I , Uh-huh . I 'm significantly shaken by the situation , Right . but not devastated . Uh-huh . Well , the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the , the fact that , that is more in the support of the manufacturing and there 's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the de- , the defense area but manufacturing in general . To tell you the truth , I 'm , I 'm , I 'm not really worried . Uh-huh . That 's great . That 's good . And , and I seem rather happy about it most of the time , Uh-huh . 

just , just to know , what 's , possibilities are , Sure , yeah . you know , what might happen . Sometimes it 's good just to have everything out on the table . But still in all , It may be a blessing in disguise . it feels funny . I know a number of people who are , uh , surplused and they 're just , actually , what the positions that they found outside of the company were much , much better than the ones that they currently had inside . So , despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or , or going for walks in the mountains , Exactly . I ca n't seem to get into it right now . Uh-huh , well , I 'm sure it 's just with the , the , the , the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you dec , decide on a pass , Uh , situational . I 've , I doubt I 'll be here in six months . Uh-huh . Well , would you like to be there ? I , all things being equal , yes . Uh-huh . But , or , or even somewhere better , Sure . but , God this is much better than west Texas . Uh-huh . Well , just take the day , But then they , they tell me Hell is much better than west Texas . Well , actually , uh , the , the Plano , Dallas , Houston , you know , Austin that whole area is , is actually quite , quite nice . I , my little brother lives in Austin right now . Oh , that 's a beautiful place . Goes to U T . Uh-huh . That 's just fantastic down there . Take it more as a , this is your opportunity to do whatever you want , pick out where you want to live , and then once you pick that spot out , pick out what you want to do . I , see that 's the problem . For the last many years I 've more or less let them direct what I want to do , Uh-huh . and where I want to go . Uh-huh . And just kind of go with the punches . Sure . And now I feel lost . Uh-huh . Yeah , that 's a , 

it , it takes a bit of a shift does n't it . Oh , I had job offers . Uh-huh . But , I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave . And that , Uh-huh . Well , the best thing about it is that you can , uh , try something if you do n't like it , shoot , move on to something else . That 's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here , I 'll take a chance , if I do n't like it , I 'll go someplace else , do something different . Oh so , had you been with T I long when you changed ? Five years . Yeah . I 've been with them sixteen . Yeah , I can imagine , you know , the longer and longer it goes , Actually , seventeen now , and , oh , yeah , momentum is , uh , driving force in our lives . 

Uh-huh . But , so , yeah , I 'm looking as , as a opportunity . Well , that 's good , you 've got a good attitude about it . And , and I 'm looking at it as a change . Uh-huh . And I 'm looking at it as , as an adventure . 

Right , there you go . That 's the way to do it . And maybe I 'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I do n't get laid off between now and then . There you go , that 's the thing to do . That 's much funner than doing any kind of job . Ha , how about we end this ? That will work out just fine . Nice talking to you . All right , 

nice talking to you . Bye . Good-bye .
