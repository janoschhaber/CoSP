Okay , well , I can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows -- Okay . -- and they kind of are in different spectrums , I think . Um , one of them is QUANTUM LEAP -- Okay . -- and the other one is NIGHT COURT . And I think , I think they 're real different , I mean , I do n't think they have anything in common , um , QUANTUM , LEAP has , I mean QUANTUM LEAP is kind of a comedy in its own way , I guess , but , uh , mostly it 's , it 's kind of science fiction , and , it 's , um , it 's adventure and things like that -- Uh-huh . -- and then NIGHT COURT is just pure , you know , weird fun , you know , just , it 's , it 's nothing serious about it at all . So , I do n't know why the two of them happen , to be my two favorite shows , but they , that 's the way it is , so . It 's funny that those are my two , my husband 's two favorite shows , too , and I enjoy both , watching both of them , but I used to did n't like NIGHT COURT -- Uh-huh . -- and I , and the only reason I think I like it now is because I 've seen it so much and I 'm involved with the characters , but , I used to think , um , Dan Fielding was just too , too vulgar and too crude for me . He is . And I told my husband , that 's the whole point , but -- Yeah , that 's right , I mean , -- I , I just , it 's , I find him degrading at times . I guess that is the point , but sometimes it just , Well , they , they really have changed him though . If , If you 've watched it this season , um , he 's becoming , I mean , he still is in his own way degrading and everything , but , uh , he 's involved in that charity , 

and , uh , it 's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought , that he really has , in fact , there was one show that he even turned down a date with some , you know , beautiful woman just because the idea that he was , his mind was on the ozone layer -- Oh . -- and , you know , global warming and all this other kind of stuff . And he , you know , was too depressed , you know , to , so that was part of , I guess , his character building or whatever , but , I think it adds a , probably adds a little bit of depth to his character . I have n't watched , um -- Which of course he needed . -- yeah , I think so , which in QUANTUM LEAP you get even though the person is involved in so many other people 's lives , you still see a , a real person in those situations . He gets , um , he 's doing amazing things -- Uh-huh . -- but he 's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do -- Right , right , that 's a good point , -- and I think that 's , I like that . So what do you , what do you consider your favorite shows ? Um , I think my favorite show is HUNTER . Okay . And , I , I like the old ser- , series better when , um -- Dede , 

-- Dede was in there . Yeah -- Yeah , I agree . -- and , um , so , uh , uh , and then the blond that they took out , the one that got killed -- Yeah , I ca n't remember what her name is , but is , -- yeah , I did n't enjoy her . I , I , she was too much of a opposite of Dede , and I think that 's what they try to do , but I think we wanted to see Dede there -- Uh-huh . -- or somebody like her . Well , but , see I read an article about , in T V GUIDE about , uh , about HUNTER , and about his , you know , latest , you know , his three girls , whatever you want to call them -- Uh-huh . -- and they say that , uh , that there was abso- , that there was like a conflict between her and him , uh , that they never really could get her into , uh , any character that they could use . I mean , you know , uh -- The second lady ? -- yeah , the second one -- Uh-huh . -- the blond -- Yeah , -- you know , if you think about it , they did n't really interact hardly at all -- They did n't . -- I mean , they were never partners . Yeah , she would go her way , and -- Yeah . -- he would do his , and I think that 's what I did n't like . And , and , and even , even at the beginning Dede and , and Hunter would decide that one of them would go do this , while the other one would do , would go this , but , uh , it seemed like it was almost two different organizations -- Uh-huh . -- you know , like Hunter was the boss , and this other girl was not , and , you know , you kind of , you 're wondering , you know , well when did this happen ? Right . So , yeah , I , I kind of agree with that . And I like the new lady better , but I 'd just as soon that they did n't have the romance there . I 'd just as soon have the , the police story without all the romance . Well , I 'm afraid that 's what they , they really wanted to do , um , Yeah , I think most shows were doing that , and then they went away from it -- Uh-huh . 

-- and now they 're starting to go back to it , and maybe that 's what the public wants , I do n't know , but I just , I like the , the cut and dry solve the mystery , and that 's what I always enjoyed about it . Yeah , well , see , there was that spark between Dede and Hunter for a while -- Yeah . -- but they , they like started it , and then they 'd pull it back , and they 'd start it and pull it back . And that really made it a very interesting , uh , show to where you never really knew which , which one was going to show up . You know , whether it was going to , where they 're going to be real close or whether they 're just going to be partners , you know -- Uh-huh . -- And , that , that I kind of thought was good , but , um , you know , it 's , I guess , you know , you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together , and you always wonder , why they do n't , you know , get together -- Yeah . -- or whatever . And so I guess that 's what they decide to do -- Just go ahead and -- -- Yeah . 

-- quit the wondering and , and , But it 's , it 's always been a formula , uh , for T V that the minute that two people , that the two main stars get married , that the show ends up , you know , dying . Yeah . A , a , good example of this , and , you know , this is probabl- , maybe it 's not a good example . I 've been watching Nickelodeon all last week , because they had what they called MAXIMUM SMART . They had GET SMART for , uh , ten hours a day , from seven o'clock at night , until six or until five o'clock the next morning . Oh . All the GET SMART episodes you could ever see . Well , the , the last day , all they did was the last season , to where the two of them got married -- Uh-huh . -- and that was , I mean , that was the killer , the series died right after that , I did n't , because , well go ahead . I was going to say , I did n't ever watch MOONLIGHTING , but I heard that 's what killed it -- Uh-huh , same thing . -- that , uh , interplay died when they got married , and so the show died . Yeah , the , 

it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they , they , before they get married -- Uh-huh . -- you know , the minute they get married , everything 's supposed to be cut and dried and -- Right . -- and , well , of course , another one of their mistakes , I think , is they have a tendency to change characters , or to change the characters ' , uh , uh , personalities -- Halfway through , -- well , especially after they get married . Yeah . Um , couple of examples would be , um , well , like I said , this one about Max S- , or Get Well Smart , the female character , Barbara Feldon -- Uh-huh . -- she had been at the beginning the , the intelligent one , the , the one who always solved the things and , and figured out and kept Max from getting real messed up . Well , in short , whenever they got married , she got dingy . Oh . You know , why would they do that ? Yeah . It made no sense . I , I 'm guess it 's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows -- Unfortunately , that 's probably true . -- yeah , which kind of , like in the big soap opera shows , which I do n't enjoy because of that , but , Well , do you you watch , um , what is that show , WHO 'S THE BOSS ? That 's , uh , that 's on Tuesday nights I think . I 've seen it before , but I do n't watch it regularly . Yeah , well , I -- 

Usually Tuesday nights I 'm out , so . -- I hardly ever watch it , 

but , as , as I 've seen it , they 've , they 've done sort of the same thing to where they 've , they started to let them get together , and then they pulled them apart -- 

Uh-huh . -- and I think they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about . Uh-huh . So . I always thought that was kind of weird . Yeah , it 's funny how we , uh , we , we romanticize people -- Uh-huh . -- like , for instance , where as the teenager , you know , you romance a , romanticize a rock star , but when he gets married , then you do n't care any more -- Um , right . -- or something like that , and I think it 's the same with your characters on T V . Do you think that 's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret , or at least they keep it quiet . Probably , yeah -- I mean , -- I know it affected me when I was younger . I 'm not into rock stars -- Yeah . -- too much lately , but , No , like Madonna and Sean Penn . Now I do n't particularly like either one of them -- Uh-huh . -- but , um , uh , their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together -- Yeah . 

-- or at least , that 's the way I look at it . 

Uh-huh -- So I do n't know , -- it would have been hard , would n't it . Yeah , I would think so . I just , the , the publicity in and of itself , much less the , I mean , when you get married you 've got relationship to develop in the first place , so , having twenty million people watch you do that . Yeah , it 's , they would n't be easy . Yeah . So , um , well that 's kind of interesting . Yeah . So , um , well I guess that 's about all we need to do , is n't it . Yeah , I think we 've covered our time . It 's been good talking to you . Yeah , it has been , Becky , I really appreciate it . You 're the first man I 've talked to , everyone else has been a female , so this is a change . Well , I think I 've , um , you 're the second female I 've talked to . You 've had a little bit of variety , huh . Yeah , it 's kind of nice . Okay , well , thanks so much . Uh-huh . 

Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
