So , uh , you know , my feeling is that , uh , it 's really being used today , it , it , you know , it , it really is n't doing any real good purpose for anything because it 's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal . Right , I think I 've seen some statistics that say that , uh , it 's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life . Right because y- , you , you 've got all , all the prison expenses , plus all the legal expenses . Right . Uh , and , you know , it certainly does n't seem to be a deterrent . Uh , for one thing because it 's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly do n't think the people that are committing the c- , crimes that would be eligible , you know , really care . Well , that 's , committing them mostly is , you know , either crimes of passion or at the moment or they think they 're not going to get caught or , Right , I mean , it 's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon , you know , I 'm invulnerable , I do n't need to care about this . You know , I , I , I 'm -- Yeah , b- , -- never going to get caught . Yeah , but you also have to think whether it 's worthwhile on the individual basis , for example , someone like , uh , Jeffrey Dahlmer , do you want , by putting him in prison for life , there is still a possibility that he will get out again . Yeah , one , one -- Whereas -- -- way or another . -- if you kill him , there is not that possibility . Yeah , but , but the other side to that is , if you put him in prison for life , there 's a chance that he might do things in prison , or , you know , and somehow redeem himself . Yeah , I do n't think he could ever redeem himself , 

but -- Well , -- in some cases , yes . You know , so that , you know , the , the question is , you know , the other qu- , problem with capital punishment you run into is , what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent , you know ? There are cases where , you know , twenty , thirty years after the fact of getting evidence , especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence , then , oops , I 'm sorry , guess we killed the wrong guy . 

Yeah , it 's , it 's , yeah , once you 've made a decision that way , it 's a little difficult to go back on it . Right , you , you can apologize nicely , but , you know , you know , I think , you know , the , the price , you know , it , I 've heard quotes , you know , it 's better that a thousand people go free , than one person be unjustly imprisoned . I think i , is really the , the philosophy of the way our legal system works . Oh , yeah , yeah , it 's a- , the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is , uh , based on the , uh , person who is accused . Yeah , and , you know , the , I , I think that , you know , and the way it 's being used now , it 's like you listen to Bush is , you know , well , where are we going to impose d- , you know , it 's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in , Tsongas is also saying , you know , capital , make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer . Right . And , again , I do n't thing these people care . They risk their lives every day . Yeah , and , there , there , they seem that the profit marg- , uh , drug dealers , the profit margin 's so high that , yeah -- Yeah . -- the , the risk is almost not there . Yeah , and , and , you know , uh , especially , now , I live in , in Massachusetts , you know , w- , w- , we 're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something . Yeah . So , you know , but you look at our , our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to , to like Texas or someplace that does , you know , it , it , it 's impossible to make a case that it 's , it 's affecting it in any way . Yeah . I think it 's mainly , people , like , they get the vengeance of it . Yeah , well -- Because , you know , -- it 's also , I used to live in Georgia and , you know , the , the big thing down there was , all right , we have capital punishment , but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed , it 's very racially related -- Oh , yeah -- -- and ethnically related , -- it 's mainl- , lot of blacks . Also a lot of young people . You know , a , a , a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I 've seen . Right . And , you know , I , I think when you listen to like the , uh , the , the victims ' families and things , they 're always talking about , you know , uh , feeling justified or feeling , you know , like they 've gotten something out of it , I mean , my thought has been , once the guy has been imprisoned , if he goes to jail forever or whatever , if he gets killed , it should n't make any difference to the , uh , the victim 's family . The only thing that should really , I mean , obviously , if someone of mine who has close died , I 'd probably feel differently , but -- Right . -- you know , th- , you know , what , the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society . Right and that , and , you know , also by keeping them in prison , you do have the possibility , though , we do n't currently do this , of making restitution . Right , I mean , the , You , you will work your prison job and any money you earn will go to the victim 's family . Right and , the , the other thing is that , you know , I was reading through a book on , uh , geneo , human geneo research -- 

Uh-huh . 

-- and there , more and more things like schizophrenia and why , does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin . Right . So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say , well , the problem is you , you 've got an endorphin imbalance and , you know , if you take this regularly , you 'll be a sane and productive member of society -- Uh-huh . -- you know , you really get back to the question of , you know , is someone responsible for their actions . Yeah , well , I , I think on some of it , you have to say someone 's responsible for his actions . I never like the , uh , -- Society made me do it . 

-- the defense , Yeah . Well , I never liked the , uh , insanity defense .
