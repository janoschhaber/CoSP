Okay , well I guess I enjoy eating out , um , uh , here and there , or it 's , it 's a good change and , a good change from cooking and eating at home and I guess I like a variety of , a variety of restaurants . Uh-huh . Uh , sometimes it 's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and , and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal , and sometimes it 's , I enjoy it 's , I enjoy going out having a formal meal . Yes . 

And , uh , sometimes it 's nice to go out and have a salad . Uh-huh . Something , you know , Do you usually go out , uh , with the children or without them ? Well , a variety . I , I like to go sometimes without them and , sometimes I , sometimes it 's okay to take them along . So , Right . 

Sometimes I think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner -- Yes . -- or lunches so , uh , it just , you know , it just varies , we do a mix . Sometimes it 's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband and it would n't even really matter which restaurant it was , just to , you know , have a moment of peace and quiet without -- Yes . -- little ones at the table . Yes . So , uh , I guess -- Well , -- I guess actually on those , those times , uh , we even , there are times I even say , oh , please do n't sit us next to a table with other children , this is our night out . So but , uh , anyway , where do you like to eat ? Uh , well , uh , we do n't have any children so , uh , we tend to , like to try all sorts of different things . And , uh , we 're very attracted to exotic food . Uh-huh . And , uh , we like Indian food , and Thai cuisine and , uh , sort of gourmet Mexican and , uh , things like that , as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and , uh , Chinese and things , and , and things of that sort . Now , yes , of course , we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers -- Right . -- or something like that , too . And , uh , we probably go out one to two times a week . 

Right . And , uh , uh , we 're pretty much regulars at an Italian , local Italian restaurant . Oh , which one do you like ? Momo 's . Oh , okay . Well , it 's been a long time since we 've been in there but , uh , but it 's good . There 's an Italian restaurant over , over by the mall , over by , uh , Plano Parkway there , pas- -- 

Uh-huh . -- Oh , is it Campari 's or something ? I 've heard about it , I have n't been in there . Well , it 's good . I have n't , my husband had been in there several times and we went in there , actually we went in there for lunch one day . Uh-huh . And , uh , their pastas were great . Tha- , that 's one of the things , a good pasta means a lot to me . I , I like different kinds of food . So , when we go out , I 'm always looking for something other than the standard menu , even if , it 's a Mexican Restaurant , like something other than , uh , you know the standard tacos , enchiladas , tamales and -- You 're brave . -- fajitas now . Yes , yes and once in a while things backfire . I mean , we 've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food , and things like that -- Oh , God . -- And I 'm not fond of some of those things but we 'll try , we 'll try anything . Right . Ethiopian , we 've had Ethiopian . And , uh , not in Plano of course . No , I do n't think so . But , we really , we really do enjoy going out and uh , and , um , I 'm pretty adventurous in cooking , too , which also occasionally backfires . Oh , well . Even though traditional it can backfire . Yeah . I think we 're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or , or what attracts us to a restaurant . How do you usually find a , a new restaurant ? Uh , well my husband 's kind of the eth , he , he 's the ethnic fan . So he 's , I do n't know . You know what , we read , we read the , uh , D MAGAZINE -- Uh-huh . So do we . -- we , we check that and , uh , the Friday section in the newspaper -- Uh-huh . -- the pull out section there . They often do ratings of restaurants , so -- Right . -- uh , we 've , uh , we 've usually , we often save those and ventured out on , from there , uh , just for something that had a high rating . Uh-huh . We have found , uh , a number of restaurants either through D and the , 

Friday paper and sometimes the , the OBSERVER . Which my husband usually picks up . Okay . And also through coupons . When a new restaurant opens up , they usually send out coupons . That 's , And you know , when they say , you know , buy one get one free . That 's right . It 's hard to resist , so we 'll go in . And very often we 'll , find a place that we like and we 'll stick with it once they , give , they no longer give coupons . We 'll , we 'll , uh , we 'll stay there . Oh good . Oh , good . But we 've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons , and the other half through the , through the newspaper reviews . Oh . Oh , yeah . We , I guess we , we use the coupons , too . That 's true . That 's true . I mean it 's wonderful , particularly if you have more than two people and you 've got say four or something like that . It 's very expensive to go out to eat . Oh right . Right . So , yeah that , that is really one of our , it 's almost a hobby with us . Well I think that it 's just , that 's ex , , sometimes I think going out to eat it 's , it 's sort of a recreation . Yes . So , uh , just a , just a change of pace -- Yes . -- from , uh , eating at home . So , uh -- Yeah . -- anyway . I guess , uh , as far as , as far as service when we go out -- Uh-huh . -- gosh , it 's nice , it 's nice to have someone come and wait the table . Oh , absolutely . And clear the table and , And do the dishes . Yeah , and do the dishes . And , uh , actually it 's kind of nice to , you know , I always , uh , a waitress or waiter that waits the table , it 's nice that they 're attentive but it 's not nice when they 're too attentive . Oh , yes . So , uh , we 've had experience with that , too . So , M- , m- , m- , my sister , who also lives here in Dallas , uh , tends to , uh , chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner , which drives me absolutely batty . Oh , yeah . Well , how we -- but , -- it may , it may help their tip , may not , huh . What 's your favorite restaurant ? Gosh , I guess just in Plano , I , Plano I like to go to Souper Salads . Uh-huh . Uh , Chili 's , Chili 's is always fine . Sure . I guess if we go to Dallas , into Dallas , we like , uh , the Routh , is it Routh Street Cafe . You know , we 've never been there . Well -- And that 's supposed to be wonderful . -- well , you would like it . Um . You 'd like it especially it you 're adventuresome . Uh-huh . It just , we 've , we 've taken people there several times and , uh , they have a good , they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding . I guess , it 's , whether you call it Southwestern 

but , uh , oh we had venison -- Ooh . -- venison chili one time . Which was absolutely wonderful . And then I guess it must be seasonal and we 've been back , oh , I guess it 's in the winter season well they 've never had it -- Uh-huh . -- when we 've been back , so . But , uh , well you ought to try that . It 's , it 's , it 's very good . I would probably like that . One or two times in my life I 've ever had venison , I 've loved it . But , you know , just , it 's just not , I do n't know people who hunt so , uh -- No . -- That 's , that 's supposed to be a wonderful place . W- , uh , uh , uh , here in Plano , well , we tend to go to Momo 's a , l- , fairly often . And , uh , sometimes we 'll go , you know , we , we also go to Chili 's and , uh , Colter 's Bar B Q , and , and uh , we go to , lil- , there is a little Thai place that 's over on Park that , we go to . My husband particularly likes that . We go into Dallas , a lot and , because we 're both were from the Richardson , North Dallas area , up until fairly recently . And , uh , we 'll go down to , uh , Blue Mesa Grill , Mexican food , and -- Oh , that 's good . Yes , I 've been there .
