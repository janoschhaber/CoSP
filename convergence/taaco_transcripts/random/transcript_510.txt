Okay , you want to start ? Yeah , I might as well . Uh , one of the things I 'm very concerned about the air pollution , is the , uh , this , this , the ozone layer , uh , uh , issue . Uh , I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre- , different types of freons , and that , uh , rather bothers me that , uh , I was in , in effect , uh , contributing to the delinquency of the , the environment , so to speak . Uh-huh . Yeah , that 's stuff we never even thought about three years ago . Right , right , and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven , twelve and thirteen , in , in , in that area was because they were inexpensive , 

uh , they could be made , uh , you know , inexpensive and lots of it , uh , and in that , and its properties were great , uh , with , uh , the machinery , did n't have to have lots of expensive machinery to , uh , get your heating and cooling cycles to work . Um . So . Have they stopped that practice now ? Well , course there 's a , a tremendous number of refrigerators and fre- , excuse me , refrigerators and freezers , both commercial and residential , uh , utilizing freon twelve , and of course , the new cars , I guess starting with ni- , nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems . But , uh , there 's , you know , the ton of after market machines , and et cetera , et cetera . Yeah . 

And that 's got me very , you know , highly concerned that , uh , that 's going to be quite a while before we can , uh , undo this . Now , that could spawn several good industries and help , pull us out of this recession , but you got to have people that can make , you know , earn a salary to pay for this conversion . So , so I see us in a kind , somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we , unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and , and come up with a way to , uh , have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting , uh , compound . Oh , yeah . Because as I say , there 's a , there 's a tremen- , well , how many , uh , uh , families own a refrigerator , and then do , you know , that number , and then how many a , a freezer separate from -- Uh-huh . -- and how many people , especially here in Texas , own cars and trucks with air conditioning . Yeah , yeah . 

I mean , this is , there , there are people that , that make it , have a thriving business , uh , that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on , on automobiles and trucks , and , uh , the only reason I did n't , uh , get into that more , when I was , had my little business , was because , uh , most of your , uh , air conditioning in , in , on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree -- Uh-huh . -- and I mean , so , uh , that 's why I stayed in , stayed more towar- , towards , uh , uh , and that 's a pollut- , polluting type deal too , is the excessive , um , you know , uh , petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth , and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with , with water and , uh , really make , uh , make a mess . Um , yeah , yeah , I hate to see a car going down the street , or even a truck or bus for that matter , that 's putting out a lot of dark -- Uh-huh . -- smoke , and I know there 's a lot of pollutants we ca n't even see coming out of -- Right . -- cars , but that , that particular bothers me . Well , most , most , most of the time when you see bus , uh , you know , the busses with the diesel -- Uh-huh . -- that 's , uh , those are carbon particles , and carbon dioxide and water vapor , uh , because when you , when diesel is burned it 's it , you know diesel fuel is burned in a , in the diesel engine it 's burned so completely , that you do n't have any , uh , nitrous oxides , uh , or oxides of nitrogen , uh , to , uh , form -- Oh . -- because of , by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine , because diesel oil is , uh , is not very volatile . Uh-huh . You know , where gasoline , if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it 's gone . Yeah . Diesel is going to be around , because it does n't evaporate easily , and it 's got , well , you know , its latent heat is high , but it 's slow burning at , at , uh , normal pressures . That 's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios -- Oh , I see . -- as the , as the air is heated , you know , by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one -- Uh-huh . -- ratio -- Uh-huh . -- and so if the car sucks in , uh , fifty degrees ,
