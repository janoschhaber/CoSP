Well , Julie , uh , are you in a situation where you 'd soon need to deal with , uh , special care for elderly ? Well , I do n't know . My grandfather is ninety-two years old . Uh-huh . And he is still living by himself . My grandmother died a couple of years ago . But he does n't want to , to move away . He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm . Uh-huh . And he recently had to have an operation but he just really does n't want to go to a nursing home . Is he able to , uh , still do everything himself pretty well ? Well , he was until this operation . He has arthritis . Oh , yeah . And now I do n't really think he 's doing that well . And my , a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him . And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot . Yeah . But , uh , my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three . Uh-huh . And , uh , died six weeks after they put him in the home . Yeah . And I 'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f- , grandfather 's feelings . Because , uh , I th , you know , I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of , do they still have some of their life left . And -- Uh-huh . -- and , for , for , I 'm sure , a lot of people going into a nursing home it 's like saying my life is over and I 'm just here for the rest of the stay . And so I , you know , I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home , it 's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs . Yeah -- Uh-huh . 

-- they have can look after a lot of things but there 's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore . Uh , I know my , none of my grandparents were in a nursing home . They generally were able to have someone care for them at home and they died . 

But they were all , goodness , younger than your grandparents . Like they were in their eighties . That type of thing . Uh , but I did , uh , you know , I guess , uh , when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to do , take care of themselves physically . Uh , But I just do n't think that nursing homes really do a very good job . And that 's , that 's difficult part . Because I think what they often get used as is , uh , almost like a very high level or long-term care for , uh , similar to a hospital . Uh-huh . Uh , I know , like here in Saskatchewan , we have our hospital care MUMBLEx the care actually for the older people graded in level , in four levels . And a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care . Generally are not able to look after this- , themselves to very , to a very great extent , physically . Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer 's Disease or those or , or physical and mental handicaps . Uh , you know , where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind . Even though -- Uh-huh . -- it may be minimal . And , uh , but I think that it can be helpful in that , uh , it gets people the level of physical care they need . Uh , But I do n't , I mean at least , I mean I think some nursing homes do that . But I think a lot of nursing homes really , uh , are guilty of neglect . Yeah . I th , and I think it happens more in areas where it 's , uh , I guess , uh , a broad social medical system where , uh , you know , there 's government medical care and that kind of thing . If it 's the lot where it 's funded by the individuals and , and I guess that 's sort of my lack of understanding . I think that a majority of the places in the U S , uh , you know , there is some government aid available , but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay . Uh-huh . And , uh , if you 're not able to look after yourself , then you have to rely ,
