So , um , how do you feel about the crime in your city ? Is it , uh , Well , um , Minneapolis is n't too bad . Uh , I know that there 's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders . Uh-huh . Uh , that 's kind of gone up in scale and , and some other things . Uh , I personally had a little experience the other day . Uh , somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck . Oh , really . But , actually , you know , when you look at , at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live , it 's really quite a bit better . Uh-huh . Uh , because I came from Florida and in Orlando , there 's , crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever , so . Oh , yeah . 

What part of California are you from ? San Jose , California . Oh , really ? I have a good friend there . Here , you know , the real problems are the gangs . Yeah MUMBLEx . A lot of gang related , a lot of murders , uh , just in general the whole , we 've only been here a couple of years . Uh , before that we lived in Colorado 

but in comparison to Colorado , it 's real noticeable . Oh yeah . Uh-huh . I mean you can just feel , I mean , I can just sense , I mean I wo n't even , I wo n't go to the grocery store at night . Yeah . Yeah , that 's , You know . And it , it 's that kind of thing and , uh , That 's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like , Yeah . We have a neighborhood watch program in the house , uh , the development that we live in , which I think is a great way to reduce , uh , home theft , burglary , and things -- Sure . 

-- of that sort . Do you have that where you live or , Well , uh , interestingly enough , right before I moved up here , I 'm an intern and then I go -- Uh-huh . -- back down in May . Uh , but in Orlando , before I moved up , we had a real problem with it . Uh , we 've been broken into in my apartment about four times -- Oh , no . -- in like two and a half weeks . And one of the things that I , I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation -- Uh-huh . -- down there . Uh , because they were just , it 's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because -- Uh-huh . -- everybody went to work , you know , and then the houses were left unguarded , uh , but yeah , I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it , that 's a good way to , to work it , with a neighborhood -- 

Yeah . -- watch . Well , you know , uh , also I 've heard that , uh , the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they 're home . Oh , is that right ? Like on the weekends . A high percentage of , uh , free time , I think it 's like fifty percent of most people 's free time is , uh , spent doing yard work -- Oh . -- outdoors . So they wait while you 're out , outdoors . They know the house is unlocked and then they just slip in . That 's amazing . Slip in , slip out , you know . They know exactly what they 're going for . Yeah . So , I 've heard that 's really on the rise as far as -- Uh , -- uh , you know , a new type of crime . Yeah , it almost seems like they 're getting quite a bit smarter . Yeah . Really , you know . Unfortunately , yes . Yeah , unfortunately it 's starting to really , you know , look at people 's habits and -- Uh-huh . -- where they are at particular points of the day . Yeah . Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he 's from Detroit -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , the , the crime level there , of course , is quite a bit , quite a bit , uh , more pronounced , uh -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , yeah . I guess , I mean , I think we 've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis , I 'm not real sure . Uh , Yeah , it helps to know your neighbors , you know . They give you , you 're supposed to make lists of , uh , cars . Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development . If I see a car that 's unfamiliar , we , we have a list is that what you , you did in your program ? Where you have a list of license plates ? Pretty much . Yeah . 

Yeah . I was , I was basically , involved in that , in the organization of it . Uh-huh . And then I left right in the middle of it . I 'm not sure -- Oh , uh-huh . -- where we went from there , but , Yeah . Well . Yeah , that , that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings , noticing people who look suspicious -- Uh-huh . -- uh , activities like that , sure . I mean , you , you hate to be paranoid but there are really only so many things you can do . You can have the house alarm , uh -- Yeah . -- neighborhood watch program , you know , uh , as a woman not go out at night -- Yeah . -- uh , you can do that which is what I choose to do . Yeah . One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited -- Yeah . -- even , even if you know that the threat is there -- Uh-huh . -- it 's against the law to set traps , it 's against the law to do a lot of things , you know . They could basically , uh , when I was getting robbed down in Florida , I was really considering electrifying doors -- Uh-huh . That 's , -- um , things like that like -- Uh-huh . -- they did in Miami that time . But it 's not , uh , if you kill someone in your home , as long as they are in your home , it 's considered self-defense though . That 's not always true . It is n't ? No . There was a , there was a case about two years ago -- Uh-huh . -- where a guy knew he was going to get robbed 

and essentially what he had done is set a , a elec- , a electrocution trap -- Uh-huh . -- for the burglar in his own home . 

Huh . The guy came in while he was home and , sure enough , he fell into the trap and was severely burned . He did n't die , but he was severely burned and he took the guy to court and won a settlement . Really . Yeah . So that really , that makes you think , you know . Yeah . It 's like your hands are re- , very much tied . Yeah . Well I think if , if you had ha- , a handgun though , in other words it was n't premeditated , you had a handgun , it 's the middle of the night , someone 's down- ,
