Okay , I do n't know , which end do we push but okay , Okay , well , um , let 's see , I , I think there 's a lot of people that do n't vote because they do n't really think their , their , uh , opinion is going to be heard and , you know , there 's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States and that , you know , their , yo- , vote 's not going to make that much difference and whether you vote for one person or the other person , the issues is what , you know , what you believe in , and that person is going to have a lot of , uh , 

since there 's so many issues , this one person can believe a lot of different ways on , Right , yeah . all of them so , it would be really difficult to have that one pers- , perfect person that believed exactly what you believed . That 's true , you know , a lot of people , uh , uh , I think the , that it ends up the people that , uh , vote every time , uh , elections come around are more the , the polly , uh , the party type followers , the guys that , uh , you know , follow the party lines , you know , and , Yeah . they , you know , just go in 

and if they 're Republican they vo , vote Republican every year , you know , and , uh , the people that are independent , you know , are the ones that do n't , uh , do n't really , uh , show up every year because they ca n't seem to , to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate . Right , yeah , Yeah . that 's good . Ye- , I always thought it was back when Anderson was running , I was hoping that things would change and he 'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes , but , um , Yeah . that did n't work . Yeah , there 's , uh , a lot of extremes on the parties , too , with the you know , the real , uh , far side of the Democrats they 're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago , um , the Democrat party being liberal like they are now , you know , would never be thought of , it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like , uh , moral standings and those kinds of things . Uh-huh . But , Yeah , yeah , that 's , uh , and then , and then people always get upset about it , too , because , you know , every year the , the , the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote , Uh-huh . they , they each think that , uh , if more people vote , they 'll get more votes , huh ? Yeah . I 'm always amazed at that , that each candidate thinks it 's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him , you know . Yeah . That 's , that 's true . I think in , uh , the Texas governor elections , I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody , this time . Yeah , well , that , uh , MUMBLEx I know that there 's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a pr- , pr- , predominately Catholic type area , Oh , really ? 

and when things start , uh , when , when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all insp , inspired , you know , Right . and , uh , still on the other hand we 're also , uh , this particular community is a Catholic community but , uh , uh , down in D C where , where things are a little bit different , uh , you know , it 's , it 's women 's rights and the , and that sort of movement , and so it 's , uh , quite the opposite , so elections start getting very , uh , 

the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones . 

Yeah , that 's true . But , uh , Yeah , that 's true that the different places in America that , uh , you know , different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place . Yeah , I can understand why , why some of the , the rural areas , the voter turnout is n't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for the , the Midwest , Uh-huh . and , uh , it does n't matter who they put in office , they 're going to fall subject to , uh , the pressure that the lobbyists can put , Right . Yeah , and it 's , uh , real true that , uh , you know , they 'll say one thing , 

to get elected , and then once they do get elected , they do n't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised , you know , beforehand . Right . You know , maybe it just was n't possible at all in the first place , you know , like the no new taxes thing . You know , that 's , uh , with the economy going the way it is and everything , that was nearly ridiculous -- Yeah . -- thing to , even try to do . Yeah . Well , I do n't think he 's going to have to worry about that next year . I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected . Right . Uh , Right , after the war . Uh-huh . That really , uh , Unfortunately that will probably even drop lower , the voters turndown , MUMBLEx even more because more Democrats will think that they do n't have a shot so they wo n't even bother turning out . Uh , that 's true , yeah . They 'll just say , oh , well , you know , the Republicans have this election we 'll see you in four years . Right . Yeah . MUMBLEx hope some of the local , well that 's what they , they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that are n't turning out at the , at the booths , they , they say that these older voters that , uh , you know , they , they feel like the kids are running the , the country so they , they do n't come out , turn out to vote and they 're the ones that , uh , you know , really know what 's going on , have the experience and seen , you know , how politicians can , you know , screwup or what ever . Uh-huh . But , I know , my grandmother has n't voted in years . Right , that 's , you know , neither has mine as a matter of fact . And , uh , , that 's true , they , I think they look at it as , well everybody , the majority of the people think this way , when that 's not necessarily true , because , you know , that 's what the media says . Well , the majority believes this way so , uh , they do n't even bother turning out to vote to express their , uh , opinions . So that 's , that 's true . Yeah , wonder if they 're going to take into account MUMBLEx this computerized conversation that there 's little children , you know , bouncing in your knee , the whole time you 're talking . Yeah . Do you hear the dogs in the background here ? No , I ca n't hear them . 

Okay , they 're , the children next door just opened the fence and they went off . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . But anyway , that 's , I guess we 've , uh , talked long enough and , uh , Yeah . that was sort of interesting . What part of the country are you from ? Uh , Washington , D C , Are you really ? Uh-huh . Wow . This is , I 'm in , from , this is Dallas where I 'm at . Oh , okay . The outskirts of Dallas . Well , I figured with Texas Instruments they 'd probably have a few , uh , Texans on the line now and then . Yeah , do , do you work for T I in any way ? No , huh-uh . Wow , how did you , how did they get you ? Um , they MUMBLEx , they went through engineering companies , Oh . and , uh , we 're communications . I , I work in a communications company . Oh , okay , right . I work for T I so , we saw it on the , uh , T News one day and I thought , wow , that might be interesting . Yeah . MUMBLEx sort of different . Yeah . They called me at , uh , ten o'clock one night , that was very strange . Yeah . I guess they were doing MUMBLEx Eastern Standard Time . I was like , I do n't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes . Yeah , Central Standard Time is what they 're doing it by . Yeah . Yeah . I still have n't figured out what the zero through six days which day is which yet but , I did n't study it that hard so maybe I 'll figure it out . Uh-huh . But , anyway , it was nice to talk to you and , uh , sort of meet you , and , Okay . that was an interesting topic . Yeah . Okay , well , if you 're ever in , uh , D C , come look up Wayne Sherman , you 'll say oh , yeah , talked to that guy . Okay . I 'm , I 'm Kyle Hunt , MUMBLEx Oh . too , if you ever come to , to Dallas area . 

Okay . We live right by the airport . Yeah , yeah , so do we . Oh , okay . Yeah , right next to Dulles . Yeah . All right , I 'll talk to you later . Okay . Bye-bye . Bye .
