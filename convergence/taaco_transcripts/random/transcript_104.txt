Okay , are you on any kind of , uh , regular exercise plan ? I , I , yeah , I 'm , yeah , I , I do aerobics , uh , step classes and , uh , Step classes ? toning classes , yes . What 's that ? It 's , uh , it 's a new , uh , form I think , 

uh , it 's like low impact aerobics but at , it ... Oh , instead of hopping and jumping you just step Uh-huh . Yeah , you , you have a step and you literally step up on the step and move your arms , it 's , it 's , it 's , it 's new , 

Huh . it 's fun . I probably could n't do that because of my knee . Uh-huh , bad knee . Yeah . Um , and , uh , I do toning a lot and , uh , some , every once in a while I play tennis , Yeah . I 'm not too great at it but I , I try to play , . Yeah , I 've , I 've kind of gotten out of the habit myself , I mean , it 's I guess what I do now is I play softball , Uh-huh . right now , that 's about , well , right now I 'm on two teams so it 's four nights a week . Gosh . But , uh , uh , so I enjoy it but , Uh-huh . as far as , you know , uh , instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there , Uh-huh . I went and bought a weight bench , and do n't ever hardly use it . Ha , right , ye- , I need to make myself do that . yeah , I slacked off a little because of , um , I 'm about to graduate from college and so this past couple months have been really hectic so I have n't really gone , and I 've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out but ... What school you going to ? I 'm at East Carolina . Oh . But , um , no , I , uh , my step classes and toning is about the only thing well , I mean ... Now what 's , what 's toning ? Is that lift , lifting weights ? It 's , um , like isolated movements for each muscle certain muscles groups , Oh , okay . you can do with , Isometrics , stuff like that . Yeah , you can do it with certain , you know , you can do it with weights if you wanted to but , you know , you leave out of there usually the next morning , if you have n't done it in a while , you wake up the next morning you 're like , oh , no , what did I do to myself and your whole body aches , you know . Yeah . Um , I know I 'm looking forward to getting back into getting into shape , uh , I feel like I 'm out of shape but I feel guilty for not going , Uh-huh . because I really I 'm , I 'm so used to going for , you know , three or four years now . Yeah , I , But , um , stayed in pretty good shape during school . I played baseball , Uh-huh . all the way through and , you know , working out six hours a day , usually six or seven days a week that kind of , Oh , yeah . kept us all in pretty good shape , . Oh , yeah . 

But , uh , ever , ever since I got out of school , you know , just jumped right into the job and , Uh-huh . I guess the job that I 'm in it 's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule . Uh-huh . Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling . Uh-huh . No , some , um , I walk a lot because , uh , you know , being in , in school we , Yeah . I do n't know if your campus was anything like ours , but our parking lot 's in one end of the , of the campus and the school , the buildings are all at the other end , so . You ut- , No , I did n't have , well , much of a problem we , MUMBLEx I guess I went to a small Baptist school and we had about , when I was there , maybe thirteen hundred people . Uh-huh . Oh , okay , 

that 's if ... So , it 's pretty small . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . But I usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant . Uh-huh . So , Yeah , it 's , uh , I live , I live on the second story apartments so I walk up and down stairs all day long , so . Uh , 

Uh , we 've got a one story house now that 's , that 's enough . I guess I push the lawn mower around that 's , Yeah . fairly regular . That 's one of the exercise , now . Yeah . I , I , um , would like to start running . I 've never been much of a runner but I want to start , I want to run but I do n't , I do n't know if I 'll be able to , to do it . What just , because yo- , you do n't like to or because , because you wo n't be able to . I 'm , , I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to . Oh , if you do , I wish I 'd if you do aerobics you should n't have any problem running . Yeah . I hope not . Um , We 've , we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough . Uh-huh . I do n't even own a bike , I think the last time I was on a bike when I was about twelve , so . Uh , I do n't know , I 'd be afraid , , afraid I probably forgot how to ride a bike , you know . No , you ca n't forget how to ride a bike . Yeah , but , um , no , I guess that 's about the only form , I 'm trying to think of , of other things that I do that will be considered exercise , , Yeah . there are things I should do . I know it ju- , Now , when I was going to , I , I went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred , well , when we were at this junior college , uh , our coach , you know , we , one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting . Uh-huh . So , they , uh , I mean , it was a regular , I mean , we had it for course credit , Uh-huh . but still , I mean , it was pretty high impact stuff , . Those aerobic classes are , are tough the , the high impact . Uh-huh . Definitely are , are tough classes . Yeah , and she 'd , uh , you know , most of the guys were all in one class so she 'd kind of lay it on occasionally , you know , . 

Uh-huh . First at eight , I think we had eight o'clock in the morning , was our class . Uh-huh . Wake up . Well , now they have those , uh , those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight , Uh-huh . you have like bands , I do n't know , Yeah . if you 've seen them , they 're ... I think my wife has some . Yeah , they 're , they 're weird . 

They 're , uh , you ge- , they 're just made of , I guess it 's different kinds of rubber , Uh-huh . uh , and they get , Or sand even some of them , 

well , no , they 're elastic so I guess it would n't be sand . Uh-huh . And there 's some that , like the different colors denotes how much they , how much the tension I guess they are and how easy they are to move . Huh . Uh , there 's like , I know there 's purple , gray , and , uh , green . And some of them are real short and they 're the ones that are the tough ones to use , you know . Yeah . But , uh , those classes I , I enjoy . Uh , I think , uh , with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that 's fun . If you do n't have one that 's fun , and not enjoy it , look , not acting like she 's enjoying what she 's doing , the class is not going to get out , uh , what they should get out of the class . Yeah . Uh , if the , 

So , are you going to get into instructing ? Well , what are you studying ? Oh , I 'm an interior design major , . Oh , okay , , not in the , not in the , Oh . aerobic instructor type field . No , 

no , no , no , oh , I could never do that I do n't think , . I 'd rather just be the student , . And , uh , Yeah . Occasionally I do the weights at the health club but low weights just ... Yeah , the , uh , the , some of the Nautilus equipment that I started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting , I mean , they , they , they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups , Uh-huh . with those things but , man , they are , it , ut- , I do n't know to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there , Uh-huh . 

and workout and then drive back . Right . Well , they , um , I just noticed at our health club they will put on these computerized one , these computerized machines , and you set a speed on it and the weight and it , and it makes you do it . And it tells you like if you 're going too slow it will say , my grandmother could do this faster than you . And stuff like , a turtle goes faster and , um , it tells it and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you . A little negative reinforcement there while you 're going . Yeah . So , uh , do that , stuff like that but just I 've never used those machines I just use the regular machines and the free weights , you know , like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights . Yeah . Just to do , you know , some bicep , tricep exercises . Sit-ups , of course . , yeah , that 's , that 's where I 'm really starting to get noticeable , Uh-huh . I 'm just getting real soft in the middle . Oh , yeah , I think that 's , uh , number one problem with everyone . Uh-huh . I have n't really started to put on a lot of weight I 'm , I guess I probably put on about ten , nine or ten pounds , since I stopped playing , which was about four years ago . Uh-huh . But I 've , just myself I just notice myself just really , real soft and I 'm sure I do n't have near the endurance that I did , . . Yeah . But I , I intend , I keep saying I intend to get back into it . Uh-huh . Yeah . I just need to , put the old nose to the grindstone , I , I , I guess at that point it would turn into a task , , Uh-huh . I do n't consider it fun doing that , but . Right . Yeah , I plan on getting back , once I graduate next weekend . Next weekend ? Next weekend . All right . Yeah , one week , . Then I plan to get right back into it . You know , it 's , it does a lot for you I think . Yeah , Makes you feel a lot better . oh , no , yeah , there , there 's no , no question the , the end result is great and I , I mean , I enjoyed , you know , we , when I was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired , you know . Uh-huh , and I mean you feel so much better , Yeah . 

about yourself . Uh-huh . Just that , you know , you do n't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner , . Oh , I still do n't , but . That 's a problem . Oh , yeah , yeah . Well , good luck on your graduation and your ... All righty , well , thank you . 

It was nice talking to you . Yeah , you too . Okay , bye-bye . Bye .
