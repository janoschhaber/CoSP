Do you think that there 's any way that , uh , or do you think there 's too much crime now ? 

I mean , I guess , any crime is too much but , Uh , yeah , yeah . It 's out of control . Uh , well , uh , out of control , I do n't know . I guess it could be worse . Uh , we 've , uh , we 've , we 've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood . Uh , I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington . Uh , there 's , uh , there 's a lot of problems . I mean , there 's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people and , uh , you know , we get c- , cars on our block , uh , regularly , uh , uh , g , uh , gone through , rifled through and stuff . Really ? Yeah . I would not of , okay , I would not have guessed that in Seattle . Yeah , you figured it was like Omaha , right ? Yeah . You know . No , it 's , uh , it 's not Newark , but , uh , yeah it 's got problems . Yeah , I wonder , I mean , I wonder what , what really is the answer . 

I mean , it seems like our , our , the prison systems , we ca n't seem to decide whether or not it 's a reform system or penal system . Yeah , I think most people regard it as a warehouse . Yeah . Where you put away the people that are so bad that , uh , you do n't want them out in circulation . But , but the problem is , is that we , we only have but so much room and we , we try to put aside in the warehouse , and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and -- Yeah . -- commit crimes and , That 's what I hear . So it 's , uh , Yeah , I , I think , you know , do n't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea ? I get the feeling that a lot of people have . I 'm not convinced that I have . Yeah . Uh , see , I mean , my mom taught English as a second language and , and she was dealing mostly with people that were , were in on drug crimes and , uh , 

Oh , you mean she taught in a prison ? Yes . Oh . In a -- I see . -- in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia . uh . And , the problem she had was not with the inmates at all . The , the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison . I mean , Yeah , the b- , the bureaucracy . It was , it was , I mean , they , they put her , I mean , I did n't , obviously I did n't see the classroom , uh , and , hopefully never will , but , uh -- -- they , they put her at the end of a hallway , there were no other classes going on at the time and they refused to let her wear a body al- , a body alarm . Uh . Which , and I do n't know exactly what that is , but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and , and really annoy a lot of people . Yeah . But , uh , you know MUMBLEx , So she did n't feel safe . No , she did n't . She did n't , she , she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates , and then later on the , uh , the administration kept getting worse , and , uh , she got a couple of inmates that she was n't , she did n't feel quite as comfortable around . Yeah . But , well , she had decided that it was , when we came back to the States , she decided that it was too , she did n't feel that public schools were s , were safe , so next thing you know she 's teaching in a maximum security prison . Yeah , right . But , uh , Well , at least it 's maximum security , right . Yeah . But , but the point that was , that it , you know , you said that perhaps , uh , people have given up the thought that rehabilitation 's possible and , and I 'm , I 'm thinking that it 's even to the point that the people in , that run the system have given up on it . Uh , well , I , I think the people that run , yeah , that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical , you know . Uh . I mean , I , uh , you know , I , I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff and it 's , uh , you can get pretty hardened , I 'm sure . But getting , I mean , well , see , I always have problems because , because I can never decide whether or not I 'm , I 'm supposed to be a conservative or , or a liberal but , Yeah , right . But I keep , Those are funny labels , see . I keep thinking that there 's got to be some way , that , that a lot of this is circumstances . I mean , I ca n't help but wonder if , if I grew up without a father , on the streets , and -- Oh , yeah . -- with like little or no money , would n't -- 

Oh , -- would n't I be in prison at this point ? Oh , yeah , absolutely . I think , uh , yeah , I think you can blame it on social problems . Sure . I mean , I do n't know . I mean , as , as , you know , as poverty has gotten worse , as , you know , education has gotten worse , as there 's been more single parent families , as there 's been more homelessness , there 's m- , been more crime . We 've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs ca n't -- Yeah , there 's not enough -- -- get onto the program . 

-- beds and treatment programs , rising drug abuse , and , yep , it 's a mess . I do n't , I do n't remember the , the gentleman 's name , but the , the , uh , the mayor of Baltimore is a , is a Rhodes Scholar and what he , Is he the guy wants to , like , deregulate heroin , or something ? Well , what he wants to do is take all the money that , uh , he gets for drug enforcement and use it for , uh , drug education . Uh-huh . And basically , just , just attack the problem at the demand side . Uh-huh . Stop trying to attack supply because , which , which to some extent makes sense and to some extent does n't . I mean , Switzerland tried the , the grand experiment and , you know , they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park and ,
