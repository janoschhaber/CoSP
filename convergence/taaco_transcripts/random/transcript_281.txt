Okay , what do you think is the biggest problem ? The biggest problem , well , like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools -- Uh-huh . -- that , uh , you know , you can throw money at it , but it 's , I do n't know , to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way -- Uh-huh . -- you know , because , I mean , the general values that we 're teaching -- Yeah . -- kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school , I mean , Is it the , do you think it 's the values that they 're teaching in school or the values they get from home . Uh , well , the values , more or less at home and the T V , just a general , I mean , learning is not a revered endeavor , really , I mean , it 's a lot more , it 's socially , well I wo n't say socially unacceptable , but whereas like in , uh , a person that , uh , stud- , they put a lot more emphasis on athletics and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society , and I think that carries over to school -- Right . -- a lot . So . Yeah , I , I , I , I think that the biggest problem is , uh , with the , uh , with the home environment being part of it . You know , if , I think too many parents expect , uh , the school to teach , uh , the moral aspects of , of things to the st- , to the kids and , you know , while we 're not going to worry about , uh , teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that , you know , and then expect them to pick it up at school , you 're not going to do that , you know , you 're going to carry , carry with , carry to school , uh , out into the world , you know , what you learned at home , and , uh -- Yeah . -- uh , I think that that part of that showing up now , you know , with , with things because kids I think have probably less respect than for , for people than in , in other things , than we may have seen in the past , uh , and part of it 's the , the family , I think , and part of it 's , uh , the living conditions of certain people are subjected too , drugs is a big problem now , and I think that 's , that 's , that 's another root problem . Yeah , yeah , you know , I wonder if that 's a root problem or not , because I think about that a lot , and it 's just like , everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now , but I wonder , you know , do you get the , oh , that 's kind of side tracked , but , uh , I just remember seeing on the news the other night , they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better -- Uh-huh . -- I thought , well , you know , of course they 're doing better , and not so much when I was growing up , Catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools , but , uh , they still had a , a better success rate , simply because they started with a lot better raw material . I mean everybody that went to a Catholic school had , uh , at least the parents did , at least , had education as a priority -- Right , -- like you said -- Right . -- and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it . And I wonder if , not so much that , uh , Well , I think it 's , like you say , it 's , it 's the socioeconomic mix there , you know , the , they 're , you look at the schools like that where you 've got a lot of kids who are basically , uh , that might be more well to- , well off , you know , going to a private Catholic school or whatever , uh , and , and they 're not all that way , but , you know , some that are -- Yeah . -- um , that , they 're , they 're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city , uh , you know , public schools . Yeah , this is interesting because in my mind I do n't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment , but , uh , this , this was actually inner city -- Yeah . -- people were sending , I mean , just because their kids had the ability and the , and the drive to do , try and get an education , they did n't send him to a public school , you know , like you said , you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you 're pressured not to learn in instance , 

Yeah , well , you know , in a lot of cases like that , where , you know , if kids are going to a public parochial school like that , it 's , it 's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education . It shows , I think it shows that the parents have some , uh , desire for , for the kid to do , do well , you know , and that may be passed on down to the kid as well , and , uh , maybe they pick up on that . Yeah . And then from the other aspect , um , maybe the , uh , school itself has , has , has more emphasis on , uh , trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller , uh , they may be able to , to give the resources that 's needed to , uh , to do a good job . Yeah , I mean , and what do you , what would you do to fix the school systems ? Uh , that 's a tough question -- Yeah , -- how to fix the school system . Uh , with , uh , I would try to , I guess , to see about getting parents more involved , with , try to , to come up with more ways to do that . Uh , uh , uh , stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students , and , uh , more , more classes that I think that are , 

and I think this is happening some around the country in terms of , um , morals , trying to teach the kinds of things that , that are n't getting taught at home , and , uh , and , and respect for other people . Uh , I think that 's a big part of it . You know , people , you know , if you do n't care about property and people , you know , you 're not going to care about , uh , about learning , I think . Yeah . You know , you 're not going to really care about yourself . Yeah . That 's what I was going to say . It 's the chicken and the egg thing . I wonder , a lot of times , you know , people , I mean , a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools -- Right . 

-- vandalism wise , and you get , I mean , it 's been a while since I been in high school . They 're even in grade school when they do that . But I ca n't remember exactly what goes through their head when they 're doing that . But you got to think in a way it 's kind of a outward showing of that they do n't think they have a chance of doing anything , and take it out on the school . Well , you know , and I , 

that 's not an ea , but that 's not an easy task , you know , that 's why I say , it 's , it 's a tough question what would you do , because , you know , even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when , uh , when , when you 're growing up in , you know , in a home which may be , uh , just the pits , and uh , you do n't have any , any kind of a good environment to live in , you know , it 's kind of hard to say , well , you need to take care of other people 's stuff as well , when you 're , when you barely have anything yourself . So . Yeah . I could see where that would be a problem , and I think that 's , I think it 's ...
