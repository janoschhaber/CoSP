All right ? Yes . Okay . How many kids do you have ? . I think w- , I think we 're going to talk about parents spending time with their children . We , Right . have three children who are eleven , nine , and eight . So this is the big issue with us . Although I do n't recall marking it on my little things to talk about but , perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time and , Uh-huh . Anyway . You do n't have children ? No . But you 're married ? Yeah , we , we 've been married for two and a half years . We 've been trying for about two years but -- Oh . -- no luck yet . Hopefully , You know , I know we 're not supposed to do this long distance but actually I 'm getting a call . I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting . Could I ask you to hold one minute ? Uh-huh . I 'll be right back . Excuse me , Had- , just a moment . They 're going to get mad . She had another call . She has just three kids , eleven , nine , and eight . Hello ? 

Uh-huh . I 'm so sorry . All right . That was my daughter 's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow -- Okay . -- Brownie meeting . That keeps you bu , do you have a lot of activities with your kids ? Well , I do n't want to , I do n't want this to be a unilateral conversation but , yes , we do . Both my husband and I work and our children are sixth , fourth , and third grade . And the school years are wonderful , they 're just wonderful . Uh-huh . The kids , they are real people and they are interesting and , 

they , they have all their own activities and , um , I think as parents we really enjoy them in , in our personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel . Uh-huh . So they 're pretty good kids , huh ? I 'm su , sure that 's coming though . But , Yeah . they are wonderful kids . Well , we had ni- , wh- , growing up I guess I can talk about us . We had nine kids in our family . We had eight boys and one girl . But , my Dad , uh , 

You had eight boys and one girl ? Yeah . And the time that my , we spent with our Dad was , he owned his own business so we worked with him most of the time . So that 's how we spent most of the time with him . Are you Mormons ? Yeah . That 's what the Utah and the large family . That was a dead giveaway , huh ? Well , we 're Catholics . 

I came from a family of five . I had four brothers , Uh-huh . the only girl . Oh . And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled . Which that , I never felt spoiled . In fact I always thought my toys were destroyed . I was going to say , my sister was n't spoiled very much . No . Usually busy fighting for survival . 

Yeah , that 's MUMBLEx . But , Well , I do think with working parents it is , I mean , there are some real issues here . Um , Uh-huh . that I think , um , I do n't know . It 's an interesting problem . I happen to , um , I 'm a pediatrician . Oh . My husband is a physician , so , uh , I , I MUMBLEx I talk to parents about this a lot . But children , I , I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home , um , need very early to come to grips with any guilt , Yeah . that they feel and decide what 's best for them and their family . Uh-huh . And I feel when my children were very young , I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing . And I long ago decided I 'm a better mother because I work outside the home . Uh-huh . I really believe that . And it has , um , helped us to afford some things for our children that we could n't otherwise that I think are wonderful particularly at this age , 

and I think our kids are real secure . Uh-huh . And have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot so I know it sounds like a rationalization but it 's , I really think it 's true for our family , Wel- , and I think it has worked very well . Yeah . It 's like you said , you know , to each his own . And we 're planning on having my wife stay home . And but , There 's no question , I think that 's really the best . If , if a woman is happy doing that , Uh-huh . I hate to put it quite that way . Yeah . I was twenty-nine when I had my first child and , uh , I would not have been real fulfilled . I really would not have been totally staying home with a young child . Uh-huh . It 's a wonderful , it 's wonderful to be a mother 

but , uh , I like th- , I like the way I did it . Right . I sort of worked half time . I had very flexible hours . I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year and I , Oh . you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to , to mothers . Uh-huh . Um , and I think we choose very , very carefully the , um , alternative situations that we had them in . Uh-huh . Some baby-sitting groups , again , I know it sounds like a rationalization , but I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children and they , they learn to share . They learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure . Uh-huh . I think that helps . Well , that 's good . Sounds like you 're , have a handle on it . Well , so , so . So , your wife , does she work right now ? Um , no , not right now . She 's out , Right . Well , we just moved down here . We used to live up in Seattle for a couple of years . You 're still trying to dry out ? It 's that 's no problem here . Yeah , we really liked it up there but then wh- ,
