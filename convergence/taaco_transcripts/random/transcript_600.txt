Okay . I say they , uh , probably the best things to do is , is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water if they sink -- I see . A -- -- they 're innocent right . -- a good , a good southern solution . Yeah . Uh , so , uh , how do you , how do you feel ? Th- , that 's , of course , being facetious but . Uh-huh . You 'd have to say that . 

Uh , I do n't know . The , the things they asked to talk about were whether the , uh , whether the judge should be the one that does the , uh , sentencing . Uh-huh . And seems to me that that 's , I think that 's the way it 's done now . Uh , at least , my understanding of the law which is n't very good . Uh-huh . Uh , it seems to me that the judge does it and I , I think that 's probably all right in that they , you know , maybe know what the , the norm is -- Uh-huh . -- for a particular thing . And , I guess , also what the system will absorb . Right . Probably more tuned in to that . Possibly though on , uh , capital cases like maybe the death penalty -- 

Uh-huh . -- uh , I 'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole , I mean he could have like a personal prejudice . You know , judges are people like everybody else -- That 's right . -- even though they 're , they 're supposed to be impartial but maybe , uh , And I think that may , I , that may be an exception as well . Because I think that , does n't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than , than the judge ? I , I think that 's , I think that 's the way it is . Yeah . Uh , whether they , they decide whether or not they , uh , the accused or whatever would get the , uh , get the death penalty . Do they have a death penalty in California ? . Yes . In -- Yeah . -- fact , they 're going to execute somebody at the end of this month . Uh-huh . And , uh , there 's a big uproar going on right now . Uh -- Yeah . -- the , uh , Governor , you know , has been trying to decide whether he 's going to commute it or not . Uh-huh . You know , it 's someone who had , uh , killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact . Yeah . I , something like that , I 've got no problem with it . Uh -- Yeah . -- I guess the way I think about it is not , it should n't necessarily be thought of as revenge . 

It 's just like if you 've got like a dog that 's running wild and biting people -- Uh-huh . -- put it to sleep , you know . Just get it out , you know , it 's not able to fit in , you know . Something inexpensive . Yeah . Yeah , exactly . Uh , I guess , kind of the way I think about it also , is they just , if somebody gets the death penalty , they 're , they 're judged guilty , they got the death penalty , they should have one year and one appeal . Cover all their bases with one appeal and if not , you know , do n't , do n't let them sit up there on death row for , you know , fifteen years . Yeah . I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years . Uh-huh . Yeah , that , But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and -- Yeah . Oh , I 'm sure . -- you 'd hate to be one of those . Yeah . The other thing they asked about was whether uh , uh , the verdict should be required to be unanimous . Uh-huh . Which , again , I think is the way it is now . That all the , all verdicts , well maybe not . I do n't know . At least in capital cases I 'd think they 'd have to be -- I believe it is -- -- unanimous . -- in capital . I think in like , uh , lesser cases it 's like ten out of twelve or five out of six , whatever . Uh-huh . How ever many is on , sitting on a jury . 

I t- , I believe that 's the way it is . But I 'm pretty sure you 're correct on capital cases . Uh , Yeah . The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial . Uh-huh . And that there 's one juror that is , is , uh , different than the other eleven . Yeah . And , uh , they 've only deliberated four hours or , something and they say they 're hopelessly deadlocked . Oh , no . And the judge told them , they were n't hopelessly deadlocked yet . I 'm telling you , go one way or the other . That , that 's probably an expensive trial . Uh , Yeah . 

Six months so far they said . Yeah . Probably . So . Yeah . Probably . 

You know , I 'm not sure there 's a number . It 's probably like thirty , forty thousand dollars a day you know , worth of all the free for all . Maybe they could go with a , with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their , uh , vote . Yeah . Yeah , that 's , that 's been so long I 've prac- , practically forgot who Noriega was , you know . Right . That has been going on . My , uh , cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami . Oh really ? Yeah . So she follows that stuff pretty closely . But , uh , That 's interesting . Yeah , she 's not involved in that , that case . But she does , Well have you ever served on a jury ? No I have n't . I never have . My wife has but I , I have n't . Uh-huh . I got called but I , uh , never , uh , got selected for a jury , Uh-huh . I sat for tw- , ten days -- Uh-huh . -- in a court room while they went through the selection process , and they had some guy that was , uh , defending himself . Uh-huh .
