Okay , this is really ironic that this would , I would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away . Oh , no . And it 's just been tearing me up all day . Oh , I bet . Because we have just been looking all over for him . We 've been to the pound , we 've been to the humane society , we 've been to the adoption center , we 've just been all over the neighborhood , we 've been calling neighbors . So this is just really strange . Oh , I guess so . Have you lost him before ? No , this is the first time . Um , he 's gotten out before , but he 's always stayed right here -- Uh-huh . -- you know , he 's never gone away . And so this is just really strange , you know because , What kind of a dog is he ? Um , he 's part golden Lab and part , uh , , let 's see , Alaskan , no , not Alaskan . I always forget . Yeah . Uh , Australian shepherd . Oh , boy , he 's a big one . he 's pretty big . That 's why it really surprises me , you know , that he has n't come back , because , like I said , he 's never gone away like this before , and , I would think , you know , he might , I mean , he might could get hurt by a car or something . I do n't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big . 

Yeah . You know , but , I do n't know . Oh , well , I hope he comes back , that 's too bad . Thanks , I do , too . How long have you had him ? Oh , about two years . So , he 's , Oh , that 's tough . Yeah , it 's really , gosh , anyway , Yeah , you get very attached to animals , do n't you ? That , is n't that funny how we do ? Yeah . I mean , we just really , Well , you know , they 're always there for you and they do n't talk back to you . Yeah . And , uh , it 's kind of pleasant . Well , they 're companions , Yeah , sure , sure . Well , do you have any ? Yes , we have a dog , a little white Lhasa . And her name is Angel . And we have a cat , who , a white cat . He 's , he 's just a Tabby , just a , and his name is Dominique . 

We call him Neek . Um , . But , How do they get along together ? Pretty good . Uh , we 've , we had the , the dog first , and , uh , she 's kind of a wimp and , 

and the cat kind of rules , but , uh , she likes him all right . He , we had another cat about two years ago . It got leukemia , feline leukemia -- Um . -- so we had to have it put to sleep , and , uh , then we got this new cat , so , uh . I have two children and they really enjoy the animals . 

And then my mother who 's very elderly lives with us , and she 's really good friends with the dog . They 're very , Oh , yeah . good buddies . 

That 's what are so neat about animals , I mean , they are , you know , like I said , they 're , they 're really companions , you know , and they 're friends , That 's right . 

you know . I mean , they , you can love them all you want and they love you right back and they do n't , That 's right . They do n't care what you look like , No . or what you act like , They just love you , unconditionally . I know . It 's wonderful . It 's just so neat . You know , it 's , 

that 's , I do n't know , this is just so hard . Oh , I know it has to be . It 's just , it 's like I said , we 've had him for two years 

and he 's never , I mean , he 's , he 's gotten out , but he 's always been right there . He 's never been gone for , at all -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- you know , he 's just always been right there when he gets out . Oh . You know , it 's the first time he 's ever been gone like this . Oh , that 's really too bad , that 's awful , well , Uh , I , I just knew today , uh , you know , that we looked at the pound , and that we just went all over the place , and I knew we were going to find him , you know , and when we did n't it was , like , oh , no , . So I do n't know . Well , I , I 'll , I hope you 'll find him . You most likely will . Yeah , we keep , you know , they told us like at the Humane Society and the adoption center , you know , do n't give up hope , you know , Well , have you put any posters up or anything like that ? We were talking about that tonight since , you know , he , we just , he just got out yesterday we were just talking about that whether we , we were trying to find some pictures of him recently . We 've got so many when he was a puppy , Uh-huh , yeah . you know , but we just do n't have a whole lot . We have him on film , you know , on the video camera . Uh-huh , uh-huh , yeah . You know , but you ca n't put that on the , No , you sure ca n't . you know , so , Oh , dear . So , I do n't know , I , we will probably will put some things up . Some posters and stuff up . Well , that 's good . And hopefully that will help , you know , maybe around the neighborhood . But , we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood , so that helps , too , you know , if they can keep , They can keep their eyes open , yeah . yeah , so , . That will help . Well , I think that if somebody else picks him up , I think that , uh , if he gets out he 'll come back . Yeah . You know . I really do , because he knows exactly where he lives , so , Yeah , yeah he will . I bet he does . I know , that it 's hard on you . I know that I 'd be worried , too . I know . It 's just like , it 's , it 's just so ironic that this would happen and I would get this , this kind of a call . Yeah , 

is n't it , though ? I know , That 's , it 's very strange 

but , You know , I know sometimes our cat will , will stay out all night , and when he 's not right at the door in the morning I really worry that something 's happened to him , that somebody , he 's got in a fight or , you know , somebody 's hit him and , and uh , if he does n't come by mid morning , then I really get scared . But he 's always come back eventually so , Well , that 's good . That 's one thing about cats though , they 're so small -- Yeah . -- and , you know , they can get hurt a lot easier . Yeah . You know , they can get hurt a lot easier , Yeah , you know , they can . so that would make you really , Yeah . tend to worry about them , you know , if they 're not right there Yeah . Well , but he 's a real feisty guy . He fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he does n't want them on our property . Is that right ? He 's , cats are really almost more territorial than , than dogs are . They just really do not want other animals on their property . They 're very , very he , he just any cat that comes near , and even a dog he wo n't , he wo n't jump at them or anything , but he 'll sit and he 'll watch , and , I think maybe he would if it came real close , but he 's very protective of our property . Huh . That 's really , I , I guess I really do n't know cats that well because my mother never liked them , Uh-huh . so I never had them growing up , Yeah . so , you know , I never really had them around me , you know , so I 've never owned one , you know , since I , Well , they 're really a lot different than dogs because they 're not , they 're very independent , and they 're very , he 's very affectionate when he wants to be , but if you want him to be and he does n't want to be , he 'll just , he 'll , you know either scratch you or run away . Huh . But when he wants to be , uh , he 's really affectionate . He likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and , and , and snuggle up to you , and , but if he 's not in the mood , you 'd better stay away from him . Huh . But , dogs seem to be always in the mood . They 're always , you know , right there , and like , like you to pet them and loving . Yeah , that 's true . I , I like the way they come up and they 'll , they 'll put their head underneath your hand , you know . Yeah , yeah , oh . that , and , uh , most dogs do that . I mean , Yeah , they do . I do n't know any that really do n't . I mean , you know , they know exactly how to get that attention , you know , They sure do . they just , you know , come up , and they put your , you know -- Yeah . -- or they 'll rub their , their head against you , you know . Now , do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outs- , Well , no . Well , well , he 's outside during the day and then we get home at night we do bring him in . You have a fenced yard or , Uh-huh , Uh-huh . yeah . The backyard , it 's really big , too , for him to run in and stuff . That 's why we could n't understand why he would want to get out , Yeah . you know , because he 's had all this room to run in , and , but , Well , how did he get out ? He dug a hole under the fence . Oh , boy . Well , see , he did , he did it a couple weeks ago , dug a hole , and , you know , we , we filled it back up -- Uh-huh . -- put him back in there . He did it again -- Uh-huh . -- so we chained him up -- Uh-huh . -- you know , but we really did n't want to keep him chained up because , you know , we feel like that 's just too restricting for him . Right , right . So , uh , we got , we , we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it , you know , so that he could n't get out . Uh-huh . Well , he kind of ripped through the chicken wire . Oh . So I ca n't , I , I , I just have not , I do n't understand , you know , because it 's , like , he 's got a good home , you know , he 's got , I mean , we have two kids , you know , that just love him a lot , Yeah , yeah . You know , it 's like we ca n't understand why he kept wanting to get out , you know , we just could n't , Well , you know , that , animals are like that . They like to roam and investigate . Yeah . I guess that 's , And see what 's going on . Yeah , I guess that 's probably true . I do n't think it 's anything we did . No . Least I hope not . No . I 'm sure that , yeah , No , I , I know , I mean he 's always , you know , he really does have a good home . I think that 's what really bothers me the most about it . Yeah . You know , it 's like , How are your kids handling it ? Well , I do n't know if it 's quite hit him , hit them . Uh-huh . I have two girls , Uh-huh . and they , they just been real , uh , I do n't know , at first , you know , they seemed to be upset , but now it 's like , uh , well if he does n't come home , can we get another dog . yeah , that sounds like kids . . It 's like , , wait a minute , you know , . 

Oh . poor Buddy , you know . 

I said , he 's only been gone a day and you already want to replace him . What 's his name , did you call ? Buddy . Buddy ? Uh-huh . We , that 's was our cat 's name that , that , that died . 

Is that right ? Oh , yeah . We named him , uh , we named him Buddy after , uh , Buddy Bell , uh , the Ranger baseball player that used to be here . Oh . And we used to , 

we were really into that when we got him going to the Ranger games , and we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason . But , Buddy after Buddy Bell , so , That 's funny . But , he was , he was a good cat , too . We miss him a lot , Yeah . 

and I , I feel real guilty because we had him , like , for six years and one year I forgot to get him his leukemia booster and he got it . Oh . And I just felt so bad , I , it 's real contagious and it 's , and the vet said it runs rampant in this area , I did n't know that . and if they do n't have their booster , any kind of saliva or anything from another cat , if they get in a fight it automatically , like , they get it if the other cat has it so , I had , I had no idea . Oh . I did not know that . Oh . It was , I just felt terrible . I knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was , he was just getting real skinny .
