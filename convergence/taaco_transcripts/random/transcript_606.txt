Do you know anyone that , uh , is , is in a nursing home or has ever been in one ? No . But I , my grandparents were looking into it before so I know what they 've said . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , I 'm trying to think . My , uh , uh , wife 's grandmother had Alzheimer 's and they were going to put her into a , a nursing home and , uh , they , when they put her in , she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a , a , you know , a , a nuisance . Or worse than a nuisance , I mean -- Oh they thought it was too much of a bother . 

-- she sort of went , you know , bananas and they could n't , could n't deal with her . So , I guess you need to , uh , know whether it 's a , you know , a no deposit , no return kind of thing whether , Right . If they 're equipped too , to handle the kind of patients you 're going to have -- Yeah . -- you know , put in there too . 

Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still . Right . They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her but they wanted to be independent as well . Right . Have their own room . My grandmother actually was in a , a nursing home that , uh , there was a retirement hotel and then a , uh , there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it so for , uh , the first few years she had her own apartment and , you know , made her own meals sometimes . But could , could also go and eat someplace else . Uh-huh . And then , uh , as she became less able to take care of herself , then she moved into this other part that was able to , uh , provide full-time care and , uh , she did n't have to do anything anymore . But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly . And that 's som- , I do n't know whether that 's because they , you know , sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the , the reason is . But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something . Well a lot of it 's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help . Yeah . They need health care so they 're already ill before they go . Right . That 's probably a large factor . 

Yeah . If , if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you , then you stay where you are . Then you only go there as a last resort . Uh-huh . Or people send you there as a last resort . Right , right . That 's what my grandparents , it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . Uh-huh . So that was their thinking . Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency . Right . And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make . Right . So they would n't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time . I guess that 's a problem too for people . Wait lists and all . Yeah , I guess . That , uh , you ca n't always get in when you want too and of course , you ca n't just sit around and wait . Right . When you need it , you need it -- Yeah . -- I guess . And the money is also another issue . How you 're going to pay for it . Right . At that stage of life you only have so much money left and I guess it 's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings . Yeah . I mean it is kind of fair , but it 's also not fair because they have their own children to raise . Sure . So it 's another problem . And you probably , if it were you , you probably would n't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price . Right , right . So , it , it 's just so complicated anymore , I think . People outlive their savings . And , with medicine being the way it is , you 're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down and they 're not necessarily enjoying life anymore . Yeah . 

Well maybe that 's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it 's not worth continuing . It 's just a shame that 's the way it has to be . I think -- Yeah . -- the retirement home idea 's a nice idea . To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay and cause like if your spouse died , MUMBLEx all alone , it 'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you . Right . To have friends . Yeah , I 've known quite a few people that have , uh , gone to retirement communities . I do n't know if they have them back there but here in California and in Ari- ,
