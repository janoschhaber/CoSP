Okay , sorry . Wow , that 's okay So , tell me about your home . Oh , it 's , uh , it looks like a little shot gun house , almost . It 's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other . 

Uh-huh . It 's , uh , an older home , it 's not new , I like it though , it 's big . Oh really , what kind of square footage ? Oh , I would n't know , I measured it one time , Uh . because I was , uh , we had saw some termites and we thought about getting it sprayed . I think it was like , I ca n't remember , I 'm sorry That 's okay , 

that 's okay . It 's big enough for us , though . Uh-huh . We kind of need maybe one more room . We 've got two children . Uh-huh , okay . So where do you live at , I mean wha , what part of town . In here in Denison . Okay , we- , see , that 's north . Or down here in Denison , yeah . Okay , I live , I live in Plano , so it 's north to me . Okay , up here then . I say down , I 'm really from Kentucky . I was going to say you did n't have the typical , you have a southern accent , Uh-huh . but you do n't have a Texas accent . Right . Well I 'm originally from , uh , Ohio , Cincinnati , Oh , okay . so I 'm famili , uh , familiar with , uh , That area , that dialect . Right , right Also I lived in Georgia for about four years , so the , uh , there 's a difference too , between east and west , in the south . Uh-huh . And , uh , the way in which people speak . Anyway , my home is , um , I guess it 's about twenty-five hundred square foot and I have , uh , four bedrooms at the present . We 're busting out walls and things like that . That 's what I want to do . How many kids do you have ? We have two , we have two . Do you have enough bedroom space , then ? Yeah , we 'll have enough bedroom space , it 's , we 're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small . Uh-huh . And so , we 're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it . And then shuffle the rooms around a little bit . That 's kind of like what we 'd like to do . We just had a baby a couple months ago and we 've got a den , it 's more or less a spare room . Uh-huh . We rarely go in there , except for to play chess . Uh-huh . We want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter and , uh , we need the one extra room . Like , like you said , our rooms are too s- , the bedrooms are too small , the living room and kitchen are huge , 

Right . but the bedrooms are too small . Where you 've got to leave the furniture just one certain way , you ca n't rearrange it at all . Right , there 's they , uh , I know what you 're saying there , ours is the same and they tend to put windows in the strangest places . 

Yeah . You know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for , Yeah , we 've got two great big windows in our back bathroom . Uh-huh , yo- , you 're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything , so . No privacy . No , we do n't have a lot of that , yeah . Well , we 've got at least two windows on every wall in the house . It , Uh-huh . I 'd hate to clean these windows , I really would . I figured I 'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean . Ours are the double pane and you ca n't really clean them on the inside , you know . Ours are those too , yeah . You must live in an older home too then . Right , I do , the house is about , um , I 'd say almost thirty years old . Uh-huh . So it 's not a new home , it 's , it 's seen some wear and tear . Ours has too . You know . When we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it , Uh-huh . and he did it hisself , so most of that , by now , is falling apart . Oh . You know , well I mean , it 's not just horrible , but like this tile 's come loose off the wall , the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile and I do n't like that at all . Um , that is awful . With that , uh , the great big tiles , square tiles like , that you put on the floor , Uh-huh , he did it in that ? the , the huge one . Yeah , instead of wallpaper . I would n't mind it if it was like short tiles , for that you put , The normal tiles , right . right that you put around a bathtub , that would be prettier . Uh-huh . But this looks like floor covering on the wall . It just does n't look good . Oh , and also they 're very heavy and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier . Right , there 's one big one that has come off and short of putting nails through it , we ca n't get it back on , so . Um . 

And he rewired the house and it 's shorting out here and there , and Oh , wow , I , that 's one of the things we 've been fortunate with , is our , uh , wiring is okay . We do n't have a , we do n't have enough power , um , or our breakers are n't , are n't powerful enough to take , to , to really help with the load in the house . Uh-huh . I mean we need to redo some , rewiring ourselves but our plumbing is awful . There is n- , there is a shut off valve that 's outside that does n't work , Um . and there 's no other real shut off valves inside the house , so if something breaks , we have to shut it off from the main , in the street , Yeah . you know , and , oh , it 's , it can be really bizarre . Yeah . And we never know where it 's going to flood . We 've got power surges on the west side of our house . We 've got our stereo hooked up . Uh-huh . Well that , the power makes it run . It 's never ran , 

it 's always ran just fine , the clock and stuff . Uh-huh . But it runs about ten minutes fast , except for about a month , for about a month the , the clock ran normal . Um . And then the power went off again , lightning or something knocked it out and we hooked it back up and now it 's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again . Um . But on the east side of the house it runs fine . Oh boy , you do have a strange wiring problem there . He put new wiring in , it 's all new wiring up in the attic , Uh-huh . or I guess crawl space , Uh-huh . but , uh , oh , no , he did n't know what he was doing , he really should have hired people . Well that 's something , my husband 's in construction and he wo n't even touch electrical stuff . He , i- , I mean , he 'll do a little MUMBLEx things but he wo n't do any major rewiring . He says he 'd rather pay the electrician to handle it . Right , he 'll end up killing himself . Pardon . End up killing theirselves . That 's right . My husband , he 'll change out a light switch , but that 's about as far as he 'll go . 

Well that 's the way mine is , you know , Yeah . I mean , he , he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around and he was like , oh my God , he says , looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there . And we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry , Uh , was a what , The roof was really sorry . I mean when we moved in , Uh-huh . we had no idea how bad it was . It was a wood shingle roof , and we , the first year we were living there , we had to replace the roof . Well he put , which I heard it 's a law that you 're only allowed to have three layers of shingles . 

Is it three or five , your husband probably knows . He probably knows , I do n't know what it is off hand . Well , he 's got seven layers of shingles up there , and he told us it was a completely new roof . Like I said , he did n't know what he was doing . Yeah , he must not of . 

We stripped ours , we stripped ours off . We did n't put it over , 'cause we put composition roof on . And we completely s , completely stripped all the old wood shingles off , put decking up , put the paper down , and I mean just started from scratch . Uh-huh . Unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain . Oh , no . And we , and we had , we had almost , I 'd say about half of the roof off , and it did this . And , uh , uh , a house full of snow . And a house full of snow , and rain , Uh-huh . and it came down , it did this in the middle of the night . We have plastic , you know , just tied down on everything , you know , as best we could , Uh-huh . real thick edge stuff , I mean , and the wind came in from the north and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night and we were asleep and , and I woke up and I got up and it was about four o'clock in the morning and I heard all these , these drips , drip , drip , drip , drip , drip , drip . Oh , no . I had water coming in every light fixture . That , yeah . I had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling , everywhere . And I mean it filled up my light fixtures , because they 're the old kind . 

Uh-huh . 

And I would go in , and I 'd turn on a light in the room , you know and the light would come on and the whole thing would be full of water . And I mean the light would still come on . It did n't blow up or anything . My neighbor , or a friend of mine when I lived in Louisiana , her , we all lived on base , my husband was in the Army . Uh-huh . She woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning , water dripping from hers . The neighbor 's la- , uh , washing machine had uh , over done something , I do n't know but it was leaking , just pouring water in 

and it all went through to her roof and it was coming out of the lights , fixtures . Oh . The fire alarm went off for some reason . It shorted it out , or something . Oh , yeah , that will happen . 

So she woke up with about six feet of water in her house . Oh , my lord . No , not six feet but , But it 's quite a bit , quite a bit , you know that , Yeah you might as well so . Did you have carpets and stuff ? Oh , several of our rooms got ruined , 

we have , um , we h , are on pier and beam , we do n't have concrete slab underneath our house , Uh-huh . so it , it got into the carpeting , got into the floor . The carpeting was already awful anyway , but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink s- , Your house sounds like mine because mine 's pier and beam too . Oh really . Yeah . Yeah , they came in and they had it , one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it . We had to call the insurance company . I mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the re- , roof was being repaired . Uh-huh . You know , which really was n't our fault . I mean we 'd done everything we could to keep out the weather . That 's right . That 's right . You know , and stuff and , Well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end . Oh yeah it , Are you finished with it now ? Uh , the roof ? Uh-huh . Oh yeah , yeah , it 's , it 's been done for quite some time . We 're really glad with all the rain we 've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof . Uh-huh , how long have you lived there ? Uh , see , it 's three , it 's just been a- , at three years . We 've been in the house just the three years . We 've been doing a lot of remodeling . I mean , it 's , it had detached , it had a dir- , detached garage and my husband 's built a walkway across and we 're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that so we , You all did it yourselves ? What , uh , the walk ? The home improvements . Oh yeah , yeah , he see he does this for a living , 

Uh-huh . I mean this is what ,
