Okay . Okay , I , my children as a matter of fact , are all grown now . So , I am -- Uh-huh . -- assisting them with their children -- Oh , great . -- in their selections , so . Great , well my children are grown , but they 're teenagers -- Uh-huh . -- so I have three children , um , fifteen , ages fifteen , seventeen and twenty -- Uh-huh . -- and , um , about , I guess about when the first , when the youngest one was in kindergarten I started working at a preschool -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , you know , doing some work , 

and then I , I took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool , so -- Uh-huh . -- so I am around , not a day care situation , but in the , you know , in the child care environment -- Uh-huh . -- so , um , Well , I , myself , really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today 's environment -- Uh-huh . -- than the one on one care is . Uh , when my children were growing up , I actually had them , up and until they were in the preschool situation , I had them in a , in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids , and I felt like that home environment was very important to them . Yeah . It was important to me -- Yes . -- and , uh -- Uh-huh . -- I feel like that they , they had that one on one that 's so necessary at that age . 

Oh , it is . However -- Yeah . -- in today 's environment -- Uh-huh . -- it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups , simply because that 's the way our young people are , are dealt with . Yeah , in other words , They 're dealt with , there 're more people , in packages . Yes , yes . That 's , that 's an interesting point of view . 

I , uh , you know , seeing the children in the school the way I do , I , I mean , I see the ones that , we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all -- Uh-huh . -- when they come in as three year olds -- Uh-huh . -- as opposed to the ones that have been in the program , that started at twelve months maybe , and were -- Sure . -- were even in there one day a week -- Uh-huh . -- which is all our school provides for the , you know -- Uh-huh . -- for the under three year olds -- Uh-huh . -- but still they have an op- , an opportunity to be with other children -- Absolutely , -- and it is true , and , uh , I , but I think that would , but as far as looking for a place , you know , I , the criteria , I mean , I think it 's very important to have very caring people , you know -- Oh , absolutely -- -- to take care of -- -- without a doubt , -- the , in a school -- Uh-huh . -- if you 're going to have the structure and you 're going to have the large numbers , you 're going to need really , I recently stopped by McDonalds , and I was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things , and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children , and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center , and of course , she was , she had just gotten her degree , and she was so enthusiastic , and she was excited about it 

and she was going to accomplish all of these things -- Yes , yes , -- however , uh , when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time , the pay is minimal -- Yes , it is . -- and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really do n't want to make a living for themselves -- Yes , that 's right , that maybe , -- in order to be in that environment , Yeah , that maybe have another salary in their family -- Absolutely , -- that , where they can do that , and that 's what I had the opportunity of , you know , doing -- Uh-huh . -- and , and I could concentrate on the creativity , and , and you know , really having a lot of fun with the children and -- Uh-huh . -- and providing , Well , they ask , them with a great atmosphere , so much of those caretakers for the amount that , that they pay . Yeah . 

They are to be there ahead of time , you know , they 're there early to receive the kids , And they have to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning . That 's right . which is , yeah , And then , then they have to work until the shop , until the place closes at six P M and then it 's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day -- Yeah . -- because they do n't have cleaning crews in most of those . Yes , that 's true , that 's true . And , uh , she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary . 

Yeah , yeah -- 

Uh , and she , -- because people ca n't pay -- Uh-huh . -- to provide -- Uh-huh -- and , well ours is not , you know , ours is just , is a church , and so we , we do n't have the , the expenses of a building , you know -- Uh-huh . -- we share the expense with the church , but we do n't have enough -- Sure . -- you know , taking care of a whole building -- Uh-huh . -- and that responsibility . So , uh , it is , it is a lot different . 

Well , I know that when my youngsters were small , now my older son was adopted so he went into child care at two weeks -- Oh , my goodness . -- and , uh , my younger son went into child care at six weeks . Yeah , yeah , So , they were in that environment actually , up until they became , uh , seven and nine . Uh-huh . And at that point I said , Look they have been given the custodial care that they need , and the after hours care has been as good a quality as I can provide for them . However , they 're going out into the school environment now , they 're under a lot of other influences . I need to be here for them . I need to be involved in their school , because I want to be the one -- Yes , -- who influences the way they develop . So I quit working -- Oh , you did ? -- after my kids started to school -- Um . -- and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that I could help direct their , their learning experiences and their development . Yeah , yeah . I , I felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them -- Uh-huh . -- and hold them . Yes , yes , But when time came to direct their ability to make choices -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- to develop the kinds of things that , that they 're going to need to interact with other people , I felt like I needed some strong influence there . Yeah . So , I di- , Well , that 's different than most people do it . I mean -- I know . -- a lot of people do it really the reverse -- That 's right , once they get up in sch- , -- and go to work after the children -- Uh-huh . -- are in school , you know . Uh-huh , uh-huh . But , uh . Well , I just felt very strongly about that , and I , I did not work as a matter of fact , my son was in the second grade , and when he started , uh , at Skyline High School , I asked him , Son , when , uh , you know , where do I go to sign up for the P T A ? And he said , Mom , do n't do that to me , please do n't do that to me . So I knew it was time to go back to work . But I feel very -- Yeah . -- good about spending those years with my boys . Yes , that 's true . Uh , and I was just really grateful I only had one bad child care experience . It was in a home . Uh , the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it . She was from , um , uh , uh , Argentina -- Uh-huh . -- and she was going back home , and I could n't just , you know , wait for eight , three or four months and then bring them back to her -- Yeah . -- so I had to find a new place -- Yeah . -- and I put them in this home , the kids cried when I took them , the kids cried wh , I could hear the kids crying when I went to pick them up -- Oh , dear , -- they were always cranky and irritable -- Oh , dear , -- so I just took off and went there one day , and , uh , the children were left unattended in a room , you know , they , they were not well cared for -- Oh , how awful , -- and , uh -- Yeah , -- so it did n't take me long to take them out of that place -- Yeah . -- but , that 's the only bad experience I had , 

the rest of the time they stayed in La Petite Academy -- 

Uh-huh . -- and I was very pleased with their development and their progress . Uh-huh . They learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they did n't learn , but they 're going to learn it sometime , so -- Yeah , yeah . -- but for the most part , they did have good care , and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them , and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the Y and taught to swim -- 

Uh-huh . -- which just pleased me to death -- Oh , yes , -- because I 've always been , ha- , you know , been afraid of the water -- Oh . -- however , my older son came home and he said , Mom , I do n't like that man , said , he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water -- Oh , gosh , -- and told me I had to get my face wet or I 'd never swim -- Oh , dear . -- boy , it did n't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school -- Yes . -- and relay that to them , and she said , Well , she said , you know , kids do exaggerate , but she said , let 's go ahead and send him another day , or two days , and I promise you faithfully , I will watch the instructor every minute -- Oh , good , -- and see exactly what 's happening . Yes ,
