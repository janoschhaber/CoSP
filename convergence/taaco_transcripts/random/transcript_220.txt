Okay . uh , we 're going to talk about our lawn and gard- , garden chores , do you have either one ? Well , I do n't do anything with the lawn really , but I do gardening , Do you . both flowers and vegetable gardening . Oh , really ? Um , I , we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden and that 's fun , well , actually Wally 's had one even when we have n't had big yard because , um , we enjoy that . We love fresh vegetables in the summer , and it 's just one of the things I enjoy doing . So do I . I would , I had rather be outside than , than inside any day . So would I . Do you work during the week , uh , outside the home ? Yes , I do . Uh-huh . Uh , so I manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward , I work for a school system so I 'm able to do that , um , because I get home a little earlier , Yes . and I can still do some , some sorts of things but , Or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight . Oh , absolutely . Well , I unfortunately am not gardening this year . I love gardening , in fact , I was prevented at like tw- , no , about thirty years ago with a life membership , uh , from the Richmond , Virginia counsel of garden clubs . Wow . And it was n't because I was so good , but I organized a very large garden club , but I still have , uh , Oh , that 's wonderful . It , well , it 's always something that seems so odd to me but , uh , 

But that , that 's , and you really feel you can accomplish something and to help other people too , that 's neat . Yes , it has really nothing to do with , uh , actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that , Uh-huh . it was just that I happened to organize this group , Right . that was about seventy people . That 's wonderful . That , is n't , yeah , that , that , Yeah . those numbers were , were great but it , Yeah , well , I think it sounds good . I 've never belonged to a garden club because I 've always been more interested in just doing what I can do on my own , I 've never had , Yes . the time really to get involved in the organized sort of format , but I know people who do it and , and enjoy it very much . Well , and actually , I think that most women 's garden clubs that I 've been aware of in the past , uh , are only flowers , what I would like , we 've spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma . Just moved to , to North Carolina , Oh . and , uh , we were orig- , originally , of course , from this area , from Virginia , but , uh , in North , uh , in Oklahoma , it 's the men 's garden clubs that I would have wanted to join . My word . And you would have because they do all kinds of , uh , gardening and not just flowers like women do . For heaven 's sake . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , um , there are n't men 's gardening clubs in this area that I know of , they 're , they 're women . But , um , and usually they 're the tea type things , you know , where they have a little luncheon and they do their thing . Uh-huh . But , um , flowers are primarily the emphasis , Yes , I think so too . um , whereas I enjoy vegetable gardening almost more , I do flowers sort of look pretty but I , I really like to do the vegetables . 

Yes , and , and I have spent the last ten , ten years being a florist . 

Being what ? Being a florist . Oh , my . Well , what a wonderful thing . It was nice , it was exhilarating , uh , for many years . Yes . Uh , many of those tanned until the last couple when , uh , we had such an economic slowdown . Oh , terrible yeah . Yeah , well , tell me what 's in your garden this year , since I do n't have one . 

Okay . Well , uh , the flowers I 'm just , in fact , I was going to go out today to buy some plants so I could put them in , I , I always have geraniums 

and , Uh-huh . um , and then I have a shady area that I need to , uh , be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun , so I 've discovered that , uh , impatiens that tried and true is , turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus . Uh-huh . 

Because they , uh , look pretty and , in my front garden , uh , but I like the vinca which is something I had n't , they look sort of like impatiens , you know , but they 're not quite and they 're better for the sun areas . Um , and , of course , you know , the , mine are old theory ordinary flowers , marigolds and , and that sort of thing . Yes . In my , Do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds ? No . I do n't . Maybe it 's , I do n't know , maybe this climate is a little better . Yes , uh-huh , uh-huh . Um , but in the vegetable garden we grow , um , usually , what our favorite is something called white half runner green beans , now that 's , Do you , is n't that funny , so is my favorite . Well , you know why , because I grew up in North Carolina , Okay . and that was my mother 's , um , favorite bean she alw- , she always grows , you know , five different varieties , Yeah . but that 's the kind that produces the best . Yeah , 

well , I think it has the best flavor . And , and they 're wonderful , and I pick them when they 're very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit , 

my mother picks them when they 're fat and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs , , Yes , uh-huh , well , I like them in between . and they 're good both ways . I like them in between . Yeah , yeah . The flavor is better I think in between . Oh , in between the size wise 

yeah , Yes , yeah . yeah . Uh-huh . My mother , Well , my mother does n't think they have any flavor the way I cook them . Well , and I know I love them , well , that 's the yankee way . But I think , Oh , of course . that 's like another vegetable . I love them that way just , just the thrill of , Yeah , it is . They 're two different vegetables that way , uh-huh . Uh-huh , uh-huh . In fact , I , my mother , who is eighty-six years old , canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year . Oh , my gosh . My does , mot- , mother will be th- , ninety this year and she lives in western North Carolina and , uh , she would do that if , if we did n't tell her that she 'd better not . Yes , uh-huh , yes . But she does n't have that big a garden , but she has a bigger one than I do . Real- , yes . And I have four children , you know , so , And she tends to it herself ? Oh , yes , oh , yes . Uh-huh , is n't that wonderful . Oh , it is , it 's great . It 's , it 's really her joy and I suppose that 's why I enjoy gardening , I think so too . because , you know , growing up with it . Yeah . We also grow , um , yellow and green squash , Uh-huh . um , much to my children 's chagrin , Right . and , uh , we grow a lot of tomatoes , uh , Uh-huh . 

there 's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes . No . So , we enjoy that , um , we grow I , I have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family but I actually was successful for the last two years , so . Wonderful . I 'm going to do it again . Bet you showed them . That 's right . And we grow broccoli . Oh . And I have been very , uh , happy about the new way of controlling the , the , uh , worm that gets in broccoli , um , by using the Bacillus Thuringiansis which is the , uh , little , well , in fact , that 's what they use for gypsy moth , I do n't know if you have had that problem there or not . No . But it 's , you know , it 's a problem that 's , that 's moving south from , from the New England area . Yes . And they devastate the trees so they , they spray , the government , uh , sprays , um , t- , two , three times in the spring when the , uh , caterpillars are , are coming along because what they do , this , this , uh , bacillus , um , the worms ingest it and it expands in their , in their , um , digestive tract and they die . Uh-huh . So , that 's the same technique that is , you know , for any of the other , uh , little varmints that get in vegetables so it , that 's really very nice because it 's a non toxic way of , of handling the problem . 

Great . Well , we could ch- , we could really talk gardening a long time . I 'm enjoying hearing you so much . Well , it 's nice hearing you talk and I 'm , I wish you , uh , good luck , have you just recently moved to Charlotte ? Um , a- , no , October . Oh , so , well , that 's not very long . Uh , so , yes , recently seven months and it , Yes . the weather is wonderful , I love it . Oh , that 's great , that 's great . It is just terrific , you know , rains a little too often . Well , I hope you have a , an opportunity to garden again . Oh , I think so , I have a little spinach . Oh , well , good . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
