You want to start ? Well , I guess I would first identify myself as middle aged and therefore , Uh-huh . having seen the last generation , I guess it puts me in , you know , gives me a perspective on that . Yeah . Uh , I , am quite positive on the things that I have seen happen recently relative to women in , both in society and in the work place , uh , there 's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman 's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office , but not necessarily . 

Uh , now I think the change that I 've seen as much as anything is one where couples , uh , are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will , uh , have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place . Uh-huh . And I guess that 's a significant change that I 've both participated in an- , and noticed . I agree , uh , the equality of , uh , the roles now between the sexes , I guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war , especially compared with , uh , the Vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men . Uh-huh . Uh , I have wondered why they allowed , or let , you know , both the father and mother go , uh , and the children are left without either parent . Now to me that 's kind of a drawback . But , uh , I guess it 's a price you pay . And I also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the , uh , uh , day care centers . Wonder about them in what way ? Well , uh , from what I understand there 's been studies that , uh , these children are , uh , more rebellious . Uh , they term it as more , uh , creative . Uh-huh . But , uh , that they , uh , are much more contentious . So , I , I do n't , I , I guess we 'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up , you know , in a , uh , kind of a , uh , community , Uh-huh . rather than a home . 

I have not , to be honest , had much experience , Yeah . with children in that situation . 

I , I guess one knows one 's own storly and I know , uh , in my children 's case it was one where , uh , pretty much up until the older of two was in , uh , let 's see , I guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force . Uh-huh . Uh , So they , so I guess my experience is , is just with what we did and , and so they did n't really go through the child care route . Yeah . They were able to be home together . Uh , and we never actually experienced that . What , in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the , the next generation or so , I guess I anticipate , uh , an increasing equality , uh , greater presence of women in management roles -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- uh , I do n't know whether there will be an increased amount of , of surrogacy that we see . I just do n't know . What do you mean ? Uh , deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother . Oh , yeah . Sort of rent-a-mom , to be , you know , Yeah . not to be crass about it , but , uh , That 's strange . uh , whether one might conceive , no pun intended , of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate , uh , uh -- A nanny , sort of ? -- a professional mother , a- , Uh-huh . person . Uh-huh . For instance , that , and I could , you know , I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting , uh , uh , story or whatever . Yeah . I , I do n't think I have a philosophical problem with that . In fact , I think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession . That 's right , that 's right . Uh , I , I do n't have a , other than , than a reading and , and male perspective on , on the ver- , on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not . Uh , I know that , that my sense is that I have very much an interest and had one in being a parent . I , I do n't know that I , uh , felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs . 

Uh-huh . Uh , I do n't have boys , that does n't , did n't bother me , never has . Vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or , or as a professional nanny , nanny as you put it , uh . Yeah . Maybe we 'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of , say , taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care . Uh-huh , uh-huh . It would be a sort of day care , but it would be more of a family setting . Right . Uh , I know that there are young people , characterized , I guess as being half my age , so that by definition that means , Uh-huh , uh-huh . they 're young . Uh , that , in my work place , who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman , uh , eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child , To come in and live with them ? I could easily envision that . Pardon ? To come in and live with them ? Or to put their child into a s- , into a home setting , Uh-huh . where they would , you know , like they , they would get , leave at eight in the morning and , and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and , Yeah . 

and you were paying for really high quality care . Right . Uh , I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures on , on the order of what I quoted to someone , because that 's what the experience they want and I would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that , that 's a possibility of a change -- Uh-huh . -- that we could see in the next few years . And then you might have more control over , uh , the , the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center . Uh-huh , uh-huh . I know the day care centers are not cheap either . You know they 're , I have n't ever really looked at them . Are you aware at all , Uh , well , no , of , of what they would , what they cost ? I just know , I know several single mothers who absolutely ca n't afford it . They have to go with the , a single , uh , wh- , I mean a baby-sitter more , more or less . Uh-huh . 

But I think it 's like , about sixty dollars a week for two children -- Uh-huh . 

-- if I 'm not mistaken . And you have to pay that whether you 're on vacation , you know , and taking care of the children or if the children are at home , at home , Uh-huh . sick . I mean , that is , you know , just a , a rate that you have to pay and , uh , What , what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society ? Uh , I think , I really do n't have a vision . That 's okay , too . Yeah , I , I , I think that they will be more in the work place because , uh , the door 's open . Uh-huh . And , uh , it 's just human nature to walk through an open door . So , and I would be glad to see that . I hope I do n't see a lot more single moms , but , MUMBLEx . i- , it seems in my experience I 'm running across single women all the time . I 'm , I 'm noticing that , too , and , and I notice the , the , a terming ex- , em , emerging called solo parents , Yeah . that I 'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that , that I encounter in the work place , and that , that is a little troublesome . Yeah , yeah . Uh , because the pressures on them are , are , It 's awful . rather , rather formidable . Yeah . Uh , and maybe that 's a change we 'll see . Maybe , uh , the possibility of , of women , uh , who deliberately say , no , we 'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps , Uh-huh . in the event of a separation or whatever . Right . So , Well , I think we 've done it . Well , I think we 're about done . Okay . Thank you very much . Uh , good-bye . It 's been interesting . You take care . Okay . Bye . Bye .
