Where is your favorite place to go ? Well , we have n't traveled outside the United States that much . Uh , we usually take family type vacations . We 're looking forward to one in October to Disneyworld in Florida . Oh , that 's great . 

We have a nine year old . Have you ever been there ? When , when both of my kids were much younger . And this time we 're going to be going with just one daughter and she 's nine , so it ought to just be a ball . Oh , that 's a perfect age -- Uh-huh . 

-- for Disneyworld . I think so , too . Oh , that 's great . Yeah , so we 've been there a number of times and , uh , we 're going next year . We have a business trip every fall . Well , we go on a lot of business trips . I , Oh , wonderful . I do n't work . So you travel a lot . Well , we do . We g- , my husband travels a couple times a month and in the position he 's in , they do n't care if I go along . Uh-huh . So it 's great . I just kind of join up when it 's something interesting and -- Sure . -- uh , Disneyworld is the one for a week next year -- Uh-huh . -- and it will be at this time of the year and this year we 're leaving , uh , uh , matter of fact we 're leaving next Saturday for New Orleans . Oh , that will be fun , too . Have , have you ever been there ? 

Yes . We went years ago . We have n't been lately and I know they 've changed it a lot and upgraded everything , but we used to have a lot of fun there . Well , you know , we went there once . In fact , we had been in Dallas and we were on our way home and we were driving and we said let 's go to New Orleans . So when he said , well , this year , you know , I have a week there on a , a project he 's going to be , and then I said , well , I 'll going along , I hope it 's swimming season because it was n't a tremendous thing , amount of things to do . Uh-huh . That I wanted to do there . Yeah , if you do n't like the night life and the antique shopping , there is n't much there , but , that can be fun . It , well , and that 's probably , we do like the night life , to an extent and they do have a Mardi Gras night planned . Uh-huh . And I 'm kind of anxious for that , but , uh , yours to Disneyworld sounds a little bit better . Did you know that next week there 's several T V shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary . No , I know this is a real good time to go , because they are having so many activities and special shows . Well , and with a daughter , nine , it is just , she 's old enough to really grasp -- Yes . -- the meaning behind , Be excited about all of it . Uh , so , well , if you 're working , then you 're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go . Well , not really , we 're doing the same thing . Tying it in with my husband 's business trip and I just save vacation for things like that . Oh , that 's , And , uh , just travel whenever we can . Well , I really , I think travel , when I heard my topic today , I thought , okay -- 

How easy . -- that 's my fav , that 's my favorite becau- , Right . And really at our point of life our children are grown and , uh , it has just worked out really well with this , uh , position he 's in . Uh-huh . Because I can go at a spur of the moment or what have you and it depends where he 's going whether or not I decide to go along -- Sure . -- but I do , do like to travel and it 's , uh , I do n't mind the pool life at all -- Uh-huh . -- during the day . And I like to sight see and I love to shop . Uh-huh . So it 's , So that 's perfect . What more could you ask for ? That 's right , but it , And then got to pick and choose the places . Well , and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas . Oh . Uh , that I would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas , uh , probably once every maybe year and a half . Uh-huh . And presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles -- Uh-huh . -- and so I 've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with Continental -- Uh-huh . -- and they 're recommending that you use those because they do n't know the future of Continental . Right , it 's kind of shaky . And I said now that we have all the miles , we better start using them . That 's true . Uh , It really is . So we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip . Uh , when we normally go that way , we like to go to California at the same time , because we really do n't get out there as often as you could probably -- Uh-huh . -- from Texas . Our last big trip , we drove through New Mexico and Colorado and went to the Grand Canyon and , and , uh , back through Silverton and Durango and , oh , it was fun . It was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it . Our , I think that 's a good trip . Uh-huh . And really , for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent . 

Right . Now we did , what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio and it takes a while just to even get to the , what I would call the more picturesque part of the country , we will fly to something like , once we flew to Colorado to Denver and then we rented a car for two weeks and we went through the northern route and through Utah -- Uh-huh . -- and as far west as Las Vegas and then we returned through , uh , New Mexico that you just mentioned . Uh-huh . And it was -- Oh , there 's -- 

-- oh , it was just great . -- too much to see really . Oh , I , I think that 's , that 's the way to ,
