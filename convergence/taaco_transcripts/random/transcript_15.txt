All right , um , I think the topic was crime in the city . Right . I do not live in a city . I live in a real small little place . 

Where is that ? Uh , it 's about thirty miles from Sherman . North , south , east , or west ? It 's north of Sherman . Well , you live almost in Oklahoma . Not too far . 

Yeah . That 's kind of ironic , because I do n't live too far from Oklahoma either . Huh-uh . You know where Saint Joe is ? Uh , I 've been through there . I 'm about eight miles south of it . Okay . Oh , yeah . I had been through Saint Joe , but , um , just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that , it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad . Well , you know , I 've , I 've seen those statistics and everything , and you know , what frightens me , is that , you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert -- Huh-uh . -- with high tech weaponry , you know , I mean , the Iraqis did n't have a lot of high-tech weaponry , but they had mortars and machine guns , Oh , yeah . tanks and all that . Sure . And , they did n't kill as many people in , in forty-five days , and they were intending to kill people , Huh-uh . I mean , that was their job , as they killed in Washington D C . Oh , I know , I know . I know . Um , I think nowadays people just , really just , murder is nothing to them , you know . Well , I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years , I guess . And , I 've come to the conclusion , and this is a pretty scary thought to me , even , that if a guy is convicted , or a gal is convicted , of a crime , rather than put them in prison , because prison 's proven not to work , just let them go . Say okay , you 're convicted -- Huh-uh . -- and just let them go -- Yeah . -- and if they get convicted again , well , just kill them . Yeah , because , uh , most likely that will happen , wo n't it , that , you know , Well , I think that the best hope to eliminate crime , as we know it today -- Huh-uh . -- is to eliminate the criminals from society . Huh-uh . If someone is known to have been in prison , they ca n't get a job . No . You know . Yeah . They ca n't be accepted into society . You know , if they 're not going to be accepted into society , then everybody 's going to become sociopathic . Huh-uh . And , you know , who 's to put the limit on it ? I mean , I was watching a thing last night , up in Washington State . If you get convicted of , uh , sexual offenses , on a regular basis . You know , I mean , some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions . Huh-uh . And they 're still let out on the street after one or two years . Well , in Washington State , if you 're a habitual sexual offender , they just do n't let you out . Um . So you serve your prison term , and then you go into the mental hospital , and if you 're pronounced cured , they 'll let you go . Huh-uh . Well , they may find a cure for it , but there is no known cure now . Um . So you 're , you 're kind of thinking , in other words , if you get , if you do something the first time , that 's not real bad , you know , Hey , people make mistakes . yeah , to go ahead and let them go , but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then , uh . Well , yeah , 

use that or , you know , there 's other consequences rather than killing them , you know , you could , Oh . always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against . Huh-uh . You know . Yeah . At least they might get some benefit in that , and if the people they committed a crime against , feel , at some later date , that these people have learned their lesson , are , are okay , you know , well , they can free them . Huh-uh . But , uh , you know , with the technology we have today , you can put a collar on a guy 's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property . I mean , it will just in incapacitate them . Huh-uh . And , you can put a collar around a guy 's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act . Huh-uh . But , you know , putting them in prison , my God , that does n't work . No , apparently not , because look how many years they 've been doing that and look , I mean , yeah . Well , you look at places like Turkey . Turkey has the death penalty , Huh-uh . for just about everything . Huh-uh . I mean , if you get convicted of , uh , you know , drug trafficking , they just kill you . You get convicted of , uh , you know , heinous crimes , they just kill you . I mean there 's no two ways about it . Huh-uh . And , uh , you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few . You know , and you look at our society , almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison , has been in prison three or four times . Three or four times , yeah . I mean , That is true , I know . Yeah . You know , the way to stop that kind of behavior is , is two-fold . One , you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven . 

I , I think that 's very important . Oh , I 'm , I agree very much so on that , I , yeah . And then , if a parent has proved to be unfit , for any reason -- Huh-uh . -- take the kids away from the parents . Yeah . Because , you know , we are what we teach . Huh-uh . Because that 's what our society becomes . We have , comes , yeah . We have just a bunch of people , and I 've , and I 've , I 've lived in that , that environment for quite a few years when I was doing construction work . 

You know , and these guys , they come to work every morning and they 're stoned to the bone . I mean , they 're so high , they could fly up to the top of that building and they work all day , and they go home and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs and when they run out of money , they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money , and then they go back to work on Monday . Huh-uh . And , the kids of these people MUMBLEx . 

Sure , they just think that 's the normal thing to do , do n't they ... They 're sociopathic . Yeah . And I worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester -- Huh-uh . -- and these kids were more foulmouthed than I 've ever been . I had one kid threaten my life , In the first grade . Threaten my life . Told me that daddy 's going to whoop me to death . Oh , know . You know , and they flipping me the finger and all that -- Huh-uh . 

-- and I just said to this kid , I said , you got two choices kid , you can step into mainstream society or you can die . Huh-uh . Because you will eventually be killed . And , I just , I 'm just totally aghast at a what 's going on . Oh , I know . I know , um , I work in school . You know , that 's something I do and I , it really is 

I 'm like you astonishing what the younger ages know , and they react to what they see at home . You know . Huh-uh . If they see violence at home , that 's what you 're going to get from the kids at school . Exactly . You know . It really is , and that 's kind of sad . Well , you can see it in the work place , you know . Used to be when you had a personality conflict you just , you worked with it and you got through it . Huh-uh . Now , you know , people get fired , or what 's even worse , is they promote them into a position that they ca n't handle and let them get fired . Yeah . Or , one thing or the other . You look at another kind of society like the Japanese . You put that many people on that small of a space , they 've learned to live together . Okay . It 's in their culture . Huh-uh . And one of the things that 's in their culture that I really think the major corporations should pay attention to , is the fact that , while Japan was becoming a great power , financially , the people that worked for those companies , worked for the same company they worked for at sixty-five , as they did when they were eighteen . Teen . And the company , took it upon itself to find a position for these people . If they were n't fit for the job they were hired for , they did n't just can them , they made a position for them some where . Huh-uh . You look at Frito Lay . My wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist . 

You know , transcribing stuff into the computer . Huh-uh . Well , she could type about one-hundred and five words per minute , but she do n't like it . She just does n't like to do that . I mean , she will . Yeah . But , you know , her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is ...
