All right . Okay , are you on an exercise program now or , Yeah , I exercise pretty regularly . Uh-huh . I lift weights quite a bit . Uh-huh . Um , I run occasionally . Let 's see what else do I do . Play golf some , and I work out on a , on a hanging bag . I 'm brown belt in karate , so I -- Uh-huh . -- keep up with that a little bit . Oh , yeah . How about you . Um , the only exercise program I 'm doing right now is walking . Uh-huh . I 've got a nine month old , and I 'm four months pregnant with my second , 

and so , at the time , walking seems to be the best . It 's something I can do with her , plus , um , does n't tax me too physically . Uh-huh . I have enjoyed aerobics in the past , and I enjoy that because I like the group association , you know , like exercising with other people . Yeah . And , um , and that 's my favorite way to exercise . Well , that 's neat . Yeah , I do walk some too . My wife 's about five months along -- Oh . -- so she 's been walking quite a bit , so that is a good exercise for that . Yeah , it 's nice to do it together , too , I guess . Uh-huh . My husband and I use to walk together , but our schedules do n't coincide as well as they used to , and so , we very seldom get together to walk but , when you , when you work out , do you pretty much do it on your own schedule , or do you go to groups or , I , I do it on my own schedule . Uh-huh . We used to try and belong to clubs or the Y , stuff like that , but it was so difficult to go on a regular basis , to drive the distance you have to go . Uh-huh . Save the fees , we 've , uh , just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment . So , And then you can do it whenever you want I guess . 

Yeah , I 've got a weight bench , and we got my wife an exercise bike , and I use that sometimes too . Uh-huh . 

It 's a little more convenient , but , you 're , I guess you 're not as dedicated if you do n't drive over to do it . I guess it depends on the person , depends on how motivated you are . Uh-huh . Because my husband used to work out three days a week with , uh , at the Texas Instruments gym . Uh-huh . And then I would just go on Saturdays . But , since the first of the year neither one of us have been going . Yeah . So , I guess , like I say , we 've been paying these fees and not going , so it 's kind of a waste of money if you do n't take advantage of it . Yeah , I think you really have to be disciplined . Yeah . I , uh , I try to work out at least a couple of times a week , and I think you really have to , at least twice a week , just to maintain the shape that you 're in . Yeah . With the walking , I think they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial . Uh-huh . And we , I have two friends , that we walk . They have babies that are about the same ages as , as mine , and we 've been walking every morning at , going when it was cold we would go to the mall because you ca n't take the babies out -- Yeah . -- very easily . So we , when we go , we have about , do about fifteen miles a week , but the last little while , for one reason or another , we have n't been real consistent . So it 's a little harder when you 're depending on other people to do it with you -- Uh-huh . -- because you have to meet their schedules as well , but -- Sure . -- but I enjoy doing it more when I 've got other people with me . You know , I usually do it because I want to , because I know it 's good for me , not because , I do n't feel obligated to do it . I enjoy it . If I feel too obligated to do it , I start to rebel , and I wo n't be as consistent with it . Yeah , I understand . Did you exercise between your first child and your second ? I exercised pretty well up until I found , uh , until I was pregnant , and I started having pains . So I 've calmed down everything except , I was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the , um , walking , Yeah . And I had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful . But the T I rec center has an aerobics program for , for , um , prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing . Um . 

And I was going to wait until , um , about my sixth month and then start that . I did that with the second baby , and , um , I went to my exercise class one day , and then she was delivered the next day . Gosh . So , it would seem to be real beneficial . Uh-huh , yeah . Maybe it , maybe it speeded up the process and all that . Well I think it made parts of it a lot easier . And , and is this your first that you 're having ? 

Uh-huh . Oh , okay , well , then I do n't know how much you 've been through it , but I think parts of it made a lot easier . And , I 've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and did n't with the other , and they said that they had ex- , that the one they had exercised with was three or four times easier . Really . And we 've , I had , having both of them natural , the first one was natural and going natural the second , and , and it 's , it 's rough but it 's not as bad as I thought it would be , and I think the exercise helped . Well , that 's good . So , do you work with T I ? No , I do n't . My , my wife has been working with them . Oh , okay , well then she could go if she were interested . Uh-huh . I think , that 's what the class that meets on Saturday mornings . So she could find out if she wanted to go . It 's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy , and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process . And so for us it was educational as well as exercise beneficial . So , At least it 's something you enjoy . I know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say , Well , I do n't want to exercise , it 's too much work . But there 's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you do n't have to strain yourself or sweat -- That 's right . -- or be real sore afterwards . Yeah . And sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like , Well I 've done a good job because I got , worked myself to that point . But I guess that you do n't want to overdo . 

But , well have we reached our limit ? I 'm not sure how long we 've been talking but , Yeah , I think we 've talked about six minutes or so . Okay , well it 's been good talking to you . Been good talking to you as well . Okay , I hope your baby goes well -- Thanks . -- comes out well . Yours too . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
