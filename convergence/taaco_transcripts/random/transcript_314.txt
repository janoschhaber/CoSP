Okay . Uh , well , since I initiated the call , I guess I 'll start off first . Uh , number one , I have absolutely no problem with random testing . Uh , I spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job and I feel , I would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for , particularly airline pilots and the such . I 'd feel much more comfortable than I do now , based on what I 've been hearing in the newspapers . So I really do n't have a problem with it . Yeah . Uh , I do n't either . I , uh , I 've never , I do n't work , at home right now . 

I stay home with my children . Uh , but my husband works and they do have that at his place of employment and neither of us have a problem with it . We 've , particularly , like you said with the things that the airlines and , and such . It 's , uh , it 's a scary thing to know that , uh , you just do n't know what people are doing -- Uh-huh . -- uh , before they go to work . So , and the , the advertisements on television lately have been so , uh , there have been so many . You know , there 's , uh -- Yeah . -- just about like train tr- , train wrecks and things like that , that 

I feel like , probably just for our own safety when we 're traveling and things that would be something I 'd like to know that 's going on . Yeah , I , well , I happen to be , uh , my job is I 'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world 's largest paint company , so I , it 's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause , this type of thing . 

And even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs 

and we , at the present time , do not have random testing . Um . And I am pushing towards that . I , I honestly feel if people have nothing to hide , they should n't have a problem with it . Right . And if they are trying to hide something , then I have to know that , because we 're t , we 're talking major liabilities . Not only with themselves , but with other employees . Uh-huh . And I really , you know , they , they 're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that I , I would much , much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested -- Yeah . -- on a random basis . I , I have a real fear , but that at some point something 's going to happen . And they 're showing it with AIDS , so why , you know , they sh , they ought to start doing something with the drugs . So I really have no problem with it . Yeah . Well , it 's , it 's unfortunate , I think , that everyone does n't have that opinion . Uh , some people just , uh , I 've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it 's an invasion of privacy and things like that , but , uh , in the long run , it seems to me , it 's kind of like what they keep talking about the , uh , the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things -- Uh-huh . -- and how that , you know , they feel that 's not fair and whatever , but , you know , those kind of things I 'd like to know -- Yes . -- myself . It would n't be , in my opinion , I , I 've had a lot of dental work done , and the last dentist did n't even use gloves at all , so -- Oh , really ? -- that kind of , 

yeah . And , uh , so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me . Well , that scares me because if th- , that 's the way they are , I , if I were a dentist , I 'd want to be protected , too . Well , you would think so . Uh-huh . That is , because , well , and I worked for a dentist and that 's , uh , you know , you , you come in contact with a lot of , of blood and things like that and it 's real , real dangerous . Uh-huh . I , I would think , but , with all the accidents , just with , with , uh , everything happening with , just airlines just drive me crazy . People are afraid to fly now . Right . You know , just because of , they do n't know what their pilot 's been doing and , and things like that and , Uh-huh . I do n't know . Well , you , where you 're located , I , I do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing . Uh-huh . And I think they 've had it for several years . And their program they had , I do n't think had a lot of , uh , problems associated with it , but , uh , my brother-in-law happens to work there and it , it sounded very positive . And I , I think it 's great . I , I would like , I would encourage it . I 'm pushing our company towards that . MUMBLEx . Well , and , you know , if they do find someone who , who is , uh , having a problem with drugs and they can get them the help that they need . Right . As opposed to just letting the problem go on with , without any , uh , support . Exactly . And whatever , because a lot of people , seems like , would probably obviously are trying to hide that -- Uh-huh . -- uh , from their employer and friends and family and things and too many people are just dying . Right . Particularly in our area . I do n't know what the crime is like where you are , but the crime rate here is just astronomical . Ours is changing . Yeah , ours , ours is changing , it 's increasing . I live in a , I live in a very nice suburb and it 's , it 's , it 's unbelievable what , what , what 's going on and the drugs , the selling of drugs . It 's just , it 's just too loose . It 's too free . Uh-huh . I just got a piece of paper the other day , uh , that now they have these , I have two little , very little children , under two -- Uh-huh . -- and I got a piece of paper from , from my husband 's office , it 's talking about these , uh , drug tattoos now -- Really ? -- that they have got . That look like , it looks like a sticker and it 's for kid ,
