Okay , what do you usually wear to work ? . Well , uh , I am basically retired now . Uh-huh . I was a member , I was in education and in administration , Uh-huh . Uh-huh . And , uh , heels , and I was never one , uh , because my work often took me into court , uh , never was one that got , uh , accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work . Uh-huh . But that was just me . I know many people are co , very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants . Uh , it , I guess I was just old enough not to , uh , be very comfortable in it . Uh-huh . How about you ? Well , I work at T I and they do n't really have , uh , dress code , so to speak there . It 's pretty lax about , um , you know , we- , you can pretty much wear whatever you want to , and I wear anything from jeans , when I 'm feeling really casual to , uh , suits and dresses when I 'm meeting with a customer Oh . and so when I 'm teaching a class , obviously I wear a suit or dress , Uh-huh . It , it , uh , definitely fluctuates mainly with what I 'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is and when it 's raining , I 'm more likely to wear jeans and , and when it 's really cold I 'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters , or that type of thing . Uh-huh . Um , but it just really depends on the weather and my mood and then , you know , obviously when I 'm doing anything that I 'm in front of people , or , or making presentations , teaching , whatever . Yes . I 'm going to dress up more . And I think that does make a difference , because when you do have to be in front of people , Uh-huh . uh , I think you , the , the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and , and , uh , more classical style of clothing . Uh-huh . 

What about the mini skirt ? There are a few people every now and then that wear those to work . 

They 're pretty strict about that , though . Um , I 've never worn , I just would n't , I mean even to , 

well jeans are n't exactly professional but , for some reason a mini skirt is , to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans just because it 's , maybe it 's just because of the sexist views and everything but you just feel like you 're , you 're being , showing too much le- , I do n't know , I would n't want to wear a mini skirt to work . We- , I have seen a few people do it though , but they , they were n't overly shor , and they were n't overly revealing . They were pretty much in good taste , but , um , Uh-huh . for me I just , I just , cou , would n't want to do that . Well there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts . Yeah . There are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee . Uh-huh , that 's what I 've seen . and again it depends upon the size , the shape of the person , Uh-huh . as well as the shape of the person 's legs . Uh-huh . Now , I also , uh , even though I retired from education , I , uh , I do modeling and I teach at a modeling agency here . Uh-huh . And , uh , so , when we are doing wardrobing and we have , uh , two , two hour classes in wardrobe , we do discuss a great deal , the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job . Uh-huh . Uh , even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through , uh , grandmothers , Uh-huh . in my class . And , uh , whe , I always try to emphasize the , clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad , Uh-huh . because maybe they , those are not the clothes that are the most , uh , appealing to you , or the most , uh , complimentary to you . Right . But , uh , the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you do n't really want . 

Right . And , and then , uh , then you 're in the situation where you 're very unhappy . Uh-huh . Well I feel like too , on the job , when , you know , there 's men around and some of the managers are men , you just , you know , you do n't want them looking at your legs necessarily . That 's right . And , uh , to me I just would n't feel comfortable in that at work , but , uh , Well , I , I , uh , I have to , uh , agree with that , even when they was very , very popular in the early sixties , Uh-huh . uh , I , uh , uh , again maybe because I was at the school , there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts , Uh-huh . uh , we had no regulation against it and a lot of the kids did of course , and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers . 

Right . Because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts . Right . And so , I think , uh , uh , of course , now I go the other extreme , I do not like to see , in the corporate areas , uh , all the women dressed like men , Uh-huh . 

with the suits and , uh , white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same . Uh-huh . Uh , I do n't like that , I do n't , 

I think there should be individuality in dressing . Uh-huh . Even with the very tailored look of a suit , sometimes I like to have someth- , a lit , just a little something that 's feminine . Yes . Not , you know , you do n't want to over do it but , just a little , a touch of it just to say , yes , I am a woman , Right . but I can be professional too . Well , I , and I do n't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to , to look professional . Right , uh-huh . I think that you , you make of that what you wish and you can go the opposite direction and , uh , over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you , which do n't belong in the , in , at least in my opinion , in the work place , Right . Uh , but that , that you can have a classical look without a lot of , a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine . Uh-huh . Because that was one thing I always fought against . I started out as a physical education teacher . Uh-huh . So I was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish , Right . uh , and people would never , ever guess that I was Phys Ed and , um , and that pleased me , 

Uh-huh . uh , and so , then I , of course , just continued what I considered the best style of clothing for me at work and , uh , and I find even , even at home here now , I , I will wear blue jeans or I 'll wear shorts and what have you , uh , and be very comfortable but when I go out somewhere , then , uh , unless I have a pair of dress slacks , I do n't usually wear a lot of blue jeans . Uh-huh . I have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how . Uh-huh . And , so , uh , uh , I just feel that , uh , you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort . Uh-huh . But , uh , there are certain norms that companies should be able to , uh , put out as guidelines for their employees . Right , that 's what I , one thing I like about T I is that they are n't overly strict about what you wear and they do n't , you know , your boss does n't come up to you and say now remember , tomorrow you have a meeting so you 'd better wear a suit . I mean , they , they leave it up to you and your judgment to , Right . to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have . Yes . The only real restrictions they have are , uh , no halter tops and no shorts , even the long walking short of the squirts , the , the split skirts , Yes . anything that , that could be considered shorts they do n't allow . That 's good . And they do n't allow , uh , any sweat , any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar , or , you know , anything like that on it , but , Yeah , uh-huh . other than that , it 's pretty , pretty lax and I think that 's good because it does allow people to be individual and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day . Yes . Or , you know , if you want to be comfortable and casual you can , Right . Whereas , uh , sometimes when you 're in the suit and feel , kind of almost stiff and you 're not , you know , maybe you do n't , uh , ca n't get as comfortable to sit down and , you know , like when I 'm writing training material , I prefer to be more comfortable unless I know I have to meet with a customer later during the day . Right , right . So , that 's I think , that is good that they 're like that . I do know there 's a lot of companies that are very strict about what the employees wear and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and , Yeah . you know , no variation , and I do n't , I do n't quite agree with that . Yeah , well , I do n't either . Fortunately I do n't have to work in those companies . Right . But , uh , I , I , uh , did have a group come over from one of the banks , over the children 's hospital where I was volunteering and , uh , they were doing a presentation and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly a like , men and women . They all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or sla- , or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie . Uh , right . And one was a skirt and one was a pant . Yeah . And , uh , and I think that 's sad because that does n't allow for any individuality . Uh-huh . That 's , uh , can stifle creativity . Right , I agree . So . Well , it , I guess we 've talked probably long enough . I guess so , well it 's been nice talking with you . Nice talking to you too , I enjoyed it . Uh-huh , bye , bye . Bye , bye .
