Hi , good morning . Good morning . Do you have recycling in Sachse ? Yes , we do . We 've -- Do , -- got , uh , a pickup twice a week that they come out and , they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody and they take it . Oh really ? Uh-huh . And it 's twice a week ? Uh-huh . Really ? We have , recently started , uh , a bin program here in Plano where , uh , used to be we , we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up . And now they have , uh , these large green containers and you have to put your trash that you do n't recycle in there . And then they have n't started curbside recycling yet , but they 're , but they 're planning on doing it very soon . Apparently the trucks that they had , um , lined up , they needed the parts for , Saudi Arabia . Oh . And so that put off the program for a while . But , uh , do you recycle ? Um , my kids do . Do they ? Uh-huh . Put it that way . They , they 've been recycling cans -- Uh-huh . -- for extra money . 

Uh-huh . So that 's , that 's been their summer money and they 're fixing to go to Disneyland . So , Oh , well -- So , -- that 's great . Yeah . Well that 's the way we started too . My daughter was going , to Camp Goddard , um , which is through the Plano school system , you know in the fall -- Uh-huh . -- couple of years ago and she had to earn money for it and she was too young to baby-sit . So , that 's how she started . She started recycling cans and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and , uh , aluminum cans and plastics . Really ? Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Is , is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go and they , weigh it or whatever and , No , 

MUMBLEx the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans . Um . Um , the rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling . And so , you know , we do n't get paid for that but that 's okay . Yeah . You know , it 's , it 's not that much of a bother really . You just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever and we use a lot of , two liter bottles . Um , and like milk cartons and things like that . It 's amazing how much plastic you generate . Yeah , I was amazed at how many cans -- Yeah . Yeah . -- that we got MUMBLEx because when the kids first went down , I said , that , you know that 's great and I was thinking , you know maybe I 'd help supplement it , you know -- Uh-huh . -- when they turned them in 

but it 's amazing how many cans you go through . Yeah it really is . 

And how fast they accumulate . Well all that stuff and how much , how much we have reduced our waste . Uh-huh . You know , that we , we 're generating a week . 

Um , I know our neighbors , when we first went to this bin program said , oh , there 's no way , you know we 're going to have to have pickup twice a week . They were real upset but they were n't , they were only picking up once a week . And we said to them , if you recycle , MUMBLEx you 'll , you know , you 'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container . Yeah . And , uh , it 's , it 's really amazing . The other thing he does , that my husband a real stickler about is we do n't collect our grass clippings . Really . No . He , he got a little mulcher thing . Uh-huh . It 's just a little attachment for the lawn mower and we mow once a week . You know , no , no more often then that . And then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the , on , on , the , uh , the lawn . And it 's amazing , it 's amazing . We do n't collect any of that and that , that has cut down a lot in what we throw out . Yeah , MUMBLEx we do n't e- , we do n't catch it either , mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard . So , if it mows , gets mowed , I do it normally . Uh-huh . And I ca n't mow the yard with the grass catch on it . It 's too heavy . Yeah . So I just m , I just mow it and leave it . Yeah . 

It just soaks in . Sure it does . Sure it does . It really does and it , actually they say that you 're wasting fertilizer -- Uh-huh . -- if you 're not , uh , if you 're catching your grass clippings . That , that 's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn . It 's amazing . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Oh , I like it better doing it . Well one , it cuts down on my mow time anyway -- Uh-huh , that 's true . -- and you zip through it quicker . That 's true . That 's true . Well , I , I really think you 're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it . Proba- , we probably will . It 's , it 's really not that much trouble . We keep a large plastic , uh , just a , you know , a garbage bag in the garage . Yeah . And as soon as we use something , you know , we crush it up and put it out there and then , you know , every few weeks we have recycling , a recycling center like near Wal-Mart . Uh-huh . They 're , they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in and it 's really no trouble . And , uh , I feel like at least we 're doing something . Yeah . 

You know , MUMBLEx , um , I read a book one time or a m- , a magazine article and they said something about how you do n't realize even just your small contribution , it seems like a small contribution but it 's not . If everyone were to recycle just their newspapers , they would s , save thousands and thousands of trees a day . 

Really . A day , just from not throwing out your newspapers . And , uh , when you read that you think , well gee , maybe it is a big deal , you know . What , what makes me sick is , is when they show the dump sites -- Uh-huh . -- you know , and , and , how big they are . Uh-huh . Or like in New York , the barges that -- Yes . -- that go up and down the , the river -- Yeah . -- and they do n't have any place to put it and it just floats in the MUMBLEx , it 's like ugh . Yeah , yeah , yeah . And that 's , and that 's really not necessary . No . It really is n't if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference . It would make a huge impact . So , I 'm excited about the recycling program in Plano . I , I , ca n't wait for them to get it started . Um , because it 'll be that much easier for us , you know , like I said , now we have to take it over to , to Wal-Mart . It would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up . Yeah . It , it 's -- Um , 

-- it 's convenient out here for them to do it . Now what , what do they pick up ? It 's just , They pick up the , the plastic , the glass , and the newspaper . Oh they do ? Uh-huh . Uh-huh . And do you have to sort that ? And they will do the alum- , Or do you just put it all in . No , you just put it in the one bin and , and I guess they do the sorting . But , um , they 'll do the aluminum cans too but we do n't give them those . Right . Right . The kids keep those . So , So you 're doing that now ? You 're doing the newspapers and the glass ? Uh-huh . 

Well -- Oh , uh-huh . -- we do n't , we do n't take the newspaper to begin with . When , neither one of us are home t- , -- Uh-huh . -- to read it . Uh-huh . So we do n't have the newspapers but the , the plastic and the glass . At first , when it first started , it , it , it was hard . Uh-huh . You know , because you 're just used to throwing things . My husband would , come home and go through the trash -- Uh ! -- and say , you threw this away . He would get , he would get all upset and I 'd say , it 's just such an automatic reaction . And now -- It is . -- we think before we throw anything away . I mean , it 's really funny . We , we really , once you get into the habit of it , it 's okay , it 's just , it 's just making it a habit that 's hard . Oh , I know . Well the kids have even got to the point where they , if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can , you know , they , they 're , oh , no , do n't do that 

and they go to the sink , they rinse them out , and they put them upside down , they let them drain and -- Uh-huh . -- and then , uh , after a couple of days they take them all outside and , I put them in a big bag anyway -- Uh-huh . -- and then they dump the bag out and then they crush them . So that 's -- Uh-huh . -- their activity thing . To go out there and crush . That 's fun . Yeah , yeah , -- So , -- yeah . Oh , that 's a lot of fun . Yeah . That 's a lot of fun . Well , that 's great . Well I 'm to hear you 're , doing that . I , my sister was here recently from Connecticut and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans . Oh really ? .
