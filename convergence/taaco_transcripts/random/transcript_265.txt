Do you have children ? Uh , yes , 

yes , I have a daughter . Do you . Yeah . How old is she ? She 's only about , uh , uh , a little less than two years old . Uh , I guess you have not reached the stage where you need to , uh , promote a college or anything , huh . No . I 've got one that 's seven and one that 's three , 

so , we , uh , we started saving , but that 's all . Yeah . So , do you , is there , are you planning to , like , encourage your children to go to a particular school ? Uh , , no , uh , um , no particular school . Uh , I think that 's really a decision th , that , That you are going to let them make . They , well , help them make in terms of , you know , what they are , they are -- Right . -- wanting to do . Uh-huh . You know , that , that 's a big influence , I think and , Yeah , yeah . You know what , not only what you can afford , but what , what 's going to be best for them -- Right . -- in terms of what their career goals are . Uh-huh . So , uh , you know , you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do . Yeah . Where did you go to school ? Uh , University of Mississippi . Oh . Was that local or , uh , Uh , well , it was , well , it was within the state . 

Uh-huh . But it , it was not necessarily local , it was , Yeah . But I , I mean , so what 's , MUMBLEx , What 's the criterion for choosing to go there ? Yeah . Uh , well , at the time , I was , uh , thinking of going pre med -- Uh-huh . -- and in the state , uh , they had the best pre med uh , curriculum for the , uh , state institutions . Uh-huh . It was choice between there and , uh , a private college -- Uh-huh . -- that , uh , was a bit more expensive . Yeah . At the time , we really could not afford it so -- Yeah . 

-- I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me . It , uh , I enjoyed it . So you , did you commute everyday then or , No . Oh , okay . No , 

no , it was a six hour drive . Oh , okay , when you said it was quite a , quite a way away , I did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour or , MUMBLEx MUMBLEx I was , uh , it was like another world . Uh-huh . Basically , it was a , no it was a , did not get home that often , you know , and at that age -- Yeah . -- it 's , uh , it 's kind of , kind of difficult sometimes . Yeah . Especially , if you have not been away a lot -- Yeah . -- that extended . So , did you go there , like , straight out of high school ? Yeah . Yeah . 

Uh , see I did not get my degree until later on , so I just finished mine a couple of years ago . Uh-huh . And , uh , you know , I guess , you know , when you have to do it that way , it makes , makes your choices a lot easier but , Uh , that 's true . Yeah , that , that 's like , you know , when I went on to get my , my master 's -- Uh-huh . 

-- I , uh , basically was , you know , it was where I was at the time . Right . You know , I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else -- Right , right . -- because I was pretty much settled and I was trying to work . But , uh , so when you are first going to school that , you kind of have the luxury of being able to -- Exactly . -- have some latitude in choosing the place to go . Yeah . Wh , which group do you work in in T I ? Um , uh , the computer science center . Oh , uh , where is that at ? Uh , north building . I see . How long do you work for T I ? Uh , about three years . Did you work somewhere else , like sounds like you got your master 's before here or , Uh , yeah , I have , uh , uh , no actually , I mean I came straight from school to here . I see . So , cause this was the first , first real job after getting my degree . Uh-huh . After your master 's or after your , After my master 's . I see . My undergraduate degree was not in , not in what my master 's was . I see . So I made a career change -- Uh-huh . -- basically . I see . Well , let 's see I , have not MUMBLEx you know , there 's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools , you know , just like you said . Uh , depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford , different things like that , so I , I have not -- Yeah . -- really made up my mind , you know , whether to encourage them to go different places or , One day I would like to , uh , you know , the , uh , I , I like the school where I went . Uh-huh . I mean , and I would not hesitate at all to , to encourage her to go there -- Right . -- there if she wanted to . Right . 

Or the school where I got my master 's at , which , which was a different school . Right . And , uh , I liked it almost as well . Uh-huh . Uh , but , uh , you know , that , I 'm not going to hold them to that -- Right . -- just because I went there . I , you know , think that 's -- Yeah . -- If they want to , that 's fine , but -- Yeah . -- otherwise not . Although I ca- , uh , would get quite a break on , on tuition . Um , because you went there . Yeah , because they , uh , allow for , uh , uh , tuition , uh , break for out of state students -- Um . -- who children of alumnae . I did n't know that . Well certain schools do it . Yeah . This school does . So , uh , Huh . It 's , it MUMBLEx , I , I was involved in some , uh , oh , alumnae recruiting , uh , here in town , uh , recently , uh , well last year . Uh-huh . Uh , and it was kind of fun , because you are trying to to , trying to get people interested in your school , you know . Uh-huh . And they were , this was a college night at a , at a high school in Richardson . And it was , Uh-huh . And there were a bunch of kids , you know , and a bunch of schools . There were a hundred schools , probably there -- Uh-huh . -- all competing for the same kids . Uh-huh . It 's kind of interesting to , to , to talk up , you know , your , Yeah , 

your own school , school And , I was surprised by the number of kids that came , came by and had heard of , you know , our school . Uh-huh . And , and were interested in it . Um . Uh , you know , we , uh , MUMBLEx situations like that , you do n't realize , you know , until you start thinking about it , the kinds of MUMBLEx advantages you school may have over others . Uh-huh . And so , I , I was real , real pleased with that . That worked out so well . Yeah . So did you drum up any interest then I think so . I do n't know offhand but , uh , it seemed like there were quite a few -- Uh-huh . -- kids that were definitely interested in going there . So , there , And that , There was one mother who , uh , came by right , even , before we started , who , who obviously was , uh , very interested in getting her , her daughter in or , or having gotten her daughter in or something and she was wanting some more information . But she was , her , her daughter was , uh , a , a , ma- , ma- , dru- , a majorette or something . Uh-huh . You know , a baton twirler or something -- Uh-huh . -- and she was she was , letting us know she , MUMBLEx how , how good her daughter was . She had cards printed up , actually -- Oh , really . -- describing , you know , business cards describing her daughter 's , uh , you know , she had won several different twirling awards , and all this , Uh-huh . and she was , had these business cards she was passing out and it was quite a production . I think some parents go a little bit overboard . Yeah it sounds like it . Yes . Well you know I think Richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely
