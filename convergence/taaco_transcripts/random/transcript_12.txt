Hi Diana . Hi . Have you all been able to do much as a family these days ? Pardon me . Have you all been able to do much as , uh , as a full family these days , all of you . Oh , yes , we 've , uh , been , um , we 've gone other , you know , all kinds of places , we go out to dinner , Yeah . we take the kids to the park , and , uh , you know , whenever we , he , my husband has time off or something , we take them to the zoo , or we , you know , we do everything we can possibly as a family . Do you work outside the home ? No , I do n't . Yeah , 

I do n't either , it makes it a little bit easier , I think , that way . Yeah , 

it does , an , an then , uh , you know , my husband enjoys spending time with the kids , you know , he 'll , he 'll take them out just to be with them . Yeah . So he , they can have time with him an . So you have a break too . Right , so and we , uh , we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home , you know , we have , we try to spend like Monday nights , we call it family home evening , Uh-huh . and , have our kids , uh , you know , have little lessons with them , and , you know , just see , count , see how things are going in our family and , you know , teach them about their grandparents or something like that . Bring out pictures of them so they get to know them and , we just do all kinds of fun things like that an . Yeah , we have family that 's far away . It sounds like you might too . Yeah , we do , so they , Yeah . you know , the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures . 

And , uh , Right , and phone calls that 's about , about it . Yeah , right and , uh , you know , they , we , you know , we go to the park or we go in the backyard and sit down an , That 's wha , yeah , that 's what we mostly do , pretty simple things . Yeah . Especially since my youngest one is , excuse me , only fourteen months . Right . She , she 's really getting to the age where she 's playing , Uh-huh . and likes to go places . Yeah , and with , you know , me being at home and just having the one income , you know , you do n't have , this lot of extra money to , to do a lot of , you know , extra things . That 's right . So , you , you make more fun than , you know . You know the kids just think it 's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or , Oh that 's a big thrill for them . yeah , or , uh , you know , go get a bag of M and M 's or something like that , they , they think that 's a lot of fun . So we just , we try to spend as much time as we can . We , you know our , our whole weekends are divi- , are devoted to our children except for we might go out , you know , one evening or something , Yeah . but during the day , you know , it 's all devoted to our kids and they come , go to church with us and so . Yeah , that 's true . Yeah , so . Have , um , have you ever been to the Science , it 's called the Science Place ? Yes , yes , that 's what . We ju- , we have n't lived here too long and we went there a couple of weeks ago and , uh , . Uh-huh , the kids thought that was wonderful . Oh , yeah , we , 

I guess there 's Science Place One and Science Place Two . We 've only been in , I think it 's Science Place Two . I , is , I 'm not sure which one we went into , it was about a year or so ago , when we went . The one we went in had , uh , the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that , like a kid 's place area . Uh-huh , yeah . That really seem , they really seemed to go wild in there . Yeah , yeah they had a lot of fun in there and , uh , there 's , uh , there 's some petting , you know , like , uh , uh , I think it 's Owens Country Farms has a free petting , you know , like a farm that you can go to 

and the kids can pet animals and stuff . Where 's that . That 's on Plano Road , uh , it 's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road , it 's like a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road . Uh-huh , uh-huh . And that 's a lot of fun . Oh yeah . They have tours going through there and , uh , the kids think that was a lot of fun , too . Oh , that does sound like fun . It 's a little bit of a ways , We take , you know , whenever we take them to Showbiz or they think it 's wonderful just to go to McDonald 's , you know , they do n't go for the food 

they go for the , to play around and , That 's right . There 's another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business , Uh-huh . and it 's a indoor fun park and it has a bunch of different rides for kids . That 's sounds fun too . 

And parents get in free and it 's like , during the week , it 's like five dollars admission per child , all day . And , and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting , The petting farm , yeah . That sounds fun I think maybe we 'll try to do that . Yeah , yeah and the one in Mesquite is , uh , Scyene exit . Uh-huh . And it 's , it 's , uh , the kids just had a wonderful time there , they , you know , you just pay that admission , and then all the , the , the rides are free . You know , of course , they have all the little video games and , you know , those little quarter rides , you know , to , and stuff like that but , Yeah . they thought that was lot of fun . You can have birthday parties there an , I think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza cause there 's more for them to do . Because they can just do , you do n't have to have tokens for everything . Yeah , right . Yeah . So they had a lot of fun . That does sound like fun . Well I 've gotten some good ideas from you . Yeah . I , we try to do a lot of things as a family and , you know , inexpensively as possible , so . Definitely . Well , I think , I do n't know if we 've done five minutes but I 'm sure that will be good . Yeah , that will be good , yeah . It was good talking to you . Well it was good talking to you . I really appreciate your suggestions . Oh , no problem . Well , take care . Okay , bye-bye , Bye-bye .
