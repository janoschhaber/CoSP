Well , um , I 'm , uh , pretty pro gun control over all . I , uh , I 've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control and , uh , I must say that there are a couple of arguments against , uh , strong gun control which I find very compelling , although most the people who argue gun control with me I find , uh , use sort of canned arguments , you know , sort of the N R A slogan arguments and , um , uh , see I 've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it . Um , I guess on a one , a scale of one of ten I 'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns and I have to admit most of that is , uh , strong personal distaste . I do n't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort . Um , and , uh , guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me . Well , me being from Texas , Uh-huh . I hope you 're ready for this . Um , uh , I 'll give it a try . I 've got my Texan stereotypes in place . Well , I 'm not your stereotypical Texan . I was raised around guns , hunting . Uh-huh . So I do n't have a fear of fire arms in any respect . Uh-huh . I resp , I respect them and what their capabilities are . Uh-huh . And on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military , as a Green Beret , I definitely respect the power of weaponry . Uh-huh . It 's pretty power is n't it ? And here in Houston , as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country , and here , here , here you go , here you , this will be border line N R A which I am not a member of . Okay . Okay . When you , I mean , you 've heard the , the slogan , um , if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns . Uh-huh . That applies to anything as well as guns . MUMBLEx a gun . Well , you , you 've got , well , any of the big cities you 've got the different rival gangs and they 're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such , Uh-huh . And they get out their little Mac tens , they get out their little uzis and they 're going to fight with them . And it does n't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm . If they want it they 'll get it . I do n't care if , if they 've got to go down into New Mexico to get it they 'll get it and they 'll get across the border . Now my position , although , I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon , Uh-huh . anyway . Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony , if I wanted to buy one , I do n't think there should be that big of a restriction on it . If they want to run a background check on me , fine . If they want to put a seven day waiting period , fine , again . Uh-huh . If they want , want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that I 've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county , that 's fine too . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . What I do n't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it 's it would n't , you do n't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way , I would hope . I mean , because I mean someone the personal sheriff does n't like does n't get to have a gun and someone the personal sheriff , Well , MUMBLEx , the only , well , the criteria the sheriff would have to follow has , is this guy a convicted felon ? Uh , is he a habitual trouble maker ? Are we picking him up every Saturday , Yeah . for a drunk and disorderly and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems . 

You know , just proving that you 're a basically a good citizen . But if you 're not a , if you 're not a basically good citizen , you just told me that you 're going to get one of those guns anyway . If , if they want the firepower they can get it . So why hav , because it does n't matter how restrictive your border control points are they 'll get it across the border one way or the other . So why have any restrictions at all ? Uh , okay . Let , go back to that one to ten scale where one , being , full gun control , Uh-huh . ten being none . Yeah . I 'd said about an eight . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , we can could be , I said the restrictions I would like to see on , for anybody , whether it being for handgun , a rifle , a shotgun , I would like to see them go through either , I 'd like to see a law enforcement agency , not N R A , but whether it be the , your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun . You got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon , how to safely handle the weapon , how to properly maintain it , the three basics . Well , that makes a lot of since to me . I mean , I certainly feel that if , if , we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm but , uh , I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do , use it safely as someone learns how to drive , if not more so . Well , the han- , in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon , Yeah . as a , as a pistol . Well , I have a bicycle and that scares me too to tell you the truth because I 've been run off the road and all sorts of things . Well , I 'm still , I 'm still puzzled though , what is the argument , how does the argument work if , uh , if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway . What 's the point of putting a restrictio- , basically , the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway they 're not going to take those courses . Is it , uh , is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns ? Well there 's , If it 's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices does that , uh , mean advantage ? Uh , not necessarily a price thing . What is happening at least in this state and I expect to see it in other states very soon , legislation been introduced as that , if a citizen of the state , being , Uh-huh . myself , has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course , I can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or uncon , unconcealed . Uh-huh . 

Okay . You , you 're , you 're from California , right ? Uh-huh . L A area ? Uh , no . Bay area . San Francisco , Okay . 

Bay area . Okay . You 've been to the city ? 

Uh-huh . And all these people come around , someone attempts to mug me I would ju- , I would , 

as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we 're equally matched because I can meet him blade for blade . Uh-huh . 

Now if this legislation comes through , he pull , I 'm out with my family -- Uh-huh . -- we 've gone shopping , we 're fixing to get in the car , this guy comes up , he pulls a blade on me . I can pull a gun on him now . When you 're , and when you 're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick . What if you 're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon ? Then it 's still equally matched . Having , I , having spent time in combat I feel , Yeah . I feel it before they 'll get the gun on me . Well , If I 'm , I 'm , I 'm sure , MUMBLEx at the same , I 'm sure given all , time . given all your training I 'm sure that , you know , you 'd , 

if I walk into a bad neighborhood I 'm sure I 'd want to walk through with you because I 'm sure you have good , you know , fa- , far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything . Um , I 'm , quite concerned that if you let everyone has n't yet used a gun in a , have n't , has n't yet committed a felony , if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario , you 're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature . You 're going to start getting a lot of gunfire . It 's , it 's hard for me to imagine that a , a situation of , you know , take it to a logical extreme , if everyone walking around carrying a guns you 're not going to have an increase in gunfire . I , actually it 's no- , it 's more of a police action in itself , the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying , well , I 'm going to mug this guy right here but hey , he 's carrying just as much firepower as I can . And if they 're sca , if you got to go through a certification course to get where , to where you can carry it in public , Uh-huh . then this individual also knows this guy 's pretty good with it . Now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not , Uh-huh . that 's another trip , Uh-huh but . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . In defense of myself , defense of my family or defense of my friends I can blow somebody a way in a heart beat . Uh-huh . Even , even more so when it comes to my , my wife and son . Yeah , Anybody , I know , anybody tries to hurt them I wo n't even blink , No . 

I , I understand that . What if , uh , what if you think someone 's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake ? This , this is where the question of gun control comes in . Yeah . Well , uh , that , What , that was the topic . I consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot . Uh-huh . Say a person , uh , uh , get , all of a sudden my combat in me goes up and say I 've got the vibes , this guy 's fixing to do something , I go ahead and pull my piece . Uh-huh . And I make sure this persons sees it so that he 's got now doubt that I will use it on him and I will use it right then . Uh-huh . If he does n't back up at that point he deserves what he gets because I have sent the clearest signal you mess with me , you mess with my family , I 'm going to dust you . As it stands now I 've got to do that with a blade . And the only reason I feel confid , com , com , comfortable doing that is because of the training I 've had . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well as , as someone who would , would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander , I feel more comfortable with people having blades because , uh , you 're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly and , uh , Well , if I 'm the one doing the shooting I do n't miss . That 's the kind of training I 've had . I mean ...
