So , well , this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day , so . Right . Um , well , what do you think is , uh , the pollutants , the main pollutants in the air ? I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that I just , uh , I think they put off so much and they 're not regulated enough . Yeah , well , that 's me too . After , um , on channel thirteen , uh , they had some , some programs the day before , and I 'm not sure that about yesterday , we did n't really watch it too much yesterday , but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and , you know , how we 're affecting the Earth and things by what we do , Uh-huh . as the people and , and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot , Yeah . and that actually , um , as our population increases and , you know , our , of course , our , our cars , you know , our number of cars increase per the population , that 's the problem . But also like you said the industry pollution and , you know , their reg- , their regulation that 's placed on them is , I mean , it 's better than it used to be but it 's incredible that they still do n't have , you know , they do n't , they 're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air . Right . You know , I , I just , I ca n't stand that and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that , you know , they 're supposed to be regulated because we have a , we have a plant , I do n't know about T I but we have a plant , uh , a Pillsbury plant , Uh-huh . in , in a town adjacent to ours , and I know people that work there that , of course , you would n't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals , No . but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the , um , what they do , uh , to , uh , make their dough and st- , to , Really ? clean out the flour and stuff like that , yeah , Huh . 

I mean , it 's incredible . And , um , they said that they 're , you know , they have a little creek that runs by them and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they , you know , shut down everything and they clean up their act , but on a normal basis that they 're , that they 're dumping things , Oh . that they 're not supposed to be dumping , and I 'm like , if they 're getting away with it , Right . can you imagine , that 's a , that 's a Pillsbury plant I ca n't imagine plants , I would n't have thought that Pillsbury could , would , the , I mean , or even had chem- , you know , well , 

those chemicals would not , Yeah , they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff , Yeah . you know to , to break the flours down and then they , they also do testing there , and I do n't , you know , wh , when you consider , you know , it 's probably not radioactive but toxic can be , can be anything that 's cr , uh , classified that can damage the Earth . Right , yeah . So , there could be a lot of things that they could put , you know , that chemical wise that they use to , uh , that they are testing with , Right , you know , like in , that they 're dumping . Yeah . In packaging and , uh , you know , just goodness . Yeah , I do n't think they do the packaging at this plant , Yeah . but they do , they do a lot of research and they do , um , they do , do a lot of the refining up there or , Yeah . I 'm not really , what 's it called when you do flour , I 'm not , Uh , only thing I can think is bleaching but , I mean , I , Yeah . I do n't know what 's , how they do the flour . Yeah . But , um , we , we 're on the southwest side of Houston we do n't have that much as far as , uh , aiming in the plants over on this , uh , the we , east side does . Uh-huh . We 've got Imperial sugar but , uh , and they 're , you know , they 're right there on the creek also and , uh , they 've been there for years . Yeah . And , uh , But , I mean , you think about it , it , you know , it 's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just , I 'm not really sure but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean- , or stream or such , Yeah . or you can , you can , you know , do , uh , testing on the ground itself at that point , Uh-huh . but when they pollute into the air and you 've got , you know , and you 've got movement through the air , it 's going to move a lot of that off . So , I do n't see , you know , how they can do some of the te- , unless it just hangs there like in places where it 's a lot of pollution , you know , like in Los Angeles or , or the bigger cities where it , it tends to get stuck there , Uh-huh . you know , that you have a lot more particles in the air , Right , yeah . you know , per , per , uh , per particles in the surrounding community because it 's not moved away , Uh-huh . but , um , I know that , 

I worry every now and then , we 're still on a well water , we 're not on city water , Uh-huh . 

and I think , well , what if somebody 's dumped something back there in the , and no one knows about it and , you know , it sinked in through the ground and all that , Yeah , well , I know out in some , I 'm not sure , I ca n't remember the name of the county it 's , it 's where Stillwater is or , Yeah . sweet , no 

I 'm not sure , I know it , I think it 's , uh , I know we have a piece property there , it 's called Dublin , Uh-huh . it 's in Dublin , Texas . I 'm not really sure what the county , it 's Stephen , no Stephenville . Oh , okay , okay . Okay , where Stephenville 's at , Uh-huh . 

they 've had a lot of problems because they 've , um , introduced a lot of dairies there , Yeah . so , they have a lot of cattle in the area , I mean , they 've got like per , per , ya- , uh , per lot , you know , they 've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they do n't th- , th- , it 's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free , Right , uh-huh . they 've got to have them there to be able to milk them . And they , and I read in this article , I could n't believe it , where , you know , like , one cow produces , like , a day , produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure . Oh . One cow , 

I was like , my God , and they , and this thing says that , that , you know , it- , people think , well , cow manure is good for fertilizer but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it 's not , it 's not when , you know , you buy cow manure at the store they 've added stuff to it 

and they 've added humus and stuff that , Uh-huh . breaks it down , and , and this , and this article said that they 've got a real problem that , um , you 've got toxins and , and , uh , bacteria in the manure that is , what it 's doing is it 's going through , uh , they do n't have a very deep , um , o- , you know , their water , Uh-huh . their natural water , uh , I forget what that 's called with , you know , it 's like a spring , spring water , Yeah . but it 's below the surface it 's not very far down , Uh-huh . and all this stuff is seeping through to the water , Oh . and they 're like , they 're afraid that , you know , within a certain amount of years , that it 's , their wa- , their water in that town will be totally polluted , It will . and they wo n't be able to have any drinking water because they will have , um , polluted , completely polluted , so that they 're , you know , there 's too many toxins and bacterial growth , Uh-huh , yeah , and the gr- , and I 'm like my God , you know , Right . just from that one , you know , just from them introducing dairy farms , Right . in that one county . Yeah , and the , the ground will filter some of it but not all of it . No , not when you figure , I did n't realize a cow , one cow produces that much manure and they were talking like , These are well fed . thousands of cows , you know , These are , they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area . You , Good grief , these are well fed cows , uh , , Well , they are evidently . But , um , I mean , ev- , evidently a normal cow produces that much too , Uh-huh . but they 're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it 's not , you know , a problem , Right . but when they get them in these tiny little areas , you know , and they 've got a real big problem , and they , they said that , that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff , and taking it to , Uh-huh . uh , these like ponds that they had to filter it with , but the ponds because they 've had so much rain in the past few years , they just , Yeah . overflow 

and they overflow into the , the creeks and stuff in the area . So , that just creates , you know , there , there 's , and , oh , it was just disgusting it said the creeks will foam . Oh . People , people stand outside their houses and their , watch the creeks foam brown and all , Oh , now that 's bad . and I 'm just like , oh , my gosh , and the smell is really bad they sa- , Oh , , I was going to say , the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad . Yeah , but I , I do n't know it really frightens me though as far as the , when you think about the , you know , thinking of just air pollution itself and then , and , channel thirteen they 're really , um , emphasizing the problem with acid rain , you know , Uh-huh . if we , if we keep putting that stuff into the air and , and , you know , if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it 's really going to be a problem for , um , just the , the Earth , you know , what the Earth is receiving back , you know , Yeah . because how can you tell where it 's going to come down at . Right , right . And then cutting the trees , you know , that bothers me . Yeah . As far as , you know the The rain forest and all . yes , uh , we 've been wanting to , well , not me but , uh , it 's been recommend , or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here , I 'm like , no , you know , MUMBLEx for what 's cut down here , you know , more will be cut down someplace else and it will just take that longer to grow back , Yeah . and trees help so that , uh , , I do n't , Well , they do because , what is it , carbon dioxide , Uh-huh . they use that where we ca n't synthesize it and they 're synthesizing it for us . Right , 

right , believe me it 's just so much better . Yeah . So , uh , yeah , I knew , I think there 's lots that be , that could be done to , to improve how things are done now . Yeah , I think we just have to , I do n't know personally , you know , I suppose , you know , if you just make sure your car is , 

Uh-huh . is working properly and yo- , you know , they 're suppos , nowadays they have the emission controls on them but , uh , I think the only , the main thing is just keep on the , legis- , your legislator 's back , you know , as far as , seems like they 've only just really started as far as the environment saying , Uh-huh . okay , we 're really going to get involved it , it 's really becoming a problem . By the year two thousand there will , what , what are we going to have , what kind of results are we going to have for the environment . Right . And , and what will we ...
