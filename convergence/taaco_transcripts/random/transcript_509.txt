Hello . MUMBLEx I pressed the button one , so we 're recording right now . I 'm sorry . 

That 's okay . I 'm Bill from Raleigh . Okay , 

and I 'm Melanie from Harrisville , Utah . Oh , another one from a different state besides Texas . Yeah . Um , okay , Bill , we 're talking about family reunions . Right . Okay , um , have you ever had to plan a family reunion ? Uh , yes and no , it was n't really a fa- , a planning one , but it was kind of , uh , it was a birthday -- Oh . -- and I brought a lot of family together then . Uh-huh . And how did you feel it went ? It went pretty good . I 'm , I 've worked in hotels , so I , I kind of know how to do these things . Oh . I used to , you know . All this planning and , and getting together and such . Um , oh , let 's see what else . Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it 's my grandmother 's birthday , and -- Uh-huh . -- and it 's all of like , she , she comes from a big family . She has like seven sisters I think . Oh , boy . They show up and all their kids . And then all , she has , uh , I have like , uh , let 's see , she has four sons and two daughters , and -- Uh-huh . -- they show up and all their kids , 

so it 's a pretty big reunion , it 's about two hundred people , maybe . Oh , my word . Well , what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together ? Um , the , probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone , you know , could eat comfortably and , and everything , uh . Uh-huh . I guess probably the most helpful thing was that , um , for the rent , we rented like a , a rescue squad building or something -- Oh . -- like that . Uh-huh . And , uh , each one of the , everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for , for like soft drinks and -- Oh . -- and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill . Oh , that 's good . And each person in the family , you know , brought a dish , or something . Uh-huh , and then did you have a main meal , 

or did everyone just bring , it was just pot luck . It was kind of pot luck . Uh-huh . You know , everybody brought their specialties , I guess you would say . Yeah , yeah , show off a little bit . Yeah . And of course my grandmother 's food was , as always , gone first -- Oh . -- because she 's such a great cook . Oh . Now how old is she ? Uh , she 's eighty-six . Oh , goodness . Is she pretty spry , is she , you know , pretty . Now she does , she looks probably like she 's in her early sixties -- Oh , wow . -- and if she did n't have arthritis , she 'd get around better -- Uh-huh . -- than me as a matter of fact . Oh . Oh , that 's neat , that she 's in good health , and that , at that age . Yeah . 

Oh , yeah . My nickname for her is Honey Woman . That 's what I call her . Really . Well that sounds fun . Well , I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago , and there were , we sent out five hundred , uh , announcements , because our family is quite large , like your , your family there . And so that was a real challenge , and I was president of our family reunion for two years , and I was n't very MUMBLEx at that duty , for two years in a row , but I found that advance planning was the key to success . Uh , also one thing that 's helpful , and I do n't know if your family 's spread out or whatever -- Uh-huh . -- but most of , all my family lives like in the same county so , Oh , that 's wonderful , though . But it 's just kind of like get on the telephone and , it 's so and such days from such and such date -- Oh . -- and everybody just shows up . Oh , well , that is , that is helpful . Yeah , our family ranges from , oh , goodness , well , Australia , I have a brother lives in Australia , to , uh , Boise , Idaho , and , and , uh , all kinds of places . I would say you 're spread out , then . 

We are . Uh , my immediate family , you know , my , my parents and my brothers and sisters , I guess we 're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever , because my dad was in the Army and we 're -- Oh . -- we 're pretty strung out all over . But since they 've moved back to Carolinas , we still are the only ones do not live in -- In . -- in Yantsen County . Oh . I live in Raleigh , and then my , my parents live in Greenville , and I have one brother and his wife -- Uh-huh . -- live in Greenville , and , uh , another brother that lives in , outside of Fayetteville . So I mean , we 're , we 're spread out , but -- Boy . -- everybody else is centralized in , in , my home town , Waynesboro so . Oh , my gosh . Nobody moves away except us . They must really like it there . Yeah , I got out as soon as I graduated . Yeah . Oh . Just like this town is too small for me , Good-bye . Oh , you 're ready to move on to bi- ,
