Okay . So how serious is the , subject of crime in your area ? Well , needless to say , here in Washington , D C this is the war zone . Uh , D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital . It 's , uh , it 's really bad here . Uh , for example , the , uh , local high school , uh , they 've already found two students with sawed off shotguns -- Jeez . -- and they 're starting to , uh , get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school , of all things . So , Well , luckily , it has n't gotten that bad here . Uh-huh . Uh , San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime . Uh-huh . Uh , but it 's on the uprise , especially in a lot of the , uh , outlying agricultural towns . 

Uh-huh . Uh , because you end up having a lot of gangs forming , uh , largely around the Hispanic core . Uh-huh . Uh , it seems to be that , uh , gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions . Uh-huh , right . That 's how they , uh , they bind themselves together in groups , I guess and , uh , 

Yeah . Now , the , interestingly enough , I do n't think we have here , a , a lot of gangs , but , uh , only a couple , uh -- Uh-huh . -- of , not a whole large group of them , but , uh , just a few . Most of them centered around , uh , drug territory . Uh-huh . And so they 're protecting their economic interests , I guess . Yeah . And , uh , nowadays the latest thing I 've , I 've read about in the paper here that they 're doing as far as , uh , crimes involving stealing cars is that , instead of stealing , uh , cars like at night , breaking into them or whatever , they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up , and then as you get out of the car , they just , uh , step up and , uh , take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house . Well , that 's efficient . Yeah , that 's the , uh , latest thing . That way there 's no damage to the car or anything . They just wait for you to show up after they 've picked out which one they want . They 're decided they 're completely unworried about being identified or anything -- Uh-huh . -- of that sort . Right . Just wait for you to drive to your house , you get out and they get in , off they go with your car . Wow . So it 's , uh , I think they call it car jacking around here . Yeah , yeah , I 'd heard that phrase . Uh-huh , yeah , that 's kind of the latest thing , but , every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides , so it 's , uh , it 's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we 're not from around here , we 're from , uh , I 'm from Ohio and my wife 's from Florida so , Uh-huh . And we 've just come from twenty years in the military and , uh , which is an entirely different environment , so this is a whole new thing for , for us to , to have to put up with and it 's , uh , really scary sometimes . Yeah , there are n't that many , places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays . Right . And it 's pretty bad when they 're using metal detectors in school -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , of course , the mayor , uh , of D C is having a real problem , uh , trying to , what do you do to , to reduce crime in a , in a major city like D C where it 's a way of life for everybody . It 's , uh , I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem . I do n't know what , what the solution is . Uh , there 's no way they can stop the drugs , and that 's what 's causing all the killing . 

Well , uh , there 's a couple of things that I 've heard , uh , most of them are fairly , uh , radical in terms -- Uh-huh . -- of what you 'd have to do . Uh-huh . Uh , course the , the reason that , that these kids tend to , to turn toward the drugs and everything else s , seems to be just , you know , the , the , the end results of , of poverty and , and -- Uh-huh . -- parents that are n't doing any parenting and everything else because , I mean , you know , the parents are n't making a living at anything . 

Right . Uh , 

And they see all their friends and neighbors , uh , And they 're accidental parents half the time anyway . Yeah , and their friends are driving Mercedes and , so it 's actually , they grow up with that as their way of life and , uh , I think , uh , to a large extent , they do n't understand the concept that what they 're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised . It 's illegal , but it 's not wrong because all their friends do it . Right exactly , so maybe it 's the law that wrong in their eyes and they -- Yeah . -- they say , well , it 's , it 's the law that 's , uh , got to be changed instead of their way of life , so , I do n't know , it 's , I 'm glad it 's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it 's not -- Well -- -- easy . -- I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of , of an actual solution to the problem . Uh -- Uh-huh . -- the , the social , the other social problems would n't , would n't go away . Right . Uh , They 've always been with us . I mean , there 's , there 's been a lot of , uh , and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus , but then , the -- Uh-huh . -- more I thought about it , the more sense it made , is that , uh , alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else . Uh-huh . Uh , and prohibition did n't stop it and did n't do anything really -- Right . -- to slow ,
