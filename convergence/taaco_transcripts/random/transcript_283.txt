So do you have P C -s ? I have a personal computer at home . It 's an A T compatible . I do n't use it very much any more . I used to use it quite a bit . Uh-huh . I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal . I do some P C stand alone work on it , and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame . Uh-huh . What about you ? Do you own a computer ? Um , well I sort of own a computer . We have two P C -s at home , 

but neither one do we really own . Um . 

Are you leasing them ? No , both of them are sort of work related , and , Loaners from work ? Yeah , that 's the nicer way , right . Do you work for T I ? No , no . Um , I , actually I 'm doing consulting right now because I just had a baby , and my husband 's working at Bell Labs , but he 's really from France , and these computers actually are from France . What brand are they ? One of them 's a Compaq -- Uh-huh . -- it 's a three eighty-six -- I 'm jealous . -- and the other is actually a I B M P C compatible , it 's a three eighty-six , I guess it 's twenty-five , yeah , three eight six twenty-five C maybe I do n't know , no we do n't have the MUMBLEx , MUMBLEx we decided not to get the MUMBLEx which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing , and , What kind of consulting do you do ? Um , well , I actually do some work , working at M I T and at NIST , National Institute of Standards and Technology -- Uh-huh . -- in Washington , and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while . What kind of work do you do when you 're consulting ? Um , well , it depends , it 's very different in the different places , but , Is it programming related ? Yeah , yeah . Program related , research related , and I work in the speech field , and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and -- Uh-huh . -- looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech , and I do that type of stuff typically for other people , and we , like here we use the P C -s to do that . Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that . Word processing . Well , more , uh , do you know Latek ? No I 'm -- 

Wo- , -- not familiar with that . Word text processing , so I do n't , I do n't use , I mean , you can call it word processing , but I do n't usually use a word processor to do it -- Uh-huh -- and we do n't have too much standard software . Like I have n't bought , we have n't really bought any commercially available software at all . So we do n't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that . We use it more for just writing programs when we need to or , um , doing research , looking at the speech signal and then doing writing , and also as a just as a terminal , and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that . So , you 've got , you 've got a modem in it then . Uh , neither one has a modem , 

but we have a modem . At home -- Neither one , -- you have a modem that you can connect to each of them ? Right . Uh , and so it 's an external modem . Yeah , we have MUMBLEx . I got , when I got mine I had an internal modem in it -- Uh-huh . -- I used it , uh , quite a bit when I was , uh , uh , looking at , uh , information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in a , in Fort Worth -- 

Uh-huh . -- but , uh , went out of town for a while , and , and sort of got off the , uh , bulletin board and off of my micro completely -- Uh-huh . -- and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without , uh , even without using it on the computer , I could turn a computer on , it 'd start squawking . So I finally opened up the box and took it out . So that was it . I think that 's the thirty second warning . Oh , I did n't hear it . Do you hear , the , the beep in the background . Yes . 

Oh , that 's a , an ambulance or something going on here , I think . Okay . Where , I have n't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually . Where are you , and , uh , In Manhattan . Are you at home now ? Yeah , I 'm at home . So you 've got a lot of traffic noise real close . Uh-huh . So it 'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal I mean , because there 's a lot of background noise that , you know , people can hear . So it 'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up . Um , yeah , and often times that , I ca n't talk on th- , ca n't do this much later than now , between sort of like six , five thirty and six thirty or something like that , because the traffic outside , they honk the horn so loud I ca n't even hear the phone call . What time is it now where you are ? Uh , about twenty after four . So you 're an hour ahead of where I am . I 'm in Central -- Okay , yeah -- -- Central time zone . -- we 're Eastern . And , um , what did , did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems ? No , I have n't done that . Uh , I know someone who has , and , and she 's , uh , very , uh , pleased with it . She told me some of the things you can do , and it 's just a , a very handy tool to have . Uh-huh . Yeah , and you can do a l- , it makes things very convenient . You can save a lot of money , too . Certainly cut down on long distance charges if you , if that 's what you have in mind . Uh-huh , yeah , I 've never tried using that , I do n't know too much about it . What about , have you , did you use commercially available software or , I have , I have used Lotus . I have used , uh , Word Perfect -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I , not heavy use . I 've used , uh , D Base and , uh , I 've used a substantial amount of shareware . Um , I have n't done much Lotus work connected with my job . I 've been through three classes -- Uh-huh . -- and I have a great deal of respect for it . Uh-huh . Um , I have n't done much word processing work with my job . I do some -- Uh-huh . -- and I , and the D Base work I 've done was strictly class related . I 've never used D Base , um , but I 've heard both good things and bad things about it . Well , it 's probably the granddaddy of most , uh , data base management systems . Uh-huh . It 's got some pretty strong competitors . Some of them have reviews that are better than D Base , so , I , I think by now , it 's a matter of , uh , personal taste . Yeah , people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use . I can understand that very easily . I 've used , I 've had a class on , um , R Base and also in Paradox -- Uh-huh . -- and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base . Uh-huh . Do you think you D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more . Or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days ? Um , I would n't say compatible , but -- But , uh -- -- certainly comparable . -- yeah , I did n't mean compatible , I meant comparable . My brain is going to mush . Uh-huh . And what do you work on at T I ? I 'm a computer programmer -- Uh-huh . -- on the I B M main frames . 

Uh-huh . I do , uh , main- , mainly business data processing . Uh-huh . I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility . Uh-huh . Um , sometimes I get called late at night at home because there 's a production problem , and that gives me the opportunity to , uh , come in to work and fix it , if I ca n't think of -- 

 -- some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we 're on the phone . Right . Um , I also , uh , handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected ,
