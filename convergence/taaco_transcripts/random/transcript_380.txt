Um , tell me some about your camping experiences , Carolyn . Well , um , I have gone to girl 's camp a few times , as a , you know , a chaperon or a leader , whatever -- 

Okay . -- and , uh , I enjoy camping . I , we ha , we have a tent , and we 've gone , even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove , um , I guess our , our , my biggest memory is when we froze to death .  We just did n't take enough blankets and -- Wh- , -- 

-- whatever . -- where do you go camping at around here ? Uh , we went camping at , uh , Lake Bonham , which is , is pretty close here . Um , we went fairly early in the season for this area , which is probably April -- Okay . -- is when we went , and , and it got really cold at night , and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things -- Sure . -- in the morning , but , Uh , what , uh , what activities do you do when you 're camping ? Oh , we take little nature hikes and , and , uh , we take along games that we can play with the , with the kids , and just that kind of stuff . Usually try to have a , uh , occasionally a camp fire at night , you know , and -- Uh-huh . -- roast the marshmallows and what all . Well , that sounds like fun . I , uh , I grew up in South Dakota , up in the Black Hills -- Oh . -- and so we used to go camping , my dad would take us , there was , there was four of us kids , we 'd , he 'd take us , and we 'd all go camping , my dad and my mom and , and the kids , and it was always fun , uh , because what I always remember is , my dad would let us pick our camp spot and , uh , he 'd always tell us , you know , okay , look for , you know , a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents , and it always had to be somewhere near a , a river so we could go fishing , and hopefully we 'd catch our supper , but we never did -- Um . -- but it was , it was always fun . We 'd always , Mom was always prepared and she 'd bring along , you know , something , because tradition had it we would never catch anything , so we always had , 

 something along to eat , but then we 'd roast , roast marshmallows , and it , it was always an enjoyable experience . Uh , about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills , I crossed the state to , to Aberdeen , and , uh , there 's no hills , it 's flat , and then I was in high school , and , uh , couple of friends , couple of my high school friends and I , we 'd go camping out by a river , of course , and , and go fishing , but by then , of course , I was able to catch , uh , catch some things , but , it , it was always fun . It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river -- Uh-huh . -- you know , in the hills we , we would do like you di , you folks did , you folks did , would take the nature hikes and , you know , and look for animals , and we always , you know , in the hills , you can see quite a few different animals , but , Uh , Go ahead . We used to live in Utah -- Okay . -- and , uh , of course , there 's lots of mountains around there to camp in , and , and streams and stuff . That 's , that 's a great place to go camping , and the hiking is just really great . You know , hike up those mountains -- Sure . -- is just really fantastic . Um . Now is there anything , uh , are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area . I 'm not acquainted with any , you know , I , there 's woods and things out in East Texas -- Okay . -- Tyler area , you know , there 's a Tyler State Park that 's , uh , really a nice camping area , but it , it 's just a lot of trees , it 's not , I do n't know of any place in Texas that has , uh , really big , you know , what I call mountains . Uh-huh . I , The Rocky Mountains are so much , uh ,  bigger than anything that they 've -- Right . -- they 've got down here that , Is the one in Tyler , has it been pretty commercialized , I suppose ? No , it 's not , well , it 's not too bad . They have , um , screened in areas , you know , they 're not really cabins , I would n't say , I guess they could call them that , but they 're , they 're more just a screened in , uh , camping area -- Okay . -- whatever , they 're , they 're not bad . Helps , helps keep the , the pests out , I suppose . Yeah , yeah . Well , that sounds , I do n't know if I can rate camping , 

but , you know , it sure beats driving a thousand miles , to , to find a mountain , I guess . Yeah , that 's right . I , I take it you have n't done a whole lot of camping in this area . No , we just moved down in , in June . Oh , I see . Well , you 're still , uh , get- , you 're just trying to get over the culture shock still . Yeah , I 'm still trying to find my way around . I , if I -- Yeah . -- can get on Central from anywhere , I 'm happy . Yeah , well , really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring , and , in , in the fall . Okay . It just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly , I mean , there 's , there 's a lot ,
