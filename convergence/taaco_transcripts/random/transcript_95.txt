Well , what d , do you think in terms of , uh , benefits ? Well , personally , you know , I think , you know , of course I 'm sure we 're familiar with the exact same benefit package and I think that , uh , we 've probably got one of the best around , you know , besides , they tend to offer ad , adequate vacation , I guess . And the paid time off is wonderful , and , uh , one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered and I think that is just a , a fabulous one , so . I do n't know if you participate in that or not , but -- Absolutely . -- is n't it great ? It 's just a , it 's just a miracle that how fast that adds up , you know . Well , I have to agree with that . You know , I was thinking about , uh , importance of benefits and that kind of thing , other than salary -- Uh-huh -- while I was waiting for , uh , the system to find a , a respondent . Uh-huh . And I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and I suspect that that 's probably true for everyone . Yeah . When I was much younger it was , uh , less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits . But as I grow older and my family grows , it , the medical benefits are more important and the retirement is more important . I had never really thought of it that way but I guess that 's true , I guess that 's true . I 'm still young enough that , that , uh , the vacation 's real important to me and the paid time off is real important to me and , and that kind of thing . But , uh , you know , I was just , as a matter of fact , I just , uh , celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and , uh , kind of started looking through the , the book because of that , you know , now that I 'm a hundred percent vested , you know , you kind of look through the book and see well , what exactly , what does that mean and what is the pension all about and , you know , when you 're , when you 're , you know , in your , I 'm only in my late twenties now , so you tend not to think about retirement . But , uh , it 's , I guess now is the time to think about it , so . Does T I have a pretty good retirement package , do you think ? I think they have , uh , a- , one that we need to recognize that we 're going to have to supplement ourselves . 

Yeah . And that 's certainly one of the reasons that I 'm sure that they 've begun the , uh , CODA Plan . Uh-huh . It 's -- Uh-huh . -- certainly a , a supplemental way , uh , and I suppose if , b- , maybe in , in your instance , if , if you 're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties , and happen to stay with them until you 're sixty-five , then you 'll have a very good retirement plan . Right . 

But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later . Uh-huh . So it 's not , uh , all by itself it wo n't be adequate for , It 's not going to build up , for my situation . quite enough , yeah . So , I have to find a way to supplement that . Yeah . 

Well , they just , they seem to make it so easy to save . You know , one of the things that we 're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world , but I 've got money coming out MUMBLEx to buy savings bonds , just coming straight out of my check . And it 's probably not a great investment , but if I was n't doing that the money would n't be being saved anyway , you know . I kind of have to trade off , you know . If you never see it you do n't spend it , so . And it 's , I unders , understand though , it , Yeah . Uh , believe me , I do that myself . Do you ? Yeah ? And I disagree with you . I do n't think it 's the worst investment , Do you really not ? in the world . I , I , fr- , you know , I , I debate about whether it 's really good or not , you know . Well , it 's , in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you do n't start looking for that word guaranteed , Yeah . until later . Yeah . Uh , it 's shown a history that , uh , sure beats anything else . Yeah , that 's true . That 's very true . Over many , many years . We went , uh , and did a , a thing through I B S which is a , like a financial consultant type thing here in Dallas and , uh , one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was , you know , they work up this whole big , you know , proposal , profile for you , that , ev- , all the things that you need to work on and you need to do . And then one of the things that we talked about with her was , you know , the need to save for our son 's education . We have a two year old , you know , and , and , you know , we ca n't start saving for college when he 's sixteen , you know , we have to do that now . And , and uh , they have a way that they can figure , you know , what , you know , and he 's two now , in sixteen years when he 's ready to go to college , this is how much it 'll cost , you know , and it 's just really scary the thought of how much it 's going to , 

it 's , what it costs now is ridiculous , what it 's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary . And they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a , oh , you know , six percent interest rate , to be able to have , you know , money for his college . 

And that 's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds , is , is , you know , about fifteen hundred dollars a year . So , I guess it , you know , in that way , at least we know that that 's taken care of , you know . We , we can worry about other things so , I understand , Yeah . that approach . That 's , Yeah , what , that 's exactly what 's happening in my family . 

Is it really ? Yeah . Un- , except that mine are a little bit older and , and I 've shown them the numbers and said this is what 's going to be available , all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you 're there . Uh-huh . You better make sure that you 've got a scholarship . That 's right . That 's right . Well , that 's what she said to us . 

She said , now , do you all want him to go to a , a state college or a private college ? And , and our answer was , that , you know , we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college . And if he wants to go to a private college , he can get a scholarship to attend , you know . And that was kind of our view on it . It just costs too much , you just ca n't do it , you know . So , I do n't know , it 's , it 's , I do n't , uh , it just amazing , it amazes me how much the , the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years . I just do n't know how anybody 's going to do it . And boy , it gets really scary when you start talking to them . Uh , I have a , an eleven year old daughter now who 's saying , gee , Dad , I want to be an allergist , Oh , goodness . and I said , that 's wonderful . I applaud that . Let , Yeah . me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that . Yeah . Exactly . And , Exactly . then her little brother 's only two years behind and he says , well , I do n't know , I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian . And I said , that 's great . Let me explain to you how you get scholarships , That 's right , to do that . That 's right . Well , you know , T I , you know , T I offers some good stuff and then I think there 's , I mean I think there 's some negatives , but there 's going to be some negatives anywhere , you know , no matter where you go . I have , you know , all , this is the first really large company I 've worked for . I 've always been involved in little small , you know , ind- , privately owned s- , owned firms and so I 've never had the , the big benefit package . So , I really do n't know how to compare it to other big companies , you know . It , when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what , what they offered . So , I 've been real pleased . Well , that 's fantastic , Yeah . and on whole o- , I would say that they 're equal to , uh , most of our competitors . Think so ? Uh , I can see some , some potential changes that probably are , are , would not cost very much but might , uh , make things a little easier . Uh-huh . Such as offering a , a smorgasbord . Having a larger variety of benefits but , Yeah . but here 's the amount , that , that T I is going to pay for it , Yeah , and you can pick what you want and , yeah . now it 's up to you it 's menu selection , so , Right . to speak . That sounds really good . I read a thing , I do n't even remember if it was in the DALLASITE or the INSITE one , about uh , companies allowing you , and they said that T I was looking into it , to purchase extra vacation days . Which I thought sounded like a good idea . You know , if you 've been there , you know , under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that 's really not enough and you want an extra week , then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying , okay , I 'm going to want an extra five days this year and they 'll take a set amount out of each paycheck , you know , and they 're deducting it all along , so you , you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time , you know , you 're really not being paid for them , the money is actually coming out of your own pocket , but it 's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once , you know . So , that is kind of an idea that , that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and T I said that they were looking into something like that so , Well , I could certainly , personally stand seeing them go to a , a standardized compensatory time -- Uh-huh . -- for overtime . Uh-huh . And I do n't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days , Well , if they did , true . that . True . Uh , and , and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one or , or , you know , maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one . Uh-huh . Uh , a- , as a repayment for , Yeah . every three to five days that I work overtime there , Yeah . they should give me one day . Yeah . 

But it should be a standard and , and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate t , uh , that 's running in each department . Uh-huh . Well , and , yeah , and , and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person and , you know , I see a lot of differences , but , from one group to the next , you know , about who gets it and who does n't get it , you know . But that 's , and that 's that way with a lot of things , you know , there . It seems like , it depends on what , what group you happen to be in , what , what you 're going to get and what you 're not going to get so , Well , that 's for sure . Which is the same , but , but then it 's probably that way anywhere , you know , that 's , Oh , I 'm sure personalities always come into play . Uh-huh . Uh , just in this size of organization ,
