Hello . Hello . My name is Nola . 

I 'm in Plano , Texas . Hi Nola , I 'm Steve . I 'm in Dallas , Texas . Not too far away . No , that 's unusual . Seems like usually , I 've had some from Plano , too . Oh yeah . I think all mine have been East Coast people so far . Uh-huh . Okay -- So , -- um , let 's see . S , social changes , Social changes . what 's that mean ? . That sounds like not as recent social changes , too , like back to the sixties or fifties , I guess . Yeah . Think we can handle that ? Yeah . Yeah , I definitely , I mean there 's plenty of things to talk about there . That 's a , Okay , uh , shall I go ahead and push one ? 

Yeah , sure . Okay . You want to go ahead and start ? . Uh , I was hoping that you would but , oh , 

Oh . In social changes is that , uh , it seems to me that , uh , That involves -- Does that , -- a lot of different -- Y- , -- areas , I think . Yeah . Like a lot , it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer , is even more , 

true today . You know ? Yeah , there is a -- S- , -- a big difference in the , uh , economic , um , status of , uh , people although I think that has been true , uh , always . Um , perhaps there 's less of the middle range then there was . Yeah . It 's like people are starting to give up hope and they start out very poor . Let 's see , that 's a bad tangent to get on . What else has changed between the sixties and the eighties -- Uh , -- and the nineties ? No . I think , uh , m- , in my situation , I have three children and we 're , uh , home schooling . So , education , you know , things that relate t- , to education , um , are things that I think about a lot . Um , I think that , and I think that involves social changes a lot . Uh , for instance , I think the schools are having more and more problems because of , uh , things that are happening socially in the world around them and in , in , t- , because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home , rather . More not than are . And children being put in day-care centers from very early , and , and I think that a lot of these things that have been happening , such as the day-care centers and things , are having a big effect on the social changes . Because of the way children are being raised , they 're not learning the values they need to learn . Yeah . And they 're not , um , th- , they do n't have the self-esteem that they need to have and they do n't have the , um , a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and deal with the things in the world . And , uh , I think we 're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang , gang things that are happening and , and , um , Yeah . It seems , so that , yeah , that is a pretty big change . It seems , even not just single parent families but with no guidance but it seems like , some of these even ladies that , that 'll work and have , Yeah . a baby and then , you know , after two or three months , go back to work . Yeah . Oh it 's , You know , well that , that , I mean that 's very , young for a baby . That 's really sad . I think that a lot of people , and they think they have to but , Yeah . I , I think that if they really tried , they would n't have to . And , Yeah . I , I think that if they did n't that , and it became more of the standard not to that , uh , I do n't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home . You -- Yeah . -- know ? And have a more solid , uh , foundation for the kids . Yeah . I mean they 're going to , like you said , I mean , there 's , they might be saving money , I mean even if they had to pay more now , I mean in the long run it 's going to cost society more to -- 

That 's right . -- force two people to work . Even though -- It 's already , -- it 's higher productivity is short-term . It already costs society much more because of it . You know it , trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those . You would n't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them , you know . Yeah . Um , there 's , and I think , uh , a lot of it is selfishness . People have become very selfish . They do n't want to stay home with the kids -- Y- , yeah . -- or something like that . There are a lot of two parent , um , situations where the woman goes back to work because that 's what she wants to do , you know . Oh rather than she needs the money -- Rather than that , -- just she wants the -- she has to have the money particularly . -- stimulating environment . Or , maybe there 's a small need for money so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself , too . Huh . It , You know , Yeah . It 's interesting how , w- , uh , home study . Is that what you said ? Home school . Home school . Yeah . Is that , uh , is , is it like , uh , a preschool level then or through -- No . -- grade school or , I , I have , uh , one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler . Oh I s- , And one on the way . Oh , well you sound busy . So you 're teaching them , Yes . completely , Yes . Huh . And I think , uh , it 's becoming , uh , more popular then it has been for a while , I think . Home schooling 's always been around but , uh , I can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools . Um , and a lot of it is discipline problems . Yeah . A lot of it is , and you can tell which kids have been in day-care centers . It , it 's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things . Yeah . That , um , they 've been raised in a day-care center . Yeah . That 's pretty sad because , I mean , I do n't know , something 's got to change with the schools . That 's what it all boils down to in the end , usually anyway . Well , I think it 's going to , When they 're young , change in the homes before anything -- Yeah . -- changes anywhere else . The home is the base , it 's the basic unit . And that 's the , where it all starts 

and if we do n't start making changes in the homes and maybe part of that is educating parents better . Yeah . And educating , uh , you know , Changing people 's expectations . I know they do do some , they do have some classes in , um , high schools and things for kids to , uh , give them an idea of what family life is like and the , uh , you know , and , uh , that kind of thing but , uh ,
