Hello . Hi . Hi . My name is , uh , Donna Donahue , and I live in Plano , Texas . Hi . My name is Lowell , 

and I live in Raleigh , North Carolina . Oh , okay . Um , do you want to start or should I start ? Go right ahead . Okay , um , I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in . We have , um , three children , and , um , they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports , soccer and baseball and , well , my little girl goes to tap dance , and my little one goes to preschool and , um , I 'm home with the children , just do a lot of running around . It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type , I do n't know , life . Um , what about you ? . I 'm , I 'm single , and I , I live in a town home -- Uh-huh . -- here in Raleigh , and -- Uh-huh . -- it 's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area -- Okay . -- ther- , we , we have a lot of town homes here -- Uh-huh . -- as well as single family homes , and at the time that I bought this one it was just a , a much better arrangement for me personally . I 'm not home a lot . I travel a great deal with -- Uh-huh . -- my job , and so it was easier to have a home that did n't -- Was sort of maintenance free . -- exactly -- Yeah . -- that somebody else looks out for the maintenance . Oh yeah , well , um , that , that sounds , that sounds pretty good for I know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends , not so much now , but to , um , maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds , and it 's a lot of work , owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it . It 's -- It certainly is . -- sometimes I think , um , it would be nice to have a town home , with not having all that responsibility . 

Well , if you ever get one , be sure the walls are good and thick because if they 're not you can hear . I , that 's the main thing when I was shopping for one , I wanted to make sure I could , I could n't hear my neighbors and that was -- Right . -- so I bought one that 's more like living in a , once you 're inside , you do n't know you 're in a town home . Oh , that sounds lovely . It is . They 're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of like side by side -- Uh-huh . -- so you do n't actually hear anybody next door to you . Uh-huh . So in , in your area then there 's probably a lot of , um , career type people that have those type homes and -- Yes , definitely . -- uh-huh , and , um , the area that we 're settled in is , um , definitely young , young families with , with kids . They 're still doing , um , a lot of building in the neighborhood . So the people that move here seem to move from all over the country , which we 're from , um , the northeast , and , um , seems like a people just do n't , or also do n't have any family around . So it , um , also gives you a common bond when you do n't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors , and you know , um . But , um MUMBLEx , Well , we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees -- Uh-huh . -- people who do n't want the heat of Florida but do n't want the heat of the , the cold of the northeast 

so -- Right , right . -- they settle sort of in-between . Uh-huh . Now it 's , um , is it very wooded around where you are , there lots of pretty trees and , Yes -- Yeah . -- as a matter of fact this is a , uh , this particular community that I live in is very wooded . Oh , how pretty . It is nice . I do miss that . Around here in Plano there are very few trees 

and it 's pretty flat and , and kind of barren and that 's the only thing that we do n't like about living in Texas , is we miss all the beautiful trees and the Fall and , and , um , uh , the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is , you know , in the north . Um , or even where you are . Uh , we definitely have a lot of trees here . 

A lot of leaves to rake up too , I bet . Yes but fortunately the home owner 's association does all that . Does that , well , see , that 's another plus . Yes , I do n't have to worry about that and this is the time of year we 're starting to lose , they 're all falling now . That 's right , that 's right , they are . I 'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done . We just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but , not , not much . Just , just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks and if you did n't do anything about it , then they 'd probably the leaves just blow away . Right . It 's not too bad . Okay , do we have to speak for a certain amount of time ? No , I do n't think so . Okay . Okay . It was really nice speaking to you . It was good to speak with you too . Okay , and have a happy Thanksgiving . Thank you , you too . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
