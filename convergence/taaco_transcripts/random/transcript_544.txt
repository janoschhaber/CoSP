Well what do you feel about the , um , present situation in the Mideast ? 

Well , it looks like it 's just about as volatile as it usually is . Uh-huh . What do you think , Mark ? Yeah , I agree . I think , I think there 's definitely been some changes , um , and I think you know , the , the , um , end of the Soviet Union will definitely have its effect on , on the situation . Oh , yeah . Um , you know , in that there 's , there 's not , you kno , there , you know , i- , you know , basically since the end of World War two there was always , you know , that little proxy war going on . Uh-huh . You know , with , um , the U S funding Israel and , and the , um , Soviet Union funding the Arab countries . And then we 'll see what happens when , uh , they 're not funded quite as much . Yeah . Or supplied with arms the same way . Uh-huh . Yeah , but on the same token , you know , Israel has lost a lot of their , you know , value to the U S in being , you know , the foothold of capitalism . Uh-huh . You know in , in the Mideast . Well , I , we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves , Uh-huh . you know , we s- , kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet -- Uh-huh . -- overall tend to support them . But , I think one of the most interesting things to me recently was , you know , during the war , Uh-huh . uh , in , uh , Kuwait was , uh , the fact that they did not retaliate , Uh-huh . for the , uh , scud missiles that were , uh , launched there . That just seemed to me to be a , uh , a phenomenal , uh , demonstration of restraint , and it must have reflected , uh , uh , some awful good , uh , diplomacy on the part of the U S . Uh-huh . Yeah , but on the other hand , you know , if they would have had a hard time retaliating because the , you know , they , they would n't have been given access to the friend or foe codes . 

I see . They basically would have , you know , had a , had a f- , they had , they would have had , had to fly through , you know , two enemies . 

Oh , you do n't think they got the codes from the U S already ? The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them . I see . I mean , of course , you know , public statements can be taken for , That 's true . They can , yet they , Uh-huh . Yeah . D- , Well what do y- , what about this situation with the , you know , the , uh , continual , uh , harassment by Iraq right now and , uh , apparently failing to let the , uh , arms inspectors have free access . 

Uh-huh . You know , well , to begin with , you know , I pretty much question or what , what the U S -s motives were in , uh , in , in actually the original involvement . Uh-huh . Uh , I , the cynical side of me says that , you know , it was more for , uh , the , the domestic political situation than for anything else . Huh , yeah , okay . You know , and that , you know , and for portraying Bush is a strong President . Sure . Uh , I mean I really , I really think that , that , my gut feeling is that , that , you know , he pretty much picked , picked the fight with , uh , with , um , Hussein . Uh-huh . I mean I 'm not , not saying at all that Hussein was n't quite willing to ge- , enter that fight . Right . But , you know , I think , I think that , that , um , we chose to have our official feelings hurt . Uh-huh . Where a lot w- , Well , do you think that , uh , we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and , uh , you know , move on into Kuwait and see what happens ? I think , I mean I thought , I think that , um , in the past we 've allowed lots of things like that to happen . Uh-huh . And I , I really do n't , I really do n't think that , I think , I think it was , it was , there were , there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests . Right . Um , Yeah , well may have been . You know , I 'm not saying that that 's not the case . Uh , Yeah . And I mean in , in , in along this line since , since , you know it , it really , it really did n't accomplish very much except we 're getting , getting , uh , the Iraqis out of Kuwait . Right . I just do n't , I just do n't , I , I , I d- , I , I , I do n't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and , you know , in , in fighting a second battle . No . Um , you know , over , over the , uh , over , over what , what probably wo n't accomplish him , accomplish much for him politically . No , it does n't look like we 're getting ready to do , to do much more in there . Uh-huh . Even at this point . Uh-huh . Yeah . Well what about , uh , do you have any , any views on , uh , Israel 's relation to the U S ? Do you , think we ought to , you know , back off on our support of the country or what do yo- , Well , I have , I have very fixed feelings about Israel . Um , I think that , that for a long while we 've , we 've had almost a , you know , ha- , t- ,
