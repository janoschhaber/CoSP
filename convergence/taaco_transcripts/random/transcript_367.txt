Okay , well , just to let you know , I have , uh , two , uh , children of my own . I 've got two boys , uh , one four year old and one two years old , so I 'm just starting out . Oh , yes . I have two boys who are twenty-eight and twenty-four -- Wow . -- and a daughter who is twelve . Wow , that 's quite a spread . Yes . Same husband , everything . That 's great . Uh , but , Well , I guess , uh , in one of the things that , that I like to do with my boys when , uh , when I get home is , I like to try and spend a lot of time with them . You know , they 're not very old , so they could n't do a whole lot , yet . Uh-huh . But they like to , uh , spend time with me . We just , oh , just do various things , nothing really . They like to be outside as much as possible . If it 's not raining . Right , uh , but , you know , the weather 's trying to turn now so , Are , are you down here in Texas ? Yes , I -- Oh . -- I 'm , I 'm in , uh , Dallas . Okay , yeah . 

You know what I meant with rain , huh . Right , 

right . Oh . Right . Okay , uh , what , Yeah , what , w- , well , one of the things I 've noticed is , one of the trends I 've , I 've noticed is that , uh , it 's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the T V and let them watch movies or , or play video games or something . Yeah , I , I have , can you hold on just a sec- , -- Sure . -- I have to answer a business phone . Sure . I hate to do it on this call . That 's okay . Good morning , A R E , this is Arlene Lister . 

It was just a recorded message , on our business phone anyway . I 'm sorry , keep going . No , it 's okay . Uh , so that was the thing that I , I noticed that , I know a lot of people , lot of friends that we have , they have a tendency to do the same thing . And one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible . Uh-huh . Although it really is very easy to do that type of thing . Just plop them down in front of the T V and let them be , uh , entertained that way . 

And , uh , seeing as you 've got -- Yeah . -- some older children , I , I 'm wondering , how did you handle that , 

when they were growing up ? Well , there , there was not nearly as much of it . In fact , I , I think things were , were quite a bit different . Uh-huh . Uh , when my , my big kids were , were little , uh , you know , ev- , ev- , all the mothers were home . Uh-huh . You know , the , the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around and then when they felt like it , they went out to play , you know -- Uh-huh . -- when they were , were little like that . Right . And , uh , I , I think it 's gotten , uh , very different . When my second one was little , they were coming out with SESAME STREET -- Right . -- which he started watching and , other than that , I mean , there was basically , there was not educational T V or -- Um . -- uh , you know , you got some cartoons and that was it , but they , they were never that interested in it anyway . They 'd rather , I mean , they 'd take their trucks out in the backyard , you know -- Right . -- go out and play and stuff . But , we always did , uh , oh , just , you know , to the park for walks -- Uh-huh . -- and to the zoo and museum . We did a lot of stuff like that -- Uh-huh . -- with , uh , with our kids . And , course , when they got bigger , uh , they were both quite into sports and , and -- Uh-huh . -- you know , so whatever , you know , they would do , we 'd go along with -- Yeah . -- and , uh , , uh , a girl is very different . We have , a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping . Right . So , they 're very , very different , but , uh , y- , kind of the same thing , our , you know , she now , lot of time spent with her , she 's so busy is , uh -- Uh-huh . -- you know , going to , you know , like last night was a band concert -- Uh-huh . -- and she plays on her school volleyball team and , uh , stuff like that . But , uh , we , we still , uh , oh , like to pack up , you know , just go someplace for the day -- Right . -- or , uh , you know , just stuff like that . One of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at College Station -- Oh , that 's nice . -- so that 's , uh , we go down there fairly often , you know , for a weekend for , you know , family get-togethers and stuff like that . That 's great . Uh , That 's great . I know we 'd , I 'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things . And I think we probably will soon as the boys get a little -- Uh-huh . -- bit older . But , uh , you know , for right now , they do n't , you know , just getting out in the front , and just being outside is good for them because they like -- Oh , yes . -- just being outside . Yeah , I , I think , our kids just always dearly loved that , you know , play bounce the ball , or -- Uh-huh . -- just , uh , course , when our big ones were little , we lived up north , you know -- Uh-huh . -- and this time of the year it , it , the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves , you know . Right . So , That 's true , you do n't see many leaves around Dallas . You know , so it 's , it 's very different and , and , uh , you know , we also , come winter time we 'd stick them on sleds . And -- 

Uh-huh . -- uh , we had a pond across the street and , and from little on , you know , I 'm , it 's , it 's so different down here where y- , you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something . You know , when our kids were little you , you got them a pair of skates .
