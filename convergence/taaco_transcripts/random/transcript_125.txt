MUMBLEx Capital punishment , uh , I guess , out in California is , has had a lot of , uh , a lot of , you know , discourse in the paper . Uh , apparently , you know , there 's , they have n't , uh , executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven , I believe . Uh , yeah . That 's , that 's as far back as I can remember . Well , that 's before -- Yeah , they , -- my time actually . Well , I , we were , we , uh , we just started , we lived in Redwood City when we were out there . Uh-huh . And , uh , and we found that , uh you know , it was a very liberal kind of community . But the , uh , I , I really feel that , that the law enforcement community , uh , you know , puts these people behind bars and then they , they , uh , uh , you know , lawyers , these lawyer groups get together and they , uh , they , I think , extend beyond the normal , uh , appeal process . Uh , you know , and just drag these , this guy , uh , his , his , uh , ultimate , uh , demise out for ten or fifteen years . Uh , and I , I think that , uh , that there 's something that has to be changed in the system to , to do that . I think capital punishment , uh , uh , was or probably stringent enough but I think the appeal process is really getting in the way . Uh-huh . Do , do you feel as though there should be , uh , more , uh , was or , or more , uh , you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by , uh , by , uh , uh , capital punishment ? Well I think that currently the way the law stands is n't so much that the laws are enforceable or not , it 's more they 're not enforcing the death penalty itself . It 's at that point where they 're saying like here you 're , you 're going on death row but you 'll stay there for twenty years . Uh-huh . And nothing is being done about it . Uh , the laws exist and MUMBLEx are frequently upheld in , in , uh , in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find . And it 's , it 's really getting out of hand MUMBLEx in many states . Well , the term technicality MUMBLEx . The law enforcement community , uh , uh , you know , has to , has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which , uh , grievous acts are done to , uh , to , you know , to get somebody into a , a situation where they 're going to be guilty of , of a crime . Or whether , uh , an- , and whether the rights of that individual are been , have been , you know , impuned . Uh , but or whether there 's just , you know , a policeman has just made a , uh , a , you know , a non , a noncritical error , though be it not the right way to do it but , but , you know , the , the merits of the case in terms of , you know , the guy was a law breaker , as being supportive . Now , I , I 'm , a- , a- , at this juncture I , you know , I 'm , I 'm not sure , you know , what constitutes a , a technicality . You know , that , that 's what all c- , these , these hearings are about and that 's what all these , you know , court cases are about . I mean our , uh , our , our glorious , uh , you know , mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of , out of the can and , uh , you know , he , he tried to appeal his conviction . Uh , and , you know , it did n't work . But be that as it may , everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry . Uh , in , in the old days , you know , and say round about times of battle of Hastings , you know , and the villages if you were a transgressor , they , they either , you know , drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody and he , you were his slave . And if he did n't like what you did , he killed you . And that has , that 's pretty effective . Uh , you know , it 's not good for civil rights , I guess , but it 's pretty effective in that , you know , you 've got to get along in the community and if you do n't you 'll perish . Either by the hand of your , your , your master or by being pushed out in the woods . So , I , I , I mean as , as man has gotten more complicated so all of the , uh , imaginations to , uh , you know , protect him from , from being , uh , dumped on by , uh , civilian authority in , in so- , in criminal actions , especially , you know , murder cases and that sort of thing . Well , it seems like , well it , it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished , and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually did n't the crimes , albeit it seems that we are failing in that , in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off . Um , for instance , um there 's a case a few years back where , uh , someone , uh , someone who 's being convicted for , was under a tri- , was going to trial for murder , was let off because of a technicality in that . The of- , the arresting officer , uh , did not read the defendant their rights . 

Uh-huh . And where his , old evidence was there , the witnesses were there , the , everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet ,
