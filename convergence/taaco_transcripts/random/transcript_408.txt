All right . I think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight . Which is movies , correct ? That is correct . Okay . Are you a movie buff ? Um , yeah . I do n't like going to see them in the theaters but outside of that , rent a lot , 

watch them on T V mostly . Well , I have a V C R and I see most all of mine there . What have you seen recently that you enjoyed ? Uh , I do n't know , um , actually earlier tonight we were watching TO LIVE AND DIE IN L A . Have you seen that movie ? No , I have n't . It 's a kind of one of those psycho ones . Now , I , I live alone . Consequently , I do n't like these sa- , psycho things . Oh , it 's not too bad . One of those cop thrillers but , Oh , okay . Have you seen the mov- , if , do you have a V C R ? Yes , we do . Have you seen the movie CLASS ACTION with Gene Hackman ? Uh , no , I have n't yet . I saw it this weekend and it is , uh , to me an outstanding movie . I thoroughly enjoyed it . He is , uh , an attorney and his daughter is an attorney and she has a suit against his company . You know , it 's one of those things . Yeah , that , But there 's a lot of l- , well , it 's just it 's something that anyone can watch and enjoy . He 's a good actor though . Beg your pardon ? Um , Gene Hackman 's a good actor . Yes , he is . I think . 

Do you see HOOSIERS ? Yes . I 've seen HOOSIERS . Saw it just again the other night , for , Yeah , actually I , we saw her just the other night too . Oh , did you ? Yeah . It 's one of our favorite movies . I , I live with , um , a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us . We 've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months . Have you seen the movie , um , CROSSING DELANCY ? Yeah . Now , that 's one I have watched , oh , six or eight times . I always feel so good when I get through with that movie . Yeah , I like those movies that you watch time and time again . I do too . DIRTY DANCING and CROSSING DELANCY are two of my favorite . So , well what business are you in ? I 'm , I 'm an electrical engineer . Oh . In New Hampshire . All right . I work in Massachusetts actually . Oh , all right . Okay . So is everything going all right up there ? Um , it 's only about , um , half an hour . 

I live wi- , on the border . Oh , well that 's that bad then . Half an hour , we do that just going to downtown Dallas . That 's right . So , See we live up in tax free New Hampshire and drive down to Massachusetts to work . That makes a lot of sense . But , um , we , are you a native of that part of the country ? Yeah , I grew up in New Hampshire . It seems , southern town , it 's called Portsmouth . It 's , I do n't know , fifteen minutes from the Mass- , border and five minutes from the main border . We live right in the corner . Oh . That one little spot in New Hampshire , we have ten miles of coastline , I live on one of tho- , that little ten mile spot . Uh , sounds wonderful . Did you have damage this year with hurricanes ? Not up , um , where I live but further down the coast in Massachusetts they got hit pretty bad . I happened to be in Nassau and we got the backlash of that thing . And they had record high waves , thirty year high waves come in there , and it was quite an experience so . Well , what movies are you looking forward to seeing now ? Um , well , I 'm , I 'm only twenty-seven years old so THE DOORS movie , that 's out on video . I want to watch that . Okay . Have you seen GREEN CARD ? That would be pretty good . No , I have n't seen that one . That 's a real warm movie . It , it really just turned out nicely . So I would recommend that if you have a chance . I 'm in for it . We rent a lot of movies so we , we often sit around and say , what movies should we rent ? And we do n't know . Well if you , if you can get GREEN CARD , go for it . All right , we 'll try that one . I have been working at , uh , as an accountant at the medical school here in Dallas and I have watched , uh , GROSS ANATOMY . Have you seen that one ? Yeah , I did . Okay . And I do n't know I can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students I see over at the medical school . But I hope you have a very Merry Christmas . You too . I 'm looking forward to it . I think we 're going to have a white Christmas up here just like the song says . Well ,
