Okay , well personally , I do n't have any children . I 'm twenty-two and I 'm doing my Master 's at N C State -- Oh , uh-huh . -- so , uh , uh , children would n't be very convenient for me right now . Well , no , would they , no . So what , what , how do you spend the time with your children ? Well both of mine are boys . They 're -- Um . -- eight and eleven -- Okay , and did , -- and they 're into sports -- Yeah . -- I mean , as a matter of fact , that 's what we 're doing tonight . What , what are you doing ? Baseball has started . Oh , okay . Do , do they play like , uh , like does the eight year old play baseball ? Oh , oh , yes , we start here at , uh , five . Okay , and , and in , in his league do they have like a pitcher , or do they have a standing ball or a machine , or what ? Up until , it 's coach pitch , until you get nine -- Okay . -- which my little boy will be nine in May . So he 's going to be with , uh , regular pitching -- Oh , okay . -- and my eleven year old , of course , you know , is pitching . Yeah . I , I used to play soccer when I was that age -- Uh-huh . -- up in New York , so . But yes , we 're into baseball , and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball . We even have peewee basketball here . So there 's always something . Yeah , and how about , how about like on the weekends . Do you do sports or do you go out ? Both . If we 're not doing sports we go somewhere . Do you go , how about like for , uh , do you go for long vacations , like a week or something when they have school off ? Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . In the summer or like in the Easter time , like around now ? No , usually in the summer time . And where do you go ? Different places every year . We , Have , have you been out of the country ? 

No . Oh , okay , well , first , they always say , get to know your country first before you leave , I mean -- Uh-huh . -- I , I lived in places , like when I lived in Washington , uh , Washington , D C , I never went to the Washington Memorial , and then when I went back to visit , I went to the Washington Memorial . You know , I 've heard , we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often , and that must be the thing . They really had n't either . They went to the Memorial , you know , when they go , it 's on business -- Right . -- it 's not really just to getting to sight see . Right . Well , it 's , it 's a beautiful city . Oh , I bet it is , too . But , the problem is , like first time I went out of here , and they took me to Las Vegas -- Uh-huh . -- and that was the most boring place on earth . Oh , now my husband and I , we go different places . But our child- , but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close . Yeah . Did , uh , did , like , did you go to Disneyland ? Oh , yes , yes , yes . Oh , okay . So , but um , now , I do n't know , but um , but let 's see , when I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean . Oh . and , uh , then after that , I , my sister lives in Turkey , so when I was like fourteen , fifteen , I went , I went to Turkey . Oh , And this Christmas , I went to Turkey . But basically , it 's a , for the past couple of years , I , since my parents are , are , well , I 'm from Argentina , and my parents live down there . So , all the traveling I do is alone . 

Uh-huh . And , uh , we were never much of , uh , a very , uh , family thing , you know , made , like go skiing in Vermont or something . Uh-huh . That was , uh , that was a lot of fun . Yes . But , what happens is we used to fight a lot , so there 's never much of a family family thing . You know , one of those hell family vacations . Oh , yes , but we try , you know , I try , my husband also , we 're involved in everything our kids does -- Yeah . -- because , uh , my dad died , you know , when I was less than a year old -- Yeah . -- so I always just had a mother . So I always thought , when I have kids , you know , I really want to be involved with them . Well , my dad , all he , all he wanted to do was get money for us , so he could buy us material things . Material things , yes , that is , yes , And , and to me , you know , it 's like , now I 'm twenty-two , but I still feel , you know , it 's like yeah , we never threw a football or something -- Uh-huh . -- and the way I was brought up , 

and he wants me now , he , like he , you know , like he wants to be best friends now -- Best friends , now . -- and it 's very hard for me because , you know , it 's like you grow up to be twenty years old , and it 's always the same man -- Uh-huh . -- and then suddenly he sees that he 's getting old , and he wants to be best friends -- 

Yeah . -- but , uh , you know , it 's like , I can only express myself so much , because , you know , um , everything that he taught me , you know , that my family taught me , which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say , I 'm sorry , you know . It 's like , you know , I love you and let 's go out and do things together when I do n't feel like it , you know -- 

Uh-huh . -- and so , that 's that whole thing that he 'll say when , like , like I 've seen my uncle and his family , you know , does everything together , and you know , his kids are , you know , when his little girl was five years old and everything , they , uh , they would go to the beach , and she could go to sleep at two in the morning -- Oh , uh-huh . -- you know -- Yeah . 

-- and , uh , I was brought up the same way , it does n't matter what age you have , just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning , you can stay up -- Uh-huh . -- you know , but his , what he does is , when he gets home , he separates his work from his house . 

Yeah , you have to -- Yeah . -- I mean , you honestly do . Now I have friends that I love to death , but , and they have children , but their children does anything , we have to take them , and , you know -- Yeah . -- to do it . And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while 

because you 're saying , Well , I work full time too , you know . Yeah , yeah , but , uh , it 's just , it 's just something that , you know , my theory is , you know , when , when you have kids and all you , you want to do , well , what I 'll do is , you know , like , I mean , you might have problems , but it 's not your kids ' problems -- Yeah , oh , yeah . -- you know , and you got to try to be with them as much as you can and to , you know , like , thing is , is , that , you know , like if , if they would ever happen to have a drug problem , suppose , that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying , I got a problem -- Problem , uh-huh -- you know , and , uh -- Yeah . 

-- and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time , you know , first of all you 're coming to me and let 's see how we can get rid of the problem , you know , and that 's uh , that 's very , that 's very hard to do , because once you 're best friends with your parents , then , I think everything go a lot better . Uh-huh , yeah , I agree with you very much so . Now , we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college , and we knew time wise , or , and money wise , too -- Yeah . -- would , it would not have been a good idea to had them then . Yeah , my , my father was raising four ki- , oh well , three kids before he had me , so it was , uh , you know , you 're trying , to support , uh , four kids , and it 's pretty hard -- Yeah . -- you know , and I , I told him , listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids . Uh-huh , yeah . He says yeah , but then I would n't have you , I go , yeah , but then you would have a lot of money . That 's right , but you ca n't take this money with us , though -- Yeah . -- that 's how I keep looking at it . But , you know , like , four , I mean fou- , four children is expensive , especially when you consider like , especially for me , which I 'm paying out of state tuition . I 'm paying , you know , three thousand , no , what is it , two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester . Oh . And , you know , people say , you know , it 's expensive to think it 's college , but , if , if everybody would be a little bit responsible , you know , it 's like , what does it , what does it cost . It costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose . Now they go to a state college and they live at home -- Uh-huh . -- you know , and well , it costs two hundred dollars for books , but you know , seven hundred dollars a semester , a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead , you know , like -- Oh , yeah , 

if you cou- , if you can , yeah . -- I mean , it 's like , if you plan a year ahead , you can probably save up seven hundred dollars -- Yeah . -- you know , one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college , you know . What are you learning to be ? Oh , oh , excuse me ? What degree , I mean , what are you wanting to do after you get out of college ? Well , I , I 'm doing computer science , computer engineering . Oh , that 's , my husband 's into , uh , computers . Yeah , and , and now I 'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home -- Uh-huh . -- because since I 'm an international student , they want to send me back to -- Yeah . -- Argentina . Well , my dad wants me to go back . So . And you do n't want to ? No . No , no . No , because if you go back there , then you can never get out . Oh . Like you do n't have any money to , to , get out . Oh . So , uh , and , uh , I was thinking , you know , like , Oh my God , you know , I go back there , and then , and I get married there , and now I have kids there , and then I 'll never leave the place , you know . Then you 'll never leave . Yeah , 

I know , and that 's , that 's what happened to my brother . He came to school up here , and then when he went down there , he was just so bad off , you know -- Oh . -- from not being able to stay up here that -- Uh-huh . -- his life just went down the drain . So . Well maybe something will open up for you . Yeah , 

I 've been calling a lot of companies . There , some of them are interested . Well , at least for a year and a half -- Uh-huh . -- I can work , so . Well , may- , well I 've enjoyed talking to you . All right , same here . Okay , bye-bye . Bye-bye .
