Did you hear our topic ? It 's in regards to discussing homes . Homes , yes , sir , uh-huh . What are , are you settled in a place ? Yeah , I 'm settled in a place . I 've been in it for twelve years , since nineteen , uh , actually thirteen years , since nineteen seventy-eight and it 's in Richardson , Texas , which is north Texas -- Right . -- or north Dallas . Uh-huh . And we 've lived in two houses in Richardson . We moved here in seventy-four and , uh , changed locations in seventy-eight . Okay . How about yourself ? Well , we , uh , left here in seventy-six . Uh , we were here for a few years , then we , uh , have come back just this summer . Right now we 're looking for housing , uh , somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area . Are you familiar with that ? Yeah , it 's a nice area . Yeah , 

it is . The kids are in school here in Duncanville . We 're in a temporary place right now and , uh , so they 've enjoyed the school , so we 're kind of trying to stay here but , Are you finding it tough trying to find what you want or , Well , what , the problem we got is that we 've got five children -- Oh , boy . -- and so , uh , we really want four or five bedroom house and , uh , you know , everybody says , you know , how many houses are on the market and -- R- , right . 

-- all that kind of thing so we , uh , we look at the paper , we look at our , talk to our realtor and you can cut , you know , the listings , uh , in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms -- Sure . -- you know , or five . Are you looking or you settled , I mean , No , we 're settled and , uh -- H , having , -- we 're , uh , I 'm probably older than you , I 'm fifty-two , but anyway , I , my youngest is getting married this year -- Oh , great . -- graduating college , so I can board up their rooms ,  and look forward to retirement maybe . That empty nest syndrome is going to set in , I guess . Oh , gosh , so , we 're looking forward to retiring in about three years and -- 

Great . -- maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere . Okay . Closer , closer to our families . Okay , you , are you from Florida originally ? No , from West Virginia but everyone 's , uh , my wife 's parents are from the New York , New Jersey area -- Yeah . -- so , but everyone seems , uh , has seem to relocated down that area . Oh , yeah . Seems like a nice place to go . Yeah , yeah . We 've got five and the oldest is , uh , ninth grade and the youngest is second grade and I think they 're going to be , uh , with us forever .  I do n't know if that 's true , but it 's sure , you know , we 're not anywhere near looking to , uh , uh , cut down in size . We 're , we 're -- Oh , I -- -- trying to -- -- understand . -- find , You need very minimum four and probably five . Oh , yeah . In fact , six would be real good . Right . My wife and I can share a bedroom . It 's tough -- Either , 

-- to find a five and six room , bedroom house , is n't it ? Oh , I do n't think it 's possible unless you , you know , multimillionaire , something like that . Oh , I know . Uh , Seems like you get in that category , you 're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever and it 's -- Oh , yeah . -- that 's an awful lot , you know . Yeah , it is , yeah . MUMBLEx . Uh , we 're having , actually , if we find something for , uh , I 'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand , we 'll be doing all right , you know . Right . 

That 's , uh , but I think the thing 's out there , it 's just a matter of , uh -- Just , -- you know , looking -- Matter -- -- you know -- -- of looking , right . -- finding the right place , uh , Lot of people will buy , in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or the , or do something . I had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school and she had , uh , there were seven kids in her family . Wow . And they converted the dining room and ,  did this and that , but they always seemed to get along fine , you know . Oh , yeah , yeah . I think once we get into a place , it will be just fine , 

but -- Oh , sure . -- you know , it 's until then , it 's , uh , oh , a little stressful , you know , just looking all the time and that sort of thing . Oh , I know and it 's , there 's nothing harder than that . I always just sort of a , assign my wife that chore , then I would let her narrow it down to three or four , then I 'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do . Oh , yeah .  Maybe that 's the case . At least she 's got more opinions , you know , there 's , uh , seems like there 's more constraints -- Yes . -- more things that she thinks about . You know , openness , uh , the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that I would -- Why , certainly . -- probably gloss over and , 

 maybe even ignore , you know . I -- So . -- understand that . What kind of business are you in ? I 'm in the , uh , sporting goods business . I 'm a manufacturer 's rep . I represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies . Oh , yeah , great . What , who are you with ? Uh , we 're with an organization called , uh , Wycliff Bible Translators . Uh-huh . It 's a , a missions organization and , uh , doing , uh , translation , linguistics , that sort of thing . Well , great . Uh , it 's got an office down here in , uh , in , near Duncanville and we just moved down to be on staff down here so . How , how was the , uh , s , you say you lived in the Denver area before ? Right . How did that compare with this area as far as house- , housing prices ? Uh , we were , uh , really surprised to find that they 're higher here . Uh , No kidding . When we moved from Louisiana to Denver , it was astounding , you know , to find that prices were , oh , I guess almost two or three times as high as we 'd expected . And then , uh , to come down here , we thought things would be lower , and they 're not . I guess , uh , really , prices for housing are just ,
