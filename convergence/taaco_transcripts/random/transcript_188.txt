Okay , what do you think about it ? Well , uh , the roles have definitely changed -- Oh , yeah . -- in the last generation or so . Um , I think a lot of it has to do with women working . Uh-huh , yeah , I do too . I think it 's going to , in , like in the future , I think all women are going to work . Yeah . I mean , they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby , but that will be it , Yeah . or either they 'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just , you know , just continue right on with your work . Ye- , yeah . I mean , i- , it really is coming to that because most women now days can not afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them . Right , right . They ca n't even afford to take off , you know , to have children it seems like . And it , and it seems , if you 're going to have kids , uh , that you are , you know , society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it . Yeah . And , uh , because if you have , you know , two , well , if you go to work , you 're , just working to pay for day care , 

Right . two or three , you know , um . Now , I was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were , you know , when I had them and when they were small , Uh-huh . until they got in junior high school , my youngest got in junior high , I did n't have to work . Oh , that is good . I mean I did n't work , I , I needed to but I did n't . Yeah , Steve 's , Steve has a sister who has four . She just had her fourth one in , uh , March and she does n't have to work either . I do n't know how they do it . I don- , I do n't know how people do it with one , 

you know , um obviousl- , Let me tell you , you go without a lot of things that you wo , you know . yeah , obviously we do n't have any and , and I do n't , I think that 's part of the role reversal , is it 's okay to get married and not have kids . 

Oh yeah . And I think for society for such a long time said , well , you know , you 're married , now you need to sa- , have , have your family and I do n't think it 's been until recently that , that they had decided that two people was a family . Right , right . You know and , Well it 's getting where you ca n't hardly afford , if you 're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you ca n't hardly afford to have over two . Right . And I mean it 's hard with two , now , we , uh , my youngest one , I have two , I have a son and a daughter , and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon , Oh ! and if I had a third one , Yea- , I just do n't know where it would come from . Yeah . Because I work now , 

I work full time and , uh , you know , it , 

when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got . Yeah . They get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that , that helps out , but still , it cost a lot . Oh , yeah , I mean , just the , you know , the cost of living and loans do n't pay for groceries and stuff . Right , and cars and all their books , and the books are outrageous . Oh , I know , I know . I mean , absolutely outrageous , and they 're getting worse . Uh , my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for her , one of her next classes and it was like ninety-six dollars . Gee . And this book is a little bitty skinny book . Yeah . I said my goodness , what is it , lined in gold , you know , uh . Yeah . But it is , it 's getting worse , and , if I 'd of probably had three or four children , I do n't see how we could have made it , you know , without me working . But that 's , that 's probably because , you know , if you had three , you , you know , would say , if I 'd of had four . I guess it 's always not , not being able to picture one more , but in essence you probably would have worked out fine . Right , but I think I would have had to work . Yeah . If I 'd of had that many , I 'd of had to work in order for my kids to , you know , even though he brings in a real good living and everything , in order for me to keep up , I would have had to work . Yeah . But I think it 's getting more and more like , when you have one child now , that 's it , you know , then you go to work and you work , Yeah . because if you have two or three kids , by the , e- , way the inflation 's going I think a woman 's always going to have to work and it 's just going to be an accepted thing . There is n't going to be any of this , you know , very few people will ever stay home . Yeah , and , and that 's all right with me , because I do n't want to stay home -- Yeah . -- you know , I think I 'm just part of tha- , the new stuff , that is just , I do n't know , I think I would just go nuts sitting at home all day long . Well you know , I ca n't imagine how I did , because now I work all the time , Yeah . and , um , well I work all week , and , um , I ca n't imagine how I stayed home . Yeah . You know , I think to myself , what did I do . And I think it just , it revolutionized an , where a woman thinks that a way , you know , just like , now my daughter , there 's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she 's at now . To her everything is , you 've got to go through college , you 've got to get a job , you know . And then when everything 's set up , then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with , but . Right . I mean it is so far down the road , where , now when I graduated high school , That 's , you did , that 's what you did . the thing , uh-huh , 

and then you got married and then you had a family . Uh . I mean that 's just the way it was , you know . Yeah . And , uh , that 's like when my mo- , I know when my mother 's age it was always the kids and the family and everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them , 

an . I , uh , I , I like the way it is . Yeah . It 's , uh , being , see , we 're from Houston and so it 's not so hard for people , you know , you 've been married three or so years and you do n't have kids , well it 's okay , no- , nobody does . But you come to a place like Belton , and th- , a lot of the kids here get married out of high school . Uh-huh . It 's real small town , and i- , and a lot of people in our su- , we 're the only couple in our Sunday School class , except for one other couple , who are in their forties , and they ca n't have children , who do n't have children . And they ca n't imagine why we would want to have children . And , I 'm going well , you know , there 's more to life , you know , there 's life in there that 's , you know , not everybody has to have kids , and , I 'd rather spend the time with my husband than , you know , spending time , here , it 's your turn , you know . Yeah , but , you know , that , now even whenever I was coming up and everything and we got married right out of high school , well a year after I got out of high school , Uh-huh . and , uh , I did n't have kids for four and a half years but that was because I wanted to work and I was n't ready for kids . Yeah , I think that 's what it is , I 'm not either . And , everybody thought , oh , my gosh , what is the matter with her , you know . They 're probably going , oh , I bet she ca n't get pregnant Right , I mean they thought that it was terrible , you know , and then when I 'd tell them , you know , well I 'm just not ready for children yet , oh , but that , you know , you better , you better just get ready now . Yeah . Well you do n't just get ready . But I was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time , they had kids within a year . Yeah . And I just was not ready for kids . I wanted to get out and work a little bit and I wanted to travel and stuff like that , which we did . And , uh , kids did n't fit in right then , but , it 's getting more and more like that where there 's more and more couples and , really , if you do n't want the kids , then it 's not the time to have , I do n't care what anybody tells you . Right . And I think that more and more the attitude 's getting that a way . Because that 's like my daughter now , she says that , you know , maybe when she 's thirty she might want a child then . Yeah . And , uh , even though I 'd like to have grandchildren , I can see her point . Yeah , Steve 's mom finally , uh , finally s , you know , said that , that God will take care of us when it 's our time . Right . She finally admitted , you know , she finally told me it 's okay if you do n't , but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she 's from a very , very old fashioned family . Uh-huh . And , she stayed home and raised her kids and , and she expected all of her kids to do that too , and their wives and to be the , the housewife and have dinner ready by five and , and , you know , be there at every beck and call and , I was raised totally opposite . How we got together , I do n't know , but . Because my mother had six girls , and , you know , she worked too . Yeah . And , I guess I just and I saw how life was when she stayed home and it was rough , it was hard , and , uh . Yeah , and it really is , I know , just like now , you know , there 's , there 's so much more now . All my income goes for things like luxuries , I mean , it really does . Uh-huh . Accept for what we give to my daughter , to , you know , put her through college and stuff . But the rest of it we just buy things like boats , or we go on trips , or , you know , just -- Right . -- the more or less like entertainment stuff , but . 

Yeah , I think you 've , you 've earned that though . Yeah , I feel like I have , you know , because well , we 're just a age now , I 'm not old but , I 'm older . Uh-huh . And , uh , I got to stay home with my kids , which I really wanted to do , but now I could not go back and do it . Yeah . And I mean , I did stuff but , Right . to me it feels like I must have done nothing . And I think it 's just the new way that people are thinking . Yeah , I think so . But , uh , I think it would be neat if , if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you . Well you know more and more of them are , I do n't know if it is up there where you are but where I am , the , just like all the hospitals , Uh-huh . they 're getting day care . Are they ? But the reason they had to do this was because so many people , you know , so many women could not afford , like you said if you had four kids , or even if you had two kids , you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go . Right . So , uh , more and more of our hospitals , especially , over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies , but it 's mainly the hospitals . Yeah , I do n't know if the T I in Dallas does or not . I know , I know nobody around here does , it , we 're , it 's too small around here . Oh really . Yeah .
