Okay , so now what are your opinions on recycling ? Well , I definitely think that we need to start recycling . 

I think it has got to be an individual responsibility until , I think if we wait , uh , which is happening until somebody says we have to do it -- Yeah . -- it is going to be to late . I have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand . Yeah , I have heard that too . And that is not too far away , but I do n't know how it is there . It is very difficult here even if you care like I do to do much . I take , my paper , I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store -- Uh-huh . -- and I can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them and there are some fire stations I can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause I have to wait until I have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile . Well see , I started saving newspapers and I would take a ton of them -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , that 's , I ca n't remember where I went to take them , but they would n't take them . Yeah . It is real hard to find a spot and then , I do n't know if you note , even doing that , the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles -- Oh I know . -- glass that can not be , it could be recycled , but there is no place to , There is no really recycling facilities . No . We have a pilot program in Arlington going on I think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as , the trash as they put it out . I think that is a good idea . And I think that is what it is going to have to come to . Where we are just forced to . Besides , well like a law or whatever . An- , that 's how it is -- 

Yeah . -- in New York is n't it . I think so , just because they have to . Uh-huh . 

You know , And you get ticketed if you do n't do it right . Right , uh-huh . And I think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the , it 's , It 's trouble for me to do what I do -- Yeah . -- I mean , I am willing to do it but , Plus you have to have a place to store all of it -- Yeah . -- and see I live in an apartment . Yeah . 

It is very difficult . Like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers and , so , I do n't know . I think there needs to be more places and also I have a real strong opinion . In Iowa , the state I am from -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I believe it has gone up to a dollar now . Every time you buy a container , no matter what it is , whether it is glass , whether it 's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever , you pay ten cents for it -- Yeah . -- and then you take it back to the store and you get it back . Uh , so that way it kind of forces you to recycle . You are forced to . And , uh , you also do n't see the litter there . People just , Yeah , that 's true . It makes it worthwhile to take it back and I 've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian , I do n't know if you 've tried it -- Yeah , I have seen them . -- and they have on the ba- , it 's five cents , that they pay five cents -- Uh-huh . -- and it even shows the states that , That take them back . Yeah . Well , on- , some of them are five , some are ten cents . I am looking at it right now . Is Texas one of them ? Texas is not one of them see . So , I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass . Yeah . No , I do n't think that there is enough being done . Now , I work at J C PENNY at their corporate headquarters . Uh-huh . And we have a paper recycling program that , uh , is company wide and I do the recycling for that . Do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper . Yeah . Good . Because there is a lot of waste there is n't there . Yeah . And I know there is a lot of computer paper -- Right . -- that you ca n't use . Right . But , uh , we use to have , uh , I mean , I do n't even remember how much money that they 've , uh , I mean , the money that they 've made from the recycling program . They have donated it to charities . Right . I mean -- Yeah . -- they have made a substantial amount of money from it . 

Something else I think we do can do is support companies that encourage like , I have decided Downy Fabric Softener now has where you can buy a little carton -- Yeah . -- you add wa- , well , I image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later , but I am going to stick with Downey because they were first . Yeah . 

And I want them to have my business . And I think packaging could be done much better . There is so much plastic . 

But , Well I know , you see some of the stuff and then when they come out with the new things , you are like , well why did n't you think of that before . Yeah . Yeah . And I think that it 's just people have got to be aware . Unfortunately , there are a lot of people that just do n't care and they do n't want to think about it . Yeah , that 's true . And , uh , I just look at it , I do n't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why did n't you do something . You know , I want to feel like I at least tried . Yeah . And I do n't know . It just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it . Then we will be forced to . It may be too late . Do they not ever , I mean , I do n't know that much . Do they not ever burn trash or anything like , Very little . That 's another thing that , see there were no , Then , that 's pollution . I know Amway . I use a couple of things from Amway that it says this is burnable material . Well , that does n't do me any good because I do n't have any place to burn it . Yeah , I know . I guess you run into the pollution factor . Yeah . And then just like the glass bottles , that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents , but not in Texas . Yeah . And there is no place I can take glass to . Uh , So , I still throw away a lot of glass . It is really sad . Yeah . And then the packaging thing really grips me . You buy some and it 's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic ,
