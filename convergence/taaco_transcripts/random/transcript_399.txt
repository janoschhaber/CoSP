So how many , um , credit cards do you have ? Um , I think I 'm down to one . Oh , my gosh , I wish I was that way . Is that why you said I had more experience than you ? Well , no . I was pulling your leg . Oh . Well , how , how do you use your credit card ? I mean , do you just keep it in reserve , 

or . I , I , well , the way I 'd like to try and use it is , um , you , you , you make your purchases at , at prime buying time -- Uh-huh . -- and then you pay that off and do n't use it until , uh , it 's paid off . Uh-huh . That 's , that 's my ideal way . Uh-huh . How , how do you use it ? . Emergencies come along , and I -- Yeah -- -- and I use it . -- that 's understandable , exactly . Uh , like , uh , my car , uh , had a major problem , and -- Uh-huh . -- seven hundred dollars , and -- Right , right . -- uh , things just come up and you just never get to use it the way you 'd really like to . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Well , actually I do have quite a few more credit cards than you have . Um , and I use them , you know , like my American Express I use for , you know , gas , things like that , and I pay that off monthly , and then , um , some other credit cards , like store credit cards , you know , I do have them up there a little bit , but , uh . Uh-huh . I try not to use them too often . But living in this area , uh , like I live fifteen miles west of Washington , D C -- Um . -- it 's a very expensive area . Yeah . So , sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something . Yeah . Well , I , I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards , and I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble -- Right . -- so we just disposed of them , paid them off , and -- Uh-huh . -- got out of it . I just . Uh-huh , well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that . Yeah . Uh-huh . MUMBLEx . Now are you married , that you both , you and your wife use a credit card , or ? Yeah , yeah . 

Uh-huh . Well , now we pretty much just pay cash for -- Uh-huh . Um . -- as much as we can there . Uh-huh . Our , our only credit card is Sears , so -- Uh-huh , um . -- and I have that for automotive purposes . Right , right . Well , well that 's great . Um , everyone I know here uses , um , credit cards like they 're going out of business -- 

Yeah . -- to be honest with you . 

Yeah , it 's , it 's just too easy , basically , uh , just get yourself in trouble with those . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , the only other one I have , I have like a Diner 's Club through my , um , where I work -- I see . -- so that I use , because I travel some . So I use that , and I do n't really have to worry about that , because I only use it for business , so I automatically have the money to pay it off . Yeah . But . Um . Uh , I would n't mind , uh , you know , getting back into one if they would , you know , you start out at a low limit , and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit -- Uh-huh . -- and , and if I can get one that 'll keep my limit at five hundred -- Uh-huh . -- and I can never go over that or something -- Uh-huh . -- like that , then that 's fine , but they eventually gets up there to five thousand , ten thousand , whatever -- 

Uh-huh . -- fifty thousand -- Yeah . -- forget it , I do n't want that . Um , the temptation 's too great . Yeah . Um . So , I do n't know , just , uh , writing checks is just as easy I guess . Yeah , that 's true , that 's true , but . So , I guess , uh , we 've kind of exhausted this , uh , topic . Yeah , well , really , what , what can you . Yeah , you ca n't say too much about it really . Other than , you use them or you do n't use them . You like them or you do n't like them . So . Uh-huh . I guess , uh , they do n't care if we end it early . So , uh , hopefully , uh , you have a good Thanksgiving . That 's coming up , and . Okay , you , too . And , then , uh , maybe we 'll talk again . Yeah , may be , you 're the furthest person , actually , that I 've talked . 

I 've talked to a lot of people in Texas . Yeah . Yeah . Texas is the big one . Yeah , so . Okay , then . Well , bye now . O- , okay , bye-bye .
