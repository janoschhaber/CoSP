Well , uh , guess it 's logical to ask , do you exercise any ? Well , unfortunately very little . Uh , much less than what I need to . I 'm about the same way , I , I do a little bit . My job kind of hinders me from exercising . I 'm a night operator here at a industry down here and I do n't really get out a lot to , because my job , to , to exercise . Well , I , uh , am an assistant teacher and , uh , in business technology and I 've , I think the most exercise I 've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids ' questions . It keeps me pretty busy , but it 's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going . Right . And , uh , you know , it really , exercise is so important . It is . And I realize that . That 's , that 's the way I feel . I 'm used to being in pretty good shape because when I was in high school I stayed in pretty good shape , played a little basketball and stuff like that , but I 've got , now , I 'm in college and I go to school during the day and work at night . I can tell that I 've not really done a whole lot . When you , uh , exercise , what do you do ? Do you do it at home or a club or , Well , uh , I usually , I usually play at home . We live out in the country so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play or a lot of times we 're , we 're up at the church we 'll play volleyball stuff like that . I got a hold of , uh , Richard Simmons ' tape , uh -- Oh , really ? -- what is it , uh , I ca n't even think of the name of it right offhand , with the oldies . Oh , the SWEATING TO THE OLDIES ? Sweating with the , to the oldies , yeah and that 's not bad . Oh , really ? That 's pretty upbeat , so , you know , I , every once in a while I 'll put the cassette in and go with it . Right . Not often enough to have a routine . Right . I 'll , My little Schnauzer wishes I would get out and walk with her . Oh , really ? 

But , uh , I do n't know , by the time I get home , all I want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer 

and my fingers exercise more than anything now . Right , that 's the way I am . I just want to sit down and relax . Too tired to exercise . Yes . Uh , do you ever ride a bike or anything like that ? I did . I started riding my bike about a couple of months ago and I 'd ride about two or three miles a day , but , but it would last about a couple of weeks and it got real cold for a little while so I gave it up . Here , about the , the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk , uh , Walk around . Because they 're enclosed and no matter what the weather is they can walk -- Right . -- at a pretty good clip and , and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter . Right , I 've noticed people doing that down here , too . I 'll be in town or something 

and people will walk around the mall . 

And it 's safe . It , it is fairly safe . That 's , uh , you know , inside the mall may be not safe going to the parking garage . Yeah , certain parts of it . I know a doctor once told me it , it , a friend of mine , uh , suggested swimming -- Right . -- as being the best exercise there is . Right , I used to do a lot of swimming , we have , we have a swimming pool , but it 's an old concrete pool . We 've been having trouble with it the past few years , so we have n't got to use it much , but I love to swim and water ski and stuff like that . The , uh , swimming , they say , uses more muscles than any other exercise with , and the water takes the resistance . Right . Right , and you do n't get the soreness . I 've , I 've done some water exercises , but our pool is not , is not heated so it 's , 

Right , you ca n't do it year round . Summertime only . Right , that 's the way ours is . You do n't go out when it 's twenty some odd degrees , go out to the swimming pool . Oh , no , it 's too cold . Hot tubs are not , uh , not too bad , but . I could deal with a hot tub . Those are nice . So , what part of Mississippi are you from ? I 'm from Laurel . Whereabouts is that ? That 's way down towards the south . Not quite on the coast , but we 're about two hours from the coast . Oh , and you do have cold weather down there ? Yes , ma'am , it , it started about yesterday , I believe . It started raining and got real cold . Ours started Thanksgiving . Oh . And , uh , from there just , well , today was pretty , but , uh , oh , Sunday the snow and ice came in . Right . And , uh , there was no exercise .
