Well , do you have any pets ? Yes I do . I have a dog named Grisly , who 's a ten year old , uh , mixed breed between Golden Retriever , Afghan Hound and Chow . Oh . And I have a pair of box turtles . Oh , I used to have box turtles , um , well , years ago , when I was growing up -- Yeah , -- I , I really like them . Oh , yeah , I do , too . Lucky and Spot , that 's their names -- Oh . -- and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room , and my dog thinks he 's a mother turtle , and always has his nose all around my turtle box , so do you have any pets now ? Yes , um , we have one dog , a Bichon Frise . Um , our friends in Houston bred the dogs . I had never heard of them -- No , I have n't either . -- they 're , um , they 're all white and they 're small , and , um , and fluffy , they do n't shed . I guess they 're distantly related to a poodle , but they 're not very well known in this country , and they 're not , um , high strung or over bred -- Oh . 

-- um . And how big do they get . Ours is , uh , on the small end , and she 's about ten pounds , and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds -- Oh , that 's interesting . -- and they love people , um , and kids and that was something we were looking for , um , our , our love is Golden Retrievers , and that 's what we had intended to get in Houston , but we had a small yard and a pool and knowing how they love to dig -- Ye- , the water , yes . -- and love the water , um , and we thought that was kind of a tough climate -- Yeah . -- so , uh , we ended up getting this , and , uh , my son would rather have a Golden Retriever , though , I think -- Oh . -- now he wants a , a good size dog . Uh-huh , well , we 've got a good size dog , and we were considering getting a puppy , a small house , lap top dog for him , because he likes other animals and for me , because we used to have a miniature Dachshund , and I miss -- 

Oh . -- having a little one -- Yeah . -- you know , around . 

The kind you have sounds very interesting , though . Well , they really are , um , they 're really sweet dogs . We 've , uh , we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of , um , the family that had them and , and bred them . They had five litters of puppies , and -- Oh . -- and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood -- Uh-huh . -- because , um , And how do you spell that breed ? It 's B I C H O N F R I S E . F R I S E . And how do you pronounce that ? Bichon Frise . Okay . I 'm writing it out phonetically , Yeah . They 're , uh , and they do n't shed so they 're , they 're good dogs for people with , with -- Yes , -- allergies , and they love people , and they 're , Do they bark a lot ? Um , no , not really . 

Ours , um , ours barks more than , um , than some , because she spent a lot of time at our friends ' house . We used to swap back and forth dogs . MUMBLEx they have three dogs . They had a Cockapoo , and , and two Bichons -- Uh-huh . -- um , and she did n't bark at all until she spent time there -- Oh . -- and , uh , now it 's funny . She 's , she 's a good watch dog -- Uh-huh . -- and if there 's , she 'll bark that way , but she also talks a lot , 

she -- Yes . -- um , has a definite personality and so , if we 're leaving her , she barks at us , because -- Oh . -- she does n't want to be left . Um . Does she ever mess in the house ? No , no , and they 're , um , they 're very smart dogs . The circuses in Europe used to use them -- Oh . -- um , for the acts . They , uh , oh , they 'll dance -- Uh-huh . -- on their hind legs each -- Oh , gee . -- um , but they 're very easy to train -- Uh-huh . -- and , And about how much are they ? Well , they range , I 'd noticed up here they 're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper . They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars , I think -- And how about the , -- which I thought was a lot . And how about the person in , uh , Houston ? Well , she 's no longer breeding them -- Oh . -- but , um , because her dogs , um , the , the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter , and , uh , the one male that she used had a tooth problem -- Uh-huh . -- and so she only bred that dog once because it had -- Oh , yes . -- the tooth problem , and did them strictly as , um , pets , you know -- Just pets , -- they were n't , were n't show quality . 

Yes , that 's what we 'd rather have is just a pet , instead of -- Ri- , -- we used to show Saint Bernards when I was a little girl . We did that every weekend , Oh , but , yeah , takes a lot of time . Yes , and it 's very expensive . Yeah , um , but she might have some contacts here , I know origina- , I know that the dog 's grandmother , um , was from Plano , Oh , that 's where I live , Oh , that 's where I live , too . Yeah , I 'm at Coit and Legacy ...
