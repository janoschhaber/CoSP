So , how do you feel about capital punishment ? Well , I , I 'm not really certain how I , uh , I 'm not certain that , that it does a lot of good . I mean , that it ends up , ends up effectively , uh , uh , uh , avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment -- Right , you do n't think , -- penalties . Yet , on the other hand , uh , I do n't know , I mean , there is things that seems like it 's , it 's , it 's the right thing to do . Now , you know , I mean somebody , a s , s , serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns , you know , fifty , fifty children in a school yard , you kind of , I do n't know . What about yourself ? I , uh , I have the same dilemma , I think . Uh , it 's , you know , it seems right sometimes and then other times , you do n't know . Uh-huh . Uh , I mean , people , like , I , it 's been , I mean , like the Arab societies and stuff end up , uh , having e , effective , effective punishments and , and they 're extremely severe . Uh , I , you know , I think to a certain degree , the reason that it , it does n't serve as a deterrent , uh , may be because y- , you never know if it 's going to be a , applied . Right , un- , unlike , uh , like in , in Arab societies . If you get , get caught stealing , they chop off your hand and -- Right . -- and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand and everybody knows exactly what , what for . Right . Uh , and , you know , and here , with our court system and , and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can , you can kind of always count on the fact , or , or there is a good chance you 're going to get off . Uh-huh . And also , it does n't seem like it does that many harm , I mean , sure , their life is taken , but they 'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway , so -- -- I think sometimes they 'd prefer just to get it over with so it 's more of the easy way out than -- some people , -- making them pay for the con- , for the -- Yeah . -- you know , what they 've done . Except that , I mean , the , the average cost to si- , to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is , is extremely high . I mean , something , I , I was amazed at . Uh , uh , per year , it 's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year . Yeah . To keep people in jail . Uh , you know , and it 's sort of a , sort of a crass perspective -- Uh-huh . -- on the usage of capital punishment , but on the other hand , uh , uh , you know , I do n't , I do n't know if it 's that is , that is that serious that they 're really never going to be out of jail , uh ... Right , but then again , also , you ca n't bring back lives that have been taken anyway , so -- Uh-huh . -- uh , it 's , it does n't , it seems by , that by , I do n't know , does n't ever really , p- , uh ... Oh , I know , I mean , you ca n't , it does n't , Yeah . Taking , taking one more life does n't , does n't , does n't re- , get things back the way they were , right . 

Right . It does n't bring back every , Yeah , I do n't know , I , I do n't , I really do n't know , uh , What state are you in ? I 'm in Texas . Oh , really ? W- , w- , In Dallas ? No , I 'm in Austin . Oh , really ? Where , where are you calling from ? Uh , right now I 'm in Utah , but I 'm from Plano , Texas . Oh , I see , uh-huh . So , uh , uh , what are the laws like in Texas ? It 's , Texas is , has , is one of the , one of the s- , well , I guess there is more and more states that are , that are going back to capital punishment . Uh , Texas has had it for a while . It 's one of the quickest , it , it , once it was , it was reallowed , 

I think it was outlawed for a while , but , uh , by the supreme court , I mean , or , the interpretation of the constitution 

and it seems like everybody stopped and then , and then once they sort of reallowed it , Texas was one of the first to , uh , to actually , uh , implement it again . Oh , really ? They do it by , uh , by , do it by lethal injection . Uh-huh . Uh , I 'm originally from Kansas and in Kansas also , uh , they , they almost immediately put back capital punishment and , uh , there they do it by hanging . Wow . Still , uh , they have , I still remember the , the , the movie , uh , IN COLD BLOOD . I do n't know if you 've ever , I 'm sure you 're familiar with it , but , have you seen the movie ? I have n't , no . Yeah . That way . 

And they do it that way ? Yeah , well , they , they show it , not , not , I mean , the , the movie was made in , like , nineteen sixty-two or something like that -- Huh . -- and so it 's , uh , it 's not particularly graphic , but on the other hand it 's , it 's fairly impressive to watch them , you know , walk into the room with gallows . It 's kind of a barn like structure . Wow . I think they 're there , I think that capital punishment is , is , uh , in t- , in Utah also . I 'm not really familiar . Is that right ? Are you there in school ? Yeah , I am . Yeah . So , but I think they d- , a long time ago , I , I remember my dad was telling me this , I think , that , uh , they do it by , like , a bunch of men have guns and one of them has the real gun in it . Uh-huh , 

has , has a , yeah . So they do n't know who killed , 

Has a real bullets and the rest of them have blanks ? Right . Yeah , I , I certainly would n't want to be the executioner , I know that . Yeah , no . I 've always said that if I , if I had to kill and clean and do my own , my own meat , I think I 'd become a vegetarian . . I know . As long as you 're sort of safely removed from it , it seems , seems not so , so bad , I guess .
