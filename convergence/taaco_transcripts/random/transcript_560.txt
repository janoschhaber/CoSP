Before the one will take , uh , okay , let 's see , I guess , uh , I can start . I 'm actually , we 're actually trying to find one now because -- Are you really ? -- our family 's growing . Yeah . Uh , so I 'm looking at , uh , something larger than what we have . We 've got , like , an eighty-four Charger that 's about gone and a , uh , an eighty-nine Horizon . So , I 'm looking for something , uh , littler -- Uh-huh , which are both kind of small . -- bigger , yeah . Uh , so we were thinking mini van for a while and , uh , we 're looking at , uh , some just four door , five passenger sedans -- Uh-huh . -- as well . Are you looking for an American car or , you open to buying foreign cars ? Uh , I do n't really have a preference either way I guess . Uh-huh . You know , it 's , you know , it , I guess the American cars had a bad reputation but -- Uh-huh . -- I have n't had any real substantial problems with the -- Right . -- ones I 've had . Personally , I have a Japanese car right now , and I really like it a lot . Uh , I think the Japanese really build good cars -- Uh-huh . 

-- and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole , uh , you know , buy American , keep American auto workers working right now , but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our , uh , car manufacturers have for a while . Yeah . If I were to buy another car , I would be , uh , I would be partial to buying another Japanese car , but I would also look at American cars , but when I bought the car that I bought now , I did that also and I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product . Yeah , I mean , e- , -- So , if I were , -- even if it 's just details , it seems like , uh -- Right . -- they , you know , I j- , there 's a door seal that s , does n't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while . It 's clearly just a , a design problem there . Right , it is . Uh , I 'm kind of , right now , the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car . I would really like to have a sports car . Uh , I do n't really , I do n't have a family , 

so I do n't need a , a mini van or such to , uh , haul people around in . Uh-huh . So I 'm looking for more a , a two passenger car that , uh , Oh , like a Miata or something like that ? Well , I like the Miata , but I do n't like it enough to buy it . I would buy something , actually the , the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon , which is an American car . Um . But , uh , something along that lines . Interesting . Uh , because I have a , an economy car right now , which is okay , but -- Yeah . -- uh , I think I , I 'd like to move on to something a little better . That 's interesting . Yeah , I guess probably the factors we 'd use to compare are a little different because I look for , you know , size and -- Right . -- safety , and then mileage . Probably , Right . Uh , That 's , when I bought the car that I bought , I was looking for mileage , and I was looking for , uh , dependability and something that was going to last a long time . I was g , that I would get a , for the money that I was going to spend , that I would get a return that was , that was worth that money . Yeah . So , Yeah I c- , I think in terms of computer terminology , I look at , you know , price performance and things like that . Right , exactly . And then a little bit at life expectancy , I guess , but it , you know -- Yeah . -- depends on what you , what you pay initially . But , you know -- That 's right . -- I 've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger . Actually -- Uh-huh . -- it was my wife 's car that she brought into the marriage and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton . Uh-huh . It 's , you know , we , we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles , but -- Uh-huh . -- uh , the other ninety four thousand have been just fine , 

with it , so , Okay . But , uh , Uh , I 've had , uh , I 've had one or two American cars I think , and , and they were okay . I had a Pontiac once and , and I never had a problem with it , but , uh , my mother had a Dodge at one point and I , I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that it , that I would buy a Dodge -- Um . -- j- , just from , well , actually , I had a , uh , a Dodge Omni at one point -- Uh-huh . -- and that was , I think , what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality , uh , car . Yeah . So , I guess you 'd have to say , if I was looking , I would definitely be looking for a foreign car . That 's interesting . But , yeah , it , it 's hard to beat some of the , uh , like , I guess , in particular , we 're looking at a , like a ninety-one Corsica , uh , buy back at a , they say G M sponsored auction , but I think they 're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that -- 

Uh-huh . -- they can sell it back to G M after , you know , it 's , after they 've used it for six months and put -- Right . -- you know , twelve or fifteen thousand miles , on it and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you , Which is a good deal . Yeah , because I guess , uh , I mean , well , ninety-twos , granted , but the new ones , you know -- Uh-huh . -- fourteen to sixteen is what they go for -- Right . -- on the lot , so all the depreciation has been taken off and , s- , the dealer comes out okay -- 

Yeah that , -- you know , I do n't know what kind of , I do n't know what G M corporate , kind of hit the , I do n't know what kind of hit they take on it , but sounds like everybody 's had their chance to make their money off it and , Yeah , I 'm sure they did . So , but , uh , I do n't know , we keep looking at that mini van . It 's just , you know , we can get a , like a Caravan -- Uh-huh . -- for , at twelve , five -- Right . 

-- but that 's a little bit more than we want to spend right now . But , uh , uh , it 's interesting , but , uh , I do n't know , 

if , if , uh , it seems to be ,
