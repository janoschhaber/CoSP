Okay . 

The question was , um , what , what is your opinion of youth , uh , spending a year or two in , in public service . I think it would be a great idea . I 'm not sure about requiring it , you know , of people , because people are going , you know , feeling resentful . I do n't know , but I think it would be a great idea . Yeah . Seems like there 's so many kids that do n't have any since of , you know , what they want to be or do or , you know , they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time and we , sure , our country , all countries sure need help so , Huh-uh . Would , uh , would you be more in favor of , uh , you know , like a local , uh , my only experience with it , I was in Central America for a while , Huh-uh . and , uh , in San Salvador , in El Salvador , Huh-uh . For instance , everybody had what they called there social year , Oh , really . that they had to put in and basically it was a , uh , repayment for , for , uh , high school education , Huh-uh . and most of them joined the Red Cross and it was done internally . I just , there was very little external . I think possibly what , uh , they 're thinking about here , more external Peace Corps , Yeah . Type things where we 're sending people off shore . Well , I think that would be real interesting for people to do , but , I guess , my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them , you know , to other countries , Huh-uh . and , but , I do n't know . If you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they would n't be able to really , you know , send children to do that . Yeah . I did n't know . I do n't , I do n't know how the Peace Corps works , I , guess I was of age when the Peace Corps came in , Yeah , I was too . and all that . I thought seriously about joining at that time , 

I thought it was a fantastic idea . Did you ever get any information on it like , I sent off for stuff on it , but I do n't remember that much . about it . I know that they trained you in the language and , um , That 's what I was wondering about was whether they actually , You actually got paid too , while in the Peace Corps , it was n't much , Yeah . but I guess , they , you could put some money aside while you were there , your expenses and , Was n't Jimmy Carter 's mama that was in the Peace Corps ? Yeah , I think so , yeah , yeah .  But it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a , and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here , and take them to some other country that had different moral values , like Saudi Arabia where they could n't drink . Where they could n't do that . Yeah , you might end up with a revolution . I do n't know which end though . Really . Yeah , yeah . That 's , that 's been interesting , though , the kids that have been over , you know , coming back right now , you know . 

Yeah . 

You wonder if being exposed to that for a while , what percentage of them would actually say , Hey , that 's not a bad way to do it , because from what I understand , from some of the guys I know , you know , crime , uh , is punishable , just almost , uh , instantly and -- Public hanging . -- public , yeah . 

Public hanging and this sort of thing , you know , so you do n't have just a whole lot of , Yeah . what we consider street crimes . Yeah . I 've heard that like in China and stuff , there is virtually no such thing as rape , because if you rape somebody you 'd be murdered , you know , on the , you know , street so , Yeah . Well , I guess that 's , uh , the price of freedom , I guess , is a little , anyway , the , uh , uh , the , the public service thing again I , I , I guess , in my own , having had the whole three or four minutes to , you know , give it a great deal of thought , you know ,  Um , I , I think I agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary , but when you do that then it becomes almost , uh , a MUMBLEx , or it can be , Yeah . 

You know , there have , people will kind of set up their own little club , Yeah , that 's true . And , uh , but if , you know , People that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation , you know , like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that . 

Yeah . Might not go if it was voluntary , but I do n't know how they 'd enforce it , if it was , Yeah , well , if they went AWOL , what are you going to do . Yeah . Shoot them .  Put them in jail . I do n't know . Send them over to Iraq . Yeah , right . Have a vacation in Iraq for a year . I know my dad always talked about , uh , he was in C C C during , uh , Yeah . And he was , uh , a rock rib Iowa type republican and the only good thing he could ever say about , uh , the whole Roosevelt administration was , uh , civilian conservation corps , Huh-uh . because he was in it . He thought that was great . Yeah . The rest of it was all hog wash , but that was great . Well , it seems like it would develop pride , you know , in people , if , if , it 's in their own country . It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them , if it was handled that way . I , I , it would take quite a few people . I think it might build jobs for people , you know , that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that , so maybe that part of it would be helpful too . Yeah . I do n't know . Yeah the only , Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and , Well , you know that brings up the interesting subject too , you know , what would you have , who , who , who would determine what these people do . Yeah , yeah . You know , if , uh , you know , if it 's run by the individual state . You know like C C C was run by the army and in effect , Huh-uh . and the only opposition to it really was that it was , you know , starting some sort of a military elitist type , you know , special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing . Huh-uh . And , uh , when the politics get real confusing , Yeah , really there could be , um , some scandals involved , if , you know , it was n't people that were really fair and le , Yeah . you know , in a legal way or something , they could send all the people over to , uh , you know , one particular part of town or one particular project , that somebody had paid somebody to , you know , get supported , or , Yeah . Well , MUMBLEx . We 've gotten to the point where , you know , if , if , well , if the racial make up of the group was such and such , you know , they 'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and , you know , Yeah . That kind of thing . That could be a complicated too , could n't it . Oh , yeah . Yeah . Suppose , uh , well , you know , they had a group who were construction oriented and they went and they , they built , uh , ca n't think of a good example , a swimming pool , or anything , you know , and one , you can , you can only build it in one place , you know , and know matter where you build it , somebody else is going to scream , well , you did n't build one over here . Yeah . That 's true . Unfair or something , yeah . Yeah . I think , uh , oh , boy .  It 's one of those things on the surface , you know , it seems like a great idea . It 's like a joke I heard once about , uh , elephant foot soup , you know , it 's easy to do once you find a elephant foot . 

 It 's , uh , the logistics of the thing that , uh , Yeah . Really . gets you going . Yeah . Well , it seems like there 's , there 's a lot , you do n't hear much on the news about young people really , you know , wanting to do anything good or anything like that , but you know , I 'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing . I just , I saw on the news the other night that the , uh , the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show , Kisha Knight Pullman , was starting a , I guess now she 's practically a teenager , Yeah . She started some type of , um , national organization for youth to volunteer to teach , tutor other kids to read and , you know , do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards , you know , helpful things , and I know everyone like in the high schools in Dallas , there 's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a , um , minority , you know , I think it was in a Hispanic area , they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers , instead of , they said , all these gangs kids could join to belong . 

Huh-uh . But they did n't have anything positive the kids could be doing , helping , you know , Yeah . so they were trying to start that out , so if there 's people out there that are willing to , you know , kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy . Gosh , we ought to use them . Yeah . You know . If they 're willing to do it . Yeah , it 's , it 's , it 's just the , you know , here you are to the logistics of the thing again , you know . Yeah . Who 's going to run it , you know , what , how , oh , it 's just so many -- Yeah . -- Like , like I said at the beginning I 've got so many connections with people in Central America . My daughter-in-law is Panamanian , you know , Huh-uh . and they have situations like , like that down there . Huh-uh . Where they , they have , these , the social , in some sort of way , if you want to go to school outside the country , and many Salvadorians did , they 'd go to school in Cornell , Iowa , of all places , Huh-uh . and when they came back , they 'd have to serve this , this year , and it turned out to be kind of a joke , 

the ones I knew , you know , always chose the Red Cross , because they did n't do anything -- Oh , I see . -- And they had all kinds of , uh , things they could go into , agricultural , and you know , Yeah . Really good stuff , but , uh , unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that , Red Cross , it was so many of them in it , that at any particular chance , your chance of having to do something was , it was very slim . Yeah . Yeah . And so , Well , we , um , belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , which is like MUMBLEx the Mormon church . Huh-uh . Huh-uh . And , um , there , there is men and also women , women are n't nearly as frequent , and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left , that can volunteer to go on a mission and , um , they 're all over the world . And , it 's incredible logistics , I mean , they have a training center where they teach them , it 's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah , 

and they have , Yeah . to be taught the language and customs and all those kinds of things , and then they , um , you know , go and actually live in that country for the , the , uh , young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months . Okay . Then that 's , uh , kind of a private organization , Right . you know , I 'm , I 'm familiar with , my instructor pilot was a Mormon , he was , he was a good construction , uh , you know , in- , instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible , Oh , yeah .  He had a direct connection somewhere , uh , Yeah , right . He felt that he really had an in so , Yeah . You know , things he would do with an airplane , but any rate that 's off the subject , Yeah . But , I , They , they do n't get paid for it , and , um , but there is funding that comes , they 're supposedly saving up on their own and the church helps them out some , Huh-uh . but , you know , that it is incredible , you know . I see how they were organized in , Yeah . Central and South America and , uh , Yeah . it 's , uh ,
