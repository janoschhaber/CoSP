Okay , what kind of house do you live in ? Well , uh , we live in a , a brick home in far north Dallas and it 's , uh , four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back 

and , Uh-huh . It 's about thirty-five hundred square feet . Well , it sounds like ours are pretty similar . I live in one , I do n't have a swimming pool . And mine 's about twenty-seven hundred square foot . Yeah . But the four bedrooms and all the rest of it sounds just about , about alike . I think it 's pretty much typical for this area . It is . Have you been living there very long ? I 've been in the house I 'm in here right now about twelve and a half years . So you 've been there longer . We built this one about , uh , it 's been , let 's see , it 's been six years -- Uh-huh . -- six and a half years ago , and we subcontracted it out ourselves . We bought -- Oh , really ? -- the lot and , uh , had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications -- Uh-huh . -- and then we subbed it out , so , we 've been here a little over six years now . And -- Uh-huh . -- uh , have really enjoyed it because -- Well , I bet you , -- we built what we wanted to have to live in . Uh-huh . My husband got his big garage . He ha- , we have a three car garage , that he has a big work area in -- Uh-huh . -- and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and , so he has all the work space he needs . Well , that sounds interesting . I bet he 's enjoyed having it that way -- He , -- because some- , kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications . It is , and that 's why we decided to build . We looked -- Uh-huh . 

-- at things that were already , uh , built and the garages were always , if the house w- , was large , it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is -- Well , then , most -- -- what we have . 

-- of them do n't have a three car garage . Uh-huh . They 're kind of rare . So we put a three car garage in . Uh-huh . 

But , even if they had three car garages , they did n't have a work space . All of it was taken up with just car space . Uh-huh . And so he has a big landing area that 's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts -- Uh-huh . -- that he can work on . Well that , my , we 've just got a two car garage , but my husband 's got a big space in between the , where the cars are and the house , where he has a big work shop , you know , workbench and everything . Well , sounds like our husbands have similar interests . Now , mine does not work on cars , he just piddles on this and that . Oh , I see . But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his , his piddling things . Uh-huh . Well , that 's nice that it 's not in your house . It really is . Uh-huh . Because , you know , they have a lot of things of their own , and I , you know , I would n't mind having , and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left , a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and -- 

Uh-huh . -- sewing machine and all that kind of stuff , but I , someone , I do n't know , it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something . Right . So I did n't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would . Well , we still have a , a son and daughter in college that come home . Uh-huh . And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband 's family come . His parents come and also the kids have friends who come -- Uh-huh . -- and stay and so -- Uh-huh . -- it seems like it 's always used as a bedroom . Well , I still , all three of my daughters are married , but , I do n't know , I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time . Right . And some of them coming back home and things , you know . Oh , I understand . And we 've got grandchildren now , 

so -- Well , we , -- when they come , they have to have a place . That 's true and you do n't want them to not be able to come because there 's no room . That 's right , you sure do n't . At times I keep thinking , though , that might be kind of nice . Well , I c- , I have n't reached that point yet . I 've heard people say that . But , uh , my middle son is engaged , my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while . Uh-huh . He 's out of college -- Uh-huh . -- and has a good job , so he could afford to get married -- 

Uh-huh . -- but , is not engaged yet , and my daughter 's been going with the same boy for a while , but she 's still in college and we 're just as happy for her to finish -- Uh-huh . -- her education first . That 's -- Well , I do n't blame you for that . -- what she plans to do . So , I hope so . Well , I have the three girls and then we ended up with four grandsons . Oh , ho-ho . And little boys are around the house -- A whole new world . -- a whole lot more than girls . Uh-huh . And , uh , I enjoy them coming , but for short doses . I can understand . It feels , after they 've been here ten minutes , they have already explored the entire house , they know everything . Uh-huh . But , they 're fun . So you 're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute . Well , I just watch them . Yeah . I d- , I never did put things up when my kids were little and I have n't with them . I try to teach them not to get into things . Well , that 's the same thing that I did . I hope I 'll be able to do the same with grandchildren . I think that once you do that , your children kind of develop the same attitudes . At least my daughters have . They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up . So it 's worked pretty well . There 's , I do n't really think anything 's been broken . Every now and then we have to kind of go and say , now do n't bother this , you know . Um , uh-huh . But , all in all , they mind pretty well . But , I guess most of the hou- , d- , what kind of roof does your house have ? Here I 'm getting off the subject . Well , we have ,
