Okay , um , I do n't know about you but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like every day . I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next .  It 's pretty bad , but it 's true , you know , they tend to try to be , you know , real lax and supposedly the policy is like , you know , we , you know , we , hire these wonderful creative people and we do n't want to smush their creativity , you know . We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want . And , you know , you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next . Well , I 'm kind of that way too . I work in the legal department 

and where we are now , what we 're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents . Yeah . And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day , it always seems like I 'm doing that and I ca n't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry , you know , boxes of documents around , so , if I 'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing , you know , odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents , I dress down . But if we 're going to have a meeting , where we 're having the attorneys come in , or people from , uh , other party 's attorneys and stuff , then I normally dress up . Yeah , and I 'll wear a dress and hose and stuff . Yeah , you know , we 're kind of that way too . I try to , I 'm the same way you are , I kind of try to judge from day to day . I know , you know , where I am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and , Uh-huh . and , you know , if I know that they 're going to be there , you know , you , I try to really watch it and like you say , you know , really dress up and if I know they 're not , you know , I , I 've been doing a lot of reorganization , you know , the last couple of months the same way you are , you know , Uh-huh . and it 's just MUMBLEx , it 's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress . That 's right , that 's right . It is and so , 

As a matter of fact , I thought I had one funny story when , uh , I was at T I the first year or so , we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes . We had them in the warehouse , Uh . and at that point , it , the warehouse was over across the road and it was n't air conditioned , and , it , we were there like in the middle of the summer , it 's unair-conditioned , it was dusty and dirty , uh , 

there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it . And so , we did n't really know we were n't supposed to , we thought T I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job , Uh-huh . we wore shorts . We did n't know that was a big no , no . Oh no . And the supervisor from another area came up to us and , you know , this area where record retention is , there 's only a few people that work there , and he , sho- , he knew who worked there , he should have realized that we were n't regulars in the warehouse there . And he came up to us and he just said , who 's your supervisor . Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor , and our supervisor 's supervisor , and it went up all the way to the head of facilities , Oh no . complaining that we were wearing shorts . He did n't at , at least say to us , did you know you 're not supposed to do that . That could have alleviated a big problem . We ended up getting called out on it . Oh , how awful . It sounds like Mister Power Hungry . Yeah . You know , just yesterday , though , I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts . Uh-huh . And I do n't care , you can call them split skirts and you can call them culottes all you want but these were shorts . That 's all they were .  I do n't care what else you call them , you know , if they 're below the knee , okay , maybe you can call them split skirts . If they 're above the knee they turn into shorts , you know .  And these were n't even really full ones . I mean they had a problem out here with it last summer , wearing these shorts that were , you know , the real wide full ones , you know , and becau- , these were n't even those . These were like pretty short , black , and they were very dressy , the were black velvet shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very , very nice . Um . But , you do n't wear shorts to work . You know , I mean , MUMBLEx as far as I 'm considered , she was in violation and nobody says anything to them . It 's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime . Um . You know , if they just , you know , the management does n't ever seem to want to take an , cut off , you know , that no , this is wear we 're going to draw the line . This is shorts , you know . Yeah . And , and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that , you know , Um . so , it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going , well God , we have a pair of those at home too . It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear , you know , but . Well I 've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine . Yeah . And they have said no . Yeah and then during the week you see these women , in the you know , just because you put on a pair of hose with them does n't make them not shorts anymore , you know . Yeah . I mean I 've never seen them do it without hose , I mean they always have hose on , but still , it 's , they 're shorts , I do n't care what you say , they 're shorts .  Well I think T I 's dress code is pretty lax considering everything , anyway , you know , uh . I know , I did n't know that E D S has a very strict dress code , I had a friend , Oh do they really ? Oh definitely . I had a friend who worked there for a year or so and they spell it out . For men it 's particular suits , uh , the pin stripe , and the particular colors of shirts and win- , wing tipped shoes . Oh , my God . Oh , it is definitely lined out . Women are not allowed to wear slacks , 

you wear coordinated suits . I coul , I could n't afford to work there . And , and a particular kind of shoe , you know , so high heel , oh it is spelled out . Oh , no . When I was looking at her materials when she first started , you know , she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff . Uh-huh . 

And it told about the dress code and it said , these are the color pastel shirts you may wear , or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and , hair just this way . T I -s says no shorts and no halters . I know , that 's it . Yeah , and E D S is very particular about this , hair cuts , Wow . I mean it was like you ca n't have , you know , such and such facial hair , no beards , you know , and just really detailed . I do n't know that that would be a good environment to work in . I mean , I see , I , I am more , I do n't know about anybody else , and a lot of bosses may say I 'm nuts , 

but I am more productive when I 'm in pants .  I , I am . I work faster , I get things done faster , than when I 'm in a dress and heels , you know , I , and it 's weird but I , it 's I do , I can , I can get so much more done if I 'm dressed comfortable , you know . Well the , the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had , uh , another person coming from Washington , our outside counsel . And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse 

but she really did n't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse , but the warehouse . Right . And she came with skirts , just like she 'd be going into the office . Yeah . And we 'd try , we 'd try to say , did n't you bring any pants or anything . We 're , we 're out here in the warehouse , you know , you , you got your skid of , you know , that wooden pallet of boxes . Uh-huh . and you 're going to have un , unload you skid look at the documents in the , in the boxes and then repack your skid . And she , You ca n't do that in a skirt poor soul . And she was so , she was so hot and miserable , you know , in the skirt . Oh yuck . She finally tried to go buy , you know , a pair of pants but , you know , I mean it was just completely miserable for her . Yeah , that 's terrible , that 's terrible gosh .  Well I do n't know , I just figure , you know , yeah , sometimes I worry about , you know , if I go in in pants , 

and I never , I never ever , ever , ever go in in a pair of jeans , you know . 

But I 'll go in in pants . I mean today I had on a pair of , you know , navy blue dress slacks and , and , uh , like a peach colored top and , you know , not cruddy , but not a dress either . And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would , will hold you back , you know , if you do n't dress in , you know , your dress for success business suits everyday if , you know , if upper management does n't notice that and remember that later on , but , you know , I do n't know if they do or not . You know , I see a lot of the managers and they 're in jeans , so , you know . Some of our people in the legal department , we have , um , assistants to the general counsel and it 's funny because , there 's one that always wears a suit . A matter of fact , he 's never seen without his jacket to the suit on , buttoned . Really , wow . And then there 's another one who 's , who 's a little younger and a little more yuppish and he 's always kind of like in the khaki pants and , you know , a shirt , Uh-huh . and sometimes he wears the jacket to it . Yeah . And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt . So that 's just , Is n't that funny . 

With the , you know , the little suspenders or something on so . That 's great . We 've , we 've kind of had a variety there but , I think a lot of times it 's , it 's mainly who they 're going to meet with , or they 're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that 's how they are . Yeah . If they 're just going to be meeting with T I -ers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the , they 're engineers that they 're talking too , they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they 're usually casual . That 's the way to do it . I mean that 's the smart way to do it . Yeah . It really is , because you 're making , you know , if when they 're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down , if they come in , in , you know , a six hundred dollar three piece suit , it 's going to make the people they 're meeting with feel very uncomfortable , you know , or it would me , you know . It 's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here . Yeah , yeah , look at this slick guy , I wonder what kind of money does he make , uh-huh .  I can see it now . Well it was good to talk to you . It was really enjoyable . Yeah , this is , this is kind of a fun project . It really is . I 've done some of the other speech programs , but we 've never got to talk to another person , it was always just talking to the computer . Oh , yuck , yeah . So this is a little different . Well it 's kind of enjoyable , I 'm really looking forward to it . Yeah . Well thanks a lot . Okay , bye . Bye-bye .
