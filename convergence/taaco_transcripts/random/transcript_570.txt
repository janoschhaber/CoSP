Yeah , Jonathan , uh , you s , you say it 's near and dear to your heart . Buying a car is , uh , something you 're contemplating , I take it . Uh , fantasizing about . Uh . Ca n't do it right now . Our situation is that we 're a two car family -- Uh-huh . -- and I have a mini van we bought a few years ago . Uh . It 's got a , uh , five year loan , so that 's still got a couple years to run -- Uh-huh . -- and the car I get to drive is a , uh , Nissan Sentra that 's going to be ten years old next month so , 

I think -- -- about , uh , sprucing that up in a couple years if I can . Uh-huh . What do you think you 'll , uh , what kind of a car do you think you 'll buy next ? Well , since I just turned forty , I 'm thinking about a forty year old man 's car , something , uh , something real sporty -- 

Uh-huh . -- but , uh , realistically with , uh , the need to take the kids to school , probably have to have something that , uh , would n't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat . Uh-huh . Something a little seating room . How about you ? Well , I think the next car we get will probably be a , well I , I like Buicks . We have a Buick Century now , 

it 's a nineteen eighty-seven -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , whatever I get , I want to have , uh , air bags , uh , both driver 's and passenger side and four door because it 's much more convenient if you 're carrying anybody to , you know , rather than have them stoop down to get over , so -- Sure . -- I think the four door is probably a major requirement and , other than that , uh , you know , reasonable cost and safety and , uh , as much economy as you can get out of a car . Uh , you know , I 'm not looking for one with a great big engine , uh -- Sure . -- something that will carry it around careful , I guess is best , best way to describe it . Right now , we 've got a V six and it , that seems to be just fine . I know they s- , they 're coming out with some V eight now and I think that 's probably a little over kill for this day and age . Yeah , I was surprised to hear that the V eights are coming back , so , they 've got some pretty powerful sixes . Uh-huh . And , uh , you know , V eights seem to be a return to the days of , you know , ten or twelve miles a gallon . Right . I , uh , I drive a , a truck , a Ford truck . I , I like trucks because they 're spacious , and it 's handy to haul things . Uh , it 's not related to my business , I just really use it , basically , for transportation , but there 's so many occasions when I 've had to move some members of the family or do this or that , and it 's -- Sure . -- it 's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one . Is , uh , traction much of an issue for you up there . Traction ? MUMBLEx . Uh , not really , uh , you know , it 's a two wheel drive truck and I figure if it 's so bad that I need a four wheel drive , I probably ought to be home anyway . Actually , uh , pretty good way of looking at it , yeah . We , uh , we had a small accident with our mini van -- Wow . -- a few years ago . A case where there was a , sort of freak ice storm and we were n't aware of it , and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car , and , this is a rear wheel drive model . So , we got some monster studded snow tires after that . Uh-huh . Have n't had any problems since . What kind of , what make is the mini van ? It 's a Mazda . Mazda , I see . And , uh , we 're pleased with it in terms of comfort , and , uh , driveability . Fuel economy is n't great , being a mini van , but , uh it 's real nice for carrying around our kids and others and -- Right . -- it 's , uh , got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around so we 've been able to do some real creative , uh , load hauling when called upon . One of my sons has a , a Plymouth , uh , van -- Uh-huh . -- or , you know , uh , uh , that same type of thing , the Voyager , I guess -- Right . -- and , uh , they have a , a child that 's five years old and it 's really handy for hauling him around and , and their stuff , 

and , of course , as he gets friends , I 'm sure that will be even handier . So , I know if we were , if we had kids still at home , we 're in our fifties now , but , if we had kids still at home , we 'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value . Yeah , I think that we 're going to be , uh , owning a mini van for some years to come . Probably till the kids are out of , uh , high school anyway . What about , uh , all wheel drive ? Is that something that you 'd be interested in or is that , Uh I 'd be satisfied with a , a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra . Uh-huh . And even as , as light as that is with , uh , the small tires it 's , it 's done pretty well -- Uh-huh . -- in winter , uh , again , like you , if conditions are , are that bad , I probably do n't want to be driving anyway . Right . So I know I 'd be happy with a , a reasonable , uh , four door . You know , again , we 've , we 've got the same issue with getting kids into the ,
