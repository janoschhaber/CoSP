What kind of crime do you think , uh , is the most prevalent in our society ? Oh , boy , probably , uh , robberies , people stealing from each other . Such as New York City ? Is that what happens up there a lot ? Uh , th- , that , that 's mostly what I hear , though , is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen . That 's the most prevalent crime . Uh , the ones that really , you know , the ones that really add up after a while , I guess , you know , from , s- , far as insurance money and stuff like that , insurance costs . You know , everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually . Yeah , I , I , I wonder if , uh , if drug use is a more prevalent crime , though , because , I mean , so many people use it , and even though just using is not really , I mean it is a crime , Oh , well , yeah , that , that , that is a crime . I guess , uh , when you , when you count all the little things that people do like , 

uh , speeding is a crime . Well , that 's true . I break that law every day . But I was , I , I was staying in the realm of , of felonies versus misdemeanors -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , drug use , well , actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor , but , uh , what kind , what kind , have you been , uh , have you been the subject of such a crime , such as stealing , or anything ? Well , I 've , uh , I 've been caught with marijuana before , so I guess that was a crime . I got a year 's probation for that , but , uh , That , that 's not that much . I mean -- No , it was n't that -- -- you know , those are n't , -- big a deal . I , Uh , when I think of crime , I think of stuff that , that affects other people like people getting , you know , killed or raped . I think rape is one of the worst crimes . Yeah , I think it is . I , in some ways , it 's almost worse than murder . 

Yeah , it 's very degrading -- Uh , Murder , murder is , is hard on the people that were related to -- -- you know , I mean , it is a rather final solution , though . Yeah , right , once , once a person 's , you know , gone , then it 's , but the person that 's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life , you know . Yes . What , what do you think is , uh , is an appropriate , uh , punishment for some of the various , you know , such as , things such as rape or , or , uh , murder -- Well -- -- or something like that . -- for , for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders , I think the death penalty is , it 's a pretty good thing . I agree with that . They , they have that down here in Florida still . They the electric chair and , uh , Yeah , I think Virginia does , too , up here . Oh , do they ? Yeah , I think , I think that 's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy 

and , I guess usually they 're , they 're always sure they got the right guy , but , uh , Yeah , I think the appeal process takes too long . Yeah , so do I . I think , I , I think it should take , from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year . Yeah , i- , if that . You know , the sooner , a , a , a year 's plenty of time -- Uh-huh . -- you know , for something to come out , I guess . Then , you know , there 's been guys in jail for six years and the other guy admits that he did it and they , it 's like oops , . Well , yeah , I mean , the system is n't perfect , I mean , it 's run by a bunch of imperfect humans . You do the best you can to make it perfect , you know , you , you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect . Right . But , I think you have to accept some of the errors . I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if , if there was a credible punishment , uh , for murderers . Um , yeah , I do n't know if it would or not though . I , I do n't think it 's a , so much of a deterrent as , as it is a , a good , uh , a good way for vengeance , you know , for the relatives and , and family members , you know what I mean ? And society probably , too . 

Yeah . I mean , just general society to , Yeah , 

it kind of gets -- Uh , -- it off their chest . Yeah , it does and , and it decreases the prison population . And , which is -- Yeah , I know that -- -- significant -- -- a , a lot of the -- -- I mean , -- lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other . And they 're -- Yeah . -- the , kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that . I do n't think you 'll ever stop all that stuff dead , but , I , y- , y- , you might be able to , uh , stop people , you know , they 're thinking about it , they know they 're going to get the chair if they get caught . Yeah , generally the crimes of passion and things like that , uh , are not premeditated . Right . I mean , they can be , but usually they are n't . Yeah . They 're spur of the moment -- That 's right . 

-- and , uh , the premeditated murders , the ones where the person plots and plans , when you catch those , those individuals , I think that you , you end up with a , uh , uh , how do I want to , you end up with a s- , you end up with someone who 's more dangerous to society -- Yeah . -- because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time . Yeah , they could p- , probably do it again . Yes , they , they would have no problems doing it again . That 's right , they did n't have any time doing it the first time . Uh-huh . And I think locking them up for , you know , fifty years does n't do a , any good because -- No , it do , -- as a , as a taxpayer , I 'm going to pay , you know , one and a ,
