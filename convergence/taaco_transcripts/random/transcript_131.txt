Well , I have n't heard anything about the proposal myself , 

but , uh , No , I have n't either . Uh , I do n't know if it 's their proposal or one that 's being seriously kicked around . I 've , I 've always felt for a long time that I , I think that all young kids ought to do a stint , uh , primarily in the military . Yeah . Uh . Most countries require that now , they -- Yeah , yeah . -- you know , they have , uh , it mandatory for , for the , the uh -- Uh-huh . -- at least the young men , I do n't know about the young women , I do n't know if they have to serve in the military , Yeah , a lot , yeah , well , you take Israel -- too . -- I mean , everybody does . Yeah . I do n't think it 's a bad idea , teaches , teaches a lot . I mean , I went in the service when I was eighteen , Uh-huh . And , uh , stayed in for ten years . Is that right ? Yeah , uh , did a lot of growing up . I bet .  You have to . Yeah . Yeah , my father had been in the military . I did n't do it myself . My father had and that 's , uh , how he put himself through school basically . Yeah . He came from a poor immigrant family , and he did n't have a chance to , uh , you know , the family was n't wealthy , so he had to do something to , Do it himself . put himself through school , and he did . And he was very successful . Well , my parents wanted to send me to college , and I was dead set against it .  You know , I had wanderlust , you know . 

Yeah . And I got in , and after , after wasting the first six years , partying and everything else , I decided , uh-huh , time to settle down and do something . So I started to work on my education . Yeah . Course my job was such that I did n't , I could n't do it as much as I wanted -- Uh-huh . -- and still I ended up going two semesters when I got out just to get my degree . That 's pretty good . But , I 've been in school ever since . That 's good . Yeah , I guess . Yeah , 

that 's , uh , I do n't know . There 's other kinds of service to the country that could be done , you know , Yeah , I mean if you do n't like , I mean , working in the national parks , Sure . Uh , working , clean up the roadsides -- Exactly . -- I mean , I 've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time , Oh yeah , absol- , not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job , but at least some of their time to look for , to go out and clean up the roads . Absolutely . You know , I mean , All these , all this money that we 're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we 're paying all these welfare recipients , and if they 're able-bodied people , I do n't see any problem at all with having them go out there and , and , if nothing else , get a group of them together and take them around to old folks -- Yeah . -- places and let them cut the yards , paint the houses . Yeah , we 'd learn service to other people -- Sure , sure . -- in this country . So I 'm , get something out of that money . Country would benefit , Yeah I 've , I mean , uh , yeah , yeah , my next door neighbor when I was growing up , worked for the unemployment division , and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied and , That right . Yeah , and he , he had all kinds of horror stories . You know , these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks , and , back , back in those days they also use to give you , uh , booklets good for , uh , clothing and gas , and things like this . Yeah . They get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games -- Yeah . -- you know , and I 'm , I jus- , I have a hard time dealing with that . What I hear one time , I think it was on Paul Harvey 's , uh , radio segment , that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy , each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars . Uh-huh . I mean , I was astounded . 

I do n't even make that . No , I know . I , you , you think about , you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient , Yeah , and somebody 's taking that away . and , and there 's probably , there 's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy . Yeah , no doubt . You know , it 's , it 's , it 's totally ridiculous , and now , I , I , I , uh , started out when I first got in graduate school I was going into public administration , and , uh , quite honestly I just got so fed up with it I just could n't stand it any more . Is that right , Yeah , I mean , this is the kind of thing you look at . Yeah . You sit there and when you 're writing up budgets , you wonder , okay , how much money do we need . Well , you need X number dollars for the recipients but you need X number dollars to administer the program . Well just ridiculous . Yeah . This is ridiculous . 

It 's sad . It is , it 's pathetic . I mean , there 's got to be a different way . There 's got to be a better way . But it 'll never happen . 

I mean , these -- Yeah . 

-- these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks . Yeah . What would happen if the MUMBLEx required young people to do service to the country , what should they get in return , I wonder . Like , uh , I think , I think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as , uh , and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance . Yeah . Give an incentive . 

Educational or vocational training or something . Yeah . Something that 's going to help them along the way . And they 'll help the country eventually , too , Sure , I mean , because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people , Well , this , I mean -- and that 's only going to help . -- I mean , look at the statistics , I mean , it 's sad . One in five Americans ca n't read -- Yeah . -- adults , that is , ca n't even read . And , and we 've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math . Yeah . I mean , what are we , what are we becoming ? We 're becoming a service country . As opposed to what we were twenty years ago . 

Yeah , we were an industrial giant , and now we 're no- , we 're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game . We taught them how to do it , and they , they did it better than we do . Yeah Simple as that . because they have the ambition , I guess . yeah , simple as that . Yeah , which is good for them , but on the other hand , we kind of lose out . Yeah , it 's terrible for us . I think that if , uh , young people had service to the country might give them more ambition . 

Yeah . Because they learn that serving other people is a good thing . Yeah , and , and it can be good for them , too . Yeah , oh yeah . I mean , even , even the greedy kids that we 've got now ... Oh god , you go to the mall and you see , you know , fourteen year old kids flaunting money , because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night , you know -- I know . -- for what . I know . Give me the money and I 'll , I 'll teach them something good . Well , you know , you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house . Yeah . Yeah , uh , that 's my other complaint . Parents are n't parents any more . No . They 've , they 've relinquished their parenting . Yeah . One of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble ? Yeah . Well , as a substitute teacher for a year , I , I can say yes . Yeah , I mean , I talked with somebody else about that another time , and , you know , when I 's in graduate school working on my master 's degree in math , I was , uh , teaching as part of my , part of the program . And I just love teaching . That was a lot , that 's probably the most fun I had . And , uh , it helped me out because I learned -- Yeah . -- things and learned how to do things differently . Uh-huh . And when , uh , when come time to get out of school , I thought , Boy , I 'd like to teach . But you know , for , for what . Yeah . 

You know , I do n't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life . Exactly . I mean , that , that 's a sad thing to think , and that 's kind of selfish on my part , and I admit that , Well , in a way it is , but you have to look out for yourself -- Yeah , that 's right . -- you know , I mean , that 's some- , and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers , 

That 's wrong . Yeah , gosh , I mean , I 'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less , I saying teachers should be paid more . 

No , I mean yeah . They do an absolutely necessary job , I mean , I , I have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that . Yeah . But , uh , I mean , there 's , there 's a sense of priorities here , too . Yeah . You know , we need , what 's more important , picking up the garbage or educating our kids . Yeah . They both have their place . Yeah , they , they , sure . But , you know , when it gets right down to it , I mean , one 's import , I mean , on the other hand , I mean , you take a garbage man in New York City starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars . That 's pretty good . Well I bet you there 's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year . Yeah . I mean , my other pet peeve is unions . Yeah , oh yeah . You know , it 's just , it 's , it 's ridiculous the way unions have gone . There was a time when unions were needed . And they served a good function . And they served a good function , but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated , and they 're only there to perpetuate their own , their own power structure . I remember , the company my dad worked for , the people there went on strike against the management . It was a steel manufacturing place , and they , uh , this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap , and they were having a hard time . And they told the strikers there , look , we need you to come back and get this stuff done . Or else we 're going to be out of business . And they would n't come back , so they went bankrupt . Yeah . And , and they all lost their jobs . Sure , and , and -- And it 's like , you know . -- and that 's really what happened to the steel industry in this country . Yeah . So many times , I mean , you had the , uh , the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time . And , well , that took care of that industry -- That 's right . -- and , and , then , and I 'll tell you , Detroit worked awfully hard on , on stopping car manufacturing in this country . And they 're trying to do that now with the imports . Yeah , I mean , you know , we 've never caught up , and I do n't think we ever will . It 'll be a tough road , though . Yeah , I mean , here it is , and we 've got , we 've got to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars . Yeah . You know . And they only did it because they , I guess they were embarrassed -- Yeah . -- that they 're so good at it . That 's about right . Gosh . Yeah , well , back to the original subject , yeah , I think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service , I do n't care what kind it is . It teaches them pride in their country . Yeah , and pride in themselves , too . That 's right . They could , they could , I mean , you could organize something just within your community . Yeah , same old thing . I mean , that 's right . That 's like Eagle Scouts . Sure . Uh-huh . And that 's a great idea . I think they ought to take them and , I do n't know , just have sort of like a , a , a manpower pool and say Okay , look , we need somebody ...
