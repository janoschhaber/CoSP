Okay . 

Um , what type of magazines do you have ? We take several at home . 

I , I take , um , SKIING MAGAZINE , and I take , uh , DISCOVER magazine , and also , uh , C D AND STEREO REVIEW -- Uh-huh . -- and NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , I think -- Oh , MUMBLEx . -- and BOYS LIFE . 

Oh , good . That 's a good one , I like to get . Um , so I take it that you like to ski . Do you , do you , um , receive a lot of information on skiing through the SKI MAGAZINE ? I presume that I do . Uh-huh . Uh , I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth , because I do get things -- Oh . -- from ski associations and things , uh , at , during the year . Oh , uh , and do you receive discounts and things like that , do you think or , Uh , not so much that , I , uh , more likely to see those at a ski show or something , but -- Oh . 

-- um , I just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and , and new equipment that 's come out and so forth . Some fashions -- Oh . -- are always in there too . Uh-huh . So would this vacation you 're taking , did you receive information from your skiing magazine ? Probably not . Uh , we already knew we wanted to take one , and we just started looking around . I may have referred to a couple of them , but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the -- Oh . -- resort information , picked up a lot of brochures -- Oh . -- and just decided to go to Crested Butte . We have n't been there before . Um , that sounds nice . Kind of away from the crowd -- Uh-huh . -- is why we chose that one . It 's -- Oh . -- supposedly low lift lines . But I have n't skied Utah yet , but I want to . Oh , well , you need to come out . I 'd like to go to Sundance and Park City -- Uh-huh . -- and some of those . I understand Deer Valley is nice , too . Deer Valley , uh-huh . Yeah , they are , it 's wonderful snow . Well , how about you , what , what magazines do you have at home ? Uh , I am currently taking DECORATIVE WOODWORKING , and , uh , COUNTRY LIVING , and , let 's see , we do have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , and then we have some church magazines , but I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING . I 'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that , so -- Oh , okay . -- the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a great , great help . Does it have , uh , articles on how to do things -- Uh-huh . -- as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth ? Uh-huh , they do have , uh , mostly they have , uh , the ads on the equipment , but the whole magazine is just filled with , uh , pictures and projects that you can make yourself , and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project , and , and then how to paint it with the tole paintings , and so , it 's really a fun one . I like that . Well , that 's good . It 's good to get use out of one . Uh-huh . 

I 'm not sure that , um , in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , I mean , I read it , but then they just sort of gather dust for a -- Uh-huh . -- long period of time , but then eventually there 'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find -- Uh-huh . -- you know , France or something or whatever it is -- Yeah . -- he 's looking for . Yes . I 've , I 've noticed that , too , but they have been nice to have around . Every once in a while they come in handy . I used to take SMITHSONIAN -- Oh . -- too , I liked that magazine -- Uh-huh . 

-- but it was , I was , just found myself not ever getting around to reading it . Oh . Uh . You get so many coming in , and by the time the next round comes in I 'm still not through reading the first round . Oh , that . Oh , SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house , too , I forgot , and that 's -- Oh . -- mostly my son 's , but -- Uh-huh . -- but I do read it , too . Oh , well that sounds like . And he takes GAMES MAGAZINE -- Uh-huh . -- GAME MAGAZINE , which has puzzles and things -- Oh . -- that he likes to solve , you know , crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that -- Uh-huh . -- he likes to try that , so . He does , uh , does get to be a lot of paper though , after a while -- Uh-huh . -- if you do n't keep them weeded out , they almost take over . They do , they can do that . I found that they 've been fun for my little girls , they 're five and four years old , and they like to go through and , Oh , yeah , they 're just kind of getting started now . Uh-huh . They like to cut the pictures out and paste them on , and so we 've found good use for those . Mine is a senior in high school , so he 's , we 're kind of at the end of that trail . Oh . You 're just -- Oh . -- sort of beginning -- Uh-huh . -- to think about first grade . Yeah , it 's fun . Well , I do have a boy in junior high , too , so -- Oh , okay , so you got a little bit of a gap there between , -- so we 're kind of running the gamut . Yeah .
