Well I wondered if I was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type . Have you been talking to males ? Yeah , yeah , this is , this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female . I was afraid we might get into an argument . Right . Well , uh , I guess uh , there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations , Uh-huh . for , uh , the roles of women and uh , I guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now , Right . And trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities , you know , they may be going to school , or may have elderly parents , or you know all sorts of other things . Yeah , it , it seems too me like though that women 's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore , the women are spreading themselves thinner , Oh , I think so . than before . Absolutely . I , I , I think it 's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days . Uh-huh . Sometimes , I think I am going crazy trying to do it but , Do you work outside the home ? Yes . Do you have children ? Uh , yes . They are getting older now , Uh-huh . so they are not quite as much of a responsibility but they are still there , you know , Oh sure . they still take time , and , and I , you know , I still provide most of the things that go on around the house . Right . So , uh , yeah and for a while I was going to school too , and tha- , it was tough . Yeah , I uh , I think that while it 's a good change for I think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel , you know , Uh-huh . their expertise may be . Uh-huh . Uh , I think sometimes other things suffer and tha- , I think it 's hard to find a balance there . But in some ways I think we are expected to do it all . You 're almost looked down upon if you do n't try to do all of these things and -- Right . -- that 's where the problem is really . Yeah , yeah , I have little children , four and one , and I decided that it was very important to me to stay home . Uh-huh . Uh , and when I , I , I happen to , you know be , I 'm very active with , uh , people , other people with children my age and most of us do tend to stay home , but when I run into people that , you know , just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time , I , there 's almost a , uh , friction between us . Uh-huh . 

Uh-huh , not people that are , you know , necessarily good friends , Yeah . Even though that has happened too , uh , it 's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence . You know w- , if you decide to go back to work then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself . Right . And if you do n't then , sometimes you feel like you 're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you 're just wasting your time , Yeah . at home . Yeah , it 's a tough one . I mean , I 've done some of both . Uh-huh . 

I , when my kids were real little , I was at home for a couple of different periods of time . Uh-huh . Oh , I think the longest was less than a year , but still at least I was able to , to spend , you know , those first months with them . Right . But , uh , I mostly went back to work because I was tired of doing without things . Yeah . You know , the money was the issue . But , uh , even now , I would , I would like to not have to work in some ways . Right . It , it 's kind of pull and tug , Yeah . on the other hand , I ca n't imagine just being at home , uh , although I have a lot of interests and a lot of things I would like to pursue . Uh-huh . Uh , still , uh , there 's , there 's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having , you know , a job and all that goes with that . No , that , that 's definitely true . In fact , I , I work out of my home . Um , I 'm an accountant , Oh . and I do taxes and bookkeeping and I , uh , it was , it 's a way for me to stay home . Uh-huh . And I mean , I still , unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night , Yeah . but , uh , but it , it 's worked out for , for my family , Yeah . to have my cake and eat it too , kind of thing . Yeah , that 's a good deal . Where do you think this is going in the future , I mean , do you think things are going to change , or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this ? Well , I , I hope that they will change uh , but , but I 'm , I just , I know it 's going to be a slow change . Uh , I , I feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner . I mean I 'm just thinking of my circle of people that I know . I know quite a few people who have decided to not have both , both , both , uh , couples , you know , both , uh , of the parents work . Yeah . And yet , uh , I , I we- , I hope to see employer based , you know , helping out . Uh-huh . You know , child , uh , care centers at the place of employment and , and things like that , that will help out . What do you think , do you think we are , 

I do n't , 

setting a trend ? yeah , I , well I see , I think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children . Uh-huh . Uh , and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the , the family things work . Right . Uh , but I do n't know if they 're going to ever give up their careers , you know . 

It 's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are , I do n't know if they want to completely give that up . Right , it 's a very personal thing . But , it would be nice if there could be an in-between , a middle ground somewhere . Yeah . I think it 's hard though when you talk about , about families and , and raising children because ch- , I think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground . I think they , uh , they need security 

and yet they , I do n't know , I , from speaking from my children , the- , they are n't real flexible when it comes to things like that . Yeah . 

They , uh , they want to know things are going to be a certain way . Well , yeah , I think they , they like a routine of sorts . Uh-huh , right . Well , we will see . I , I 'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society . Well , yes , I , I like the fact that , you know , gradually you 're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions , but it 's still a long way from being what it ought to be . Oh , yes , the , the numbers are still very skewed to say the least . Yeah . Okay , well I enjoyed talking to you . Okay , you too Ellen . All right , good-bye . Bye-bye .
