H- , 

well , Myrna , how do you get your news , news ? Uh , most of it is from the radio , uh , Uh-huh . and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon . Yeah . We usually watch the local news and the , the , uh , national news both . Uh-huh , yeah , I 'm pretty much the same . I , uh , I find that , uh , I 'm a graduate student and I , I read a lot for school and I find I have no patience to really read a newspaper because I just , I 'm reading so much all the time . And I really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast . Well you can always get up and leave that . Uh-huh , tha- , tha- , yeah , that 's true . Uh , I d , I just do n't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper . Either by the time I get home from work , Uh-huh . it 's already , you know , time for the news to come on . That 's right , yeah . So , it 's so much easier to sit there and besides , I can be doing other things and still listen to the news . Yeah , that 's right , I , I agree . That 's , a lot of times I eat while I 'm uh , watching the news . Yeah . Yeah , the same thing . Is there any , uh , what did you think about the coverage like over in the , uh , Persian Gulf ? I think they did a great job . Yeah , I thought so too , it was , it , you know , for a while when we were really interested , uh , we saw it all the time . Some of the stations I guess carried it for twenty-four hours for a couple of days there and then , you know , the special reports and the extended news coverage I thought was really good . Uh-huh . Yeah . And you could always find some channel that had something on but you did n't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time . Yeah , right , yeah , just news , that 's right , yeah . Yeah , I noticed that one thing that , that T I did , you know , they had , uh , uh , they used to have , well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings , Uh-huh . and they used to have a program called T News , and just updates of , of different things that were going on within T I . Well when all the , the mess with , uh , uh , in the Persian Gulf came about they started carrying C N N . Oh , yeah . Well now , they have had so much good response from this , Uh-huh . that T I now has C N N on all the time . Huh , well that 's great . So , we can always run upstairs and , you know , Uh-huh . ca , get a quickie update on what 's going on , if we really want to . Yeah , 

or if yo- , you have a break in the middle of the day , you take a coffee break you can always stay informed . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , that 's really good . That 's , um , I 've found that when I , I do n't have cable television anymore , uh , when I moved , went back to graduate school I just did n't have the money to buy , ge , rent a cable T V line , or whatever , you know . 

So I do n't get C N N , uh , which was a big disappointment . I used to watch , that was my , if I was n't home , I 'm a college teacher and sometimes I teach in the evening so I 'll miss the evening news . And uh , you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on C N N . I think that 's , Yes . that really has changed the way , uh , I look at the news . Yeah , we do n't get it either , we live out in the country , Uh-huh . and we just do n't have it available out there where we are . But when we did have it , uh , we , that 's what we usually watched , Uh-huh . was C N N and sometimes we 'd watch the weather stations . Yeah , that 's , uh , same , yeah , 

that 's , when I had it , I , I watched it , you know , religiously for half an hour and then you could go on , you know , to do what else you wanted to do . Yeah . Yeah I find I , I read very little , I do n't even get a regular newspaper and , uh , because , uh , I , I do n't drive that much , I only live about a mile from where I go to school and work , I , uh , I find I spend so little time in the ra- , in the car that I do n't really listen to the radio , you know , I do n't , so . So television is my main new source . Oh , I get that too , because I , I 'm in a van pool , Uh-huh . and I 'm in the van , you know , uh , two hours a day an . Oh really , to commute to work ? Yes , yes . Oh . And in the , in the morning I try to sleep because it 's , it 's dark thirty . But in , but in the afternoon , uh , I try to read so I can , can , uh , not pay attention to what our driver is doing . Yeah , I can , 

the van pools I know that , and I 'm in the Baltimore , Washington area , and I know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas , but if you want a nicer home , you know , beyond the suburbs , you know , I , that 's necessary . Yeah . Yeah . Are , are you in Baltimore itself ? I am , I am right outside Baltimore . I am less than a mile from the Baltimore line . Um . And I go to a br- , a campus of the University of Maryland that is just , less than a mile from my house . So I , I 'm actually in Baltimore , yeah , you could say I 'm in Baltimore . Yeah , I have two kids over there . Oh really , 

in Baltimore ? U- , well no , in , in D C area . Uh-huh . Yeah one works for the State Department and , uh , uh , the other one is , uh , uh , her husband is in the m- , Navy and he 's stationed at Bethesda an . Uh-huh , oh that 's , that 's , that 's a really nice area , Bethesda area . Uh-huh . 

Uh-huh , it 's , um , it 's funny , there 's a big difference between Baltimore and Washington , even though they 're so close . There 's only an hour , less than that between the two but there is a big difference in things like property values and , um , the closer you get to Washingt- , D C the more expensive it is . Uh-huh . And , um , the , the , uh , different slant . Washington , it really is a , uh , uh , an international city , where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore . You know , it , there 's really , uh , most people have relocated to the Washington area , you know . Oh no , I 'd , I 'd rather have Baltimore with the home town atmosphere . Yeah , that 's , I , I like it , I like it a little bit better , too . It 's interesting though , um , to meet different populations . I , I 'm just now being , uh , from Pittsburgh originally , I 'm just now meeting different populations like Chinese students and things and I find that really interesting , you know , to imagine , here is somebody that was in China , le- , two years ago when all that was going on in , in , uh , Beijing . You know , that , that 's an interesting , uh , interesting perspective . But I , I really much , much like the hometown area , yeah . And I think that also goes , it 's funny , you , you can watch different news . I can watch Washington news or Baltimore news and I really do watch Baltimore news . You know , that really makes , I do n't really bother with the Washington station because I just , it 's so far removed from what I 'm interested in . Well most of what they 're talking about in Washington is , is the crime problems that they 're having there . Uh-huh , yeah they , in fact they just , it was just a big thing recently they 've had some terrible problems with Hispanics , um , they had to impose a curfew that , uh , in two of the areas in , uh , in the Washington suburbs . The mayor , 

they 've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then , uh , brought in , 

Uh-huh , I heard about that . Yeah , and then came a woman that 's um , she 's big in the Democratic party so that 's good , so she has good national ties , but she also was , um , something like a , t- , uh , state auditor or something like that before this position . She was a state auditor , I guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia , at Washington . And then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party and now she ran for mayor , so she 's uh , fiscally she 's pretty tight , and , uh , she 's cleaning house an , and it looks like hopefully she 'll do a nice job , uh , for Washington , you know , which is , you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there . You know , from what I pick up on the news , uh , it 's a difficult process , you know , to get rid of a , a bad mayor . Yeah , well I know both of my kids did n't want to live anywhere around the , the downtown areas , Right . they both moved way out . Uh-huh , yeah . I think one of them lives in Germantown and I ca n't remember where the other one lives . Yeah , but those are ni , Germantown is a nice area . Uh-huh , yeah . It 's a nice area . It 's , means they have to drive a little bit , but , 

Yeah , well they might be car pooling too . Do they car pool in ? Are they driven by themselves . Uh , well now , I , I think he carpools , Uh-huh . Because he 's got fairly regular hours since he came back , but , uh , now my daughter ha , they have probably been carpooling together , in fact , because she had been called back up , active duty . Uh-huh , yeah . And then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last Friday . So , I have n't talked to them this weekend , I do n't know what the situation is , but she was , Uh-huh . They did n't call you for Mother 's Day ? 

We were gone . You were n't home ? Uh , d- , no , we were n't home but she had , she had le , called and left a message on our recorder but I had that from all my kids except for one . Yeah , oh , that 's good . So . Well I guess we should stop now . Well I thank you for calling , I have enjoyed it . Uh-huh , oh good . I really do like this program because I get to talk to people from all over the United States , yeah . Uh , uh , so do I , I 've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very politically motivated or whatever , I , I really enjoyed it . It 's , it 's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective . It 's interesting to see the , the wider world , so I enjoy it . Hey , thanks a lot , and , and bye . Thank you , bye , bye .
