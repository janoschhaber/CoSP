Okay . Uh , do you live in a home ? Yes . Uh-huh . We , we , it 's a house we bought , uh , about two and a half years ago now . Oh , did you ? Uh-huh . Uh-huh . First house . We 've lived in ours for about six years . We had it built , actually . Uh-huh . And , uh , uh , it 's our first home , too . Uh-huh . Yeah . So what do you think of , of owning a home as opposed to , to renting somebody else 's ? Um , well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that -- Uh-huh . -- we were living in , and , um , that was quite an experience . I , I much prefer having my own home and , and , uh , just the space and , and more privacy . Uh-huh . Yeah . 

Do you have , is it a fairly large house ? Um , it 's , uh , uh , it 's like twenty-four fifty square feet . Oh , that 's pretty good size . Yeah . It 's a two story . Uh-huh . Yeah . How about yours ? It 's tiny . Is it small ? It 's not much bigger . Actually we had an apartment , two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is . So . 

Oh , really . Yeah , it 's , uh , it 's only like eleven hundred square feet . Oh , uh-huh . Do you , do you have children ? Just one . Just one . Yeah . Oh . But , it , it , uh , all the rooms are small , I mean , but it ends up giving us three bedrooms , which we wanted . And , uh . Use an extra one for an office -- Oh , uh-huh . -- which is handy . Yeah . I 'd rather have , have more rooms and less space in each one I guess . Rather have lots of rooms and lot- , lots of space , but , uh , that ends up costing me . Oh yeah , yeah . Well , like , um , how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood ? . Well , they 're , it 's pretty typical , I mean , it 's a very , very middle class neighborhood . Uh , lots of , lots of young couples with , you know , usu- , oh , I 'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood , that 's their first homes -- Oh , uh-huh . -- and , uh , lots of kids and stuff , and , so it , it fits well , in the neighborhood . It 's , it 's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood , but on the other hand , it 's clean and kind of suburban -- Yeah . -- little bit more than I want . Yeah . Is , is yours also -- Uh . -- pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood -- Yeah , it , it , -- -- or is it ? -- it , it does , it , it seems about , oh , probably average . Um . Uh-huh . But our neighborhood has a , just a wide variety of , of , um , people , and , you know , there 's older people here , and , and , um , people that are our , our age , we 're in our thirties . Uh-huh . And , um , there 's a lot of kids , a lot of kids . MUMBLEx People across the street have eight . 

Uh-huh , wow , eight kids ? Uh-huh . Oh , my gosh . Yeah , their home just burned down -- Ooh . -- matter of fact , and , um , last summer , and they 're just rebuilding and , um , their house is going to be really big . It 's . I 'm sure , with eight , gosh . Yeah , they 're building a lot bigger . He 's , uh , um , uh , oh , not an obstetrician , an , an orthopedic surgeon . Uh-huh . And , um , so since the house did burn , they 're , they 're going , it 's quite different than it was before , and it 's -- Uh-huh . -- it 's a lot bigger . Yeah . 

And , um , but ours is about , it 's , you know , it 's a nice home , it 's definitely not one of the , the smaller ones , and , um , it 's not the biggest either . But . Yeah , new ones , I mean , they , they tend to , to be real tiny , but that uh , especially in newer neighborhoods , my , my brother just built a new house . He lives in Wichita , Kansas , and the , um , the neighborhood actually fought him on it , because he , he was , um , the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood . Oh . Now , that 's because he was , he 's doing a lot of it himself -- Yeah . -- and , you know , for example , landscaping and , and lots of the other stuff , and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots MUMBLEx in the neighborhood , but -- Yeah . You . -- but they were , they were pretty touchy on it . He was a little surprised . You know , that 's interesting you say that , because we do have , we have those architectural codes here -- Uh-huh . 

-- and when we , um , put out house in , um , they wanted us to have , there was one , we have part siding -- Uh-huh . -- on , on the two story part and then -- Uh-huh . -- on the back , and , they , there was one side where our chimney was , and just the chimney was going to be brick , and they wanted us to have more brick , so we ended up having to go halfway up -- Uh-huh . -- which , it does look nicer , and , you know , we would have like to have had all brick , but , of course at that point we could n't afford it , and , but , it 's funny that you 'd say that , because there were homes in here that did n't have any brick at all . Right . So it 's kind of like , they were . Kind of depends on when they get in , you know . 

Yeah , yeah , and , I , and so it was kind of like it 's they , 

ours is the last street that they built on . So the houses actually on our street are a little bit , they 're kind of gone a little bit nicer . Oh , they have , it 's gotten , yeah . Yeah , I mean , just -- Yeah , oh . -- they , you know , it 's like the second phase -- Uh-huh . -- and , and so they 've kind of changed the , the codes a little bit , and so that 's kind of why , I guess , they stuck us with more brick when there were -- Um . -- other homes that did n't have any . Well , see , my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that , because they , they moved into a neighborhood and bought a , a real nice stone house down in South Austin . Oh , uh-huh . And , uh , and , the , what the builder apparently plans to do , is they , they do phase one , and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled , uh , codes and , and , and stuff , and then they come back in , and , and then they sell ,
