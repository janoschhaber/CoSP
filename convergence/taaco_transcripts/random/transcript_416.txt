Well , let me see , what have you seen lately ? 

Well , uh , CITY SLICKERS , and STAR TREK FIVE . FIVE ? Yeah , yeah . Y- , only , only five ? Yeah . I thought I 'd better see that one before I go and see six . Well , no , did n't need to . No , I found that out . How about yourself ? I just saw the latest one . How is it ? It was fantastic . Oh , I ca n't wait . Yeah , it 's , the lines in there were just perfect . I mean , it was classic TREK . Now , does the old STAR TREK guys meet the new guys ? No , huh-uh . No , it 's just the old guys still . Yeah , 

it was just a rumor that that would happen this time . However , the rumor is , is that it will happen next , happen next time so , You know , that I read in PEOPLE or somewhere , no , it was U S A TODAY -- Uh-huh . -- that they said they were n't going to do anymore . That was it . 

Uh-huh . But , Yeah , uh , except that the rumor is , is that they still might , but it may not include the entire crew and it will be a next generation meets this generation . Huh . So , I 'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the , the old guys was . I think it 's a hundred years . Huh . Somewhere in that range . Considering that Spock was on an , uh , you know , couple weeks ago -- Oh , that 's right . -- and that the , the very first episode of NEXT GENERATION , they had McCoy . Is that right ? He was -- And , -- a doctor -- Uh-huh . -- still ? Yeah , well , you know , he was rear admiral , whatever , you know , and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow . Vulcans age a lot better . Well , yeah , he did n't look too bad , did he ? No , huh-uh . Matter of fact , he looks just as about as old and the , uh , NEXT GENERATION as he does in the latest STAR TREK . Imagine that . Yeah , that 's amazing . But , did they have some pretty good special effects ? Oh , excellent , excellent special effects . But I think the script was , you know , just incredible compared to the last one . Yeah , FIVE was , the script was bad , bad , bad . Well , you know why ? No , I do n't . Why ? Uh , William Shatner wrote it . Oh , is that right ? And even worse , he directed it . Uh , L- , Leonard , s- , Nimoy , he does a lot better . Oh , yeah , he , in fact , uh , he did n't direct this one . He produced this one . But he directed the one before , uh , I think STAR TREK FOUR , something like that . IN SEARCH OF SPOCK , or , no , JOURNEY HOME , I think that was . Yeah , uh-huh . Are , you 're a real life Trekkie ? 

L- , I think so . I really like them . I , I would n't go so far as being a Trekkie , but -- Uh-huh . -- uh , Well , I 've gone to , you know , one for real live Trek Convention but , Oh , really ? Yeah , I saw James Doohan , you know , the guy that plays , uh , Scotty . Huh , did you get to talk to him ? No . It was -- Not in a crowd like that . -- crowded . Huh-uh . No . It was like , uh , want an autograph , want to stand in line for about four hours . Yeah . Wow . It was a pretty crowded place . Huh . They have some good management principals in this NEW GENERATION . Oh , yeah , yeah , I , it 's , it 's kind of funny . I , uh , was reading in , uh , a book . Uh , trying to think , I ca n't quite remember the name of the book , but it was , it was saying do n't do STAR TREK management style . And they were referring to , you know , Captain Kirk , every time he left the Enterprise , everything went to hell . Oh . And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship . Right , so he kind of was a cowboy type , too . Uh-huh Made all the decisions but , uh , Jean Luke does more of a , a , committee type of management . Uh-huh , 

yeah , uh , it 's definitely a lot better . A lot more realistic really . 

What other movies have you seen ? Uh , saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week . Oh , how was that ? It was pretty good . Uh , there were a few things different than the old series , but on the , on the whole , it was pretty similar . And , a lot of fun . Lots of little funny spots , huh . Oh , yeah , yeah . Did they have Thing and , Oh , yes , in fact , Thing has a big , much bigger role than he does in the series . I mean , you know , there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day . Really ? And he runs around a lot . How did , I 've always wondered how he gets around . Uh , you know , just finger hopping . But he 's in a box , right ? No , 

no , no , in fact , it 's funny . He never did , does come in out of a box , I do n't think . Yeah , he was just kind of walking around . Did n't he used to ? Not really . He was always -- Oh . -- in the box before . Oh , that 's , yeah , that 's , okay . Yeah . Yeah , that 's what I was thinking .
