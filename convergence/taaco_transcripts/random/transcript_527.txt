Anyway , uh . How about you . What do you do with your budget ? What do I do , uh , at the moment it 's under chaos . Uh , right now I 'm just , uh , I , I do n't really have a budget per se . I 'm , I , uh , it 's called living within your means . Uh-huh . You know , which means at the moment , paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car does n't collapse . Yeah . That 's true . Uh , but , uh , no I do n't really have a budget at the moment . Uh , but I have uh , I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month and then I do n't , usually do n't exceed that unless I , unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another , like if I have car expenses and then that , then it goes through the moon , so . Yeah , that 's sort of a problem . Yeah , so uh , what do yo- , We 're trying , we 're trying to , uh , so far we are in the clear credit wise but , uh , the other side of it is , so , not much on that side of it to add to it . We 're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that but , So you can afford to get a house ? Yeah , we 'd like to do that some day . We have this dream . Yeah . But , we do n't know how long it will be a dream . We , we 're kind of real , we 're real happy that we do n't have any debt , but we 're at the same time we 're real scared about incurring it in this , uh , economy right now so -- Yeah . -- we 're stepping real careful and trying to see what 's the best way to save what , the little bit that we do get , you know , on top of expenses every month . So , what do you and your husband do ? We 're missionaries actually . Are you really ? Yeah , uh-huh . And , uh , it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have , uh , like , uh , uh , support quota -- Um . -- and it 's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here . No kidding . And it does n't get switched very easily once you come home . I see . So , 

Overseas , where would you be going ? Africa , Nigeria . Really . Yeah . Really . How long would you be there ? About four years . We 're career so , we , we go over seas for four years and then we come back for a year . We go over four , we come back for a year . With , with what Church ? Uh , we 're with Wycliff Bible Translators . Oh yes . Yes , -- So . -- I , uh , I know who they are . They , uh , they have an office , uh , in in Costa Mesa as I recall . Yeah , they could very well and , There , there was , uh , you know , there was a fairly large building that that was well that belongs to them . So , uh , are you , uh , are you , uh , active in translation ? Uh , we will be . I was over , over four years doing language surveying which is the first step . You 're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need . Uh-huh . And , uh , came home and got married and we will go ba- , back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family as translators . 

Well , I always wanted to do translation , 

but as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it 's easier . You know they really need surveyors cause you could , you 're free to travel anywhere . You do n't have kids hanging around you and stuff . True , true enough . So , uh , what , what , uh , what languages do you speak besides English , of course ? Well , I have a smattering of about ten different ones , but there 's , 

I 'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other , you know , since I did -- Uh-huh . -- you know , complete a survey in one area , I 'd switch to the other . So I know the greetings in about ten , and how to do market stuff , but in about , uh , about five I guess , I can do better in it . And my French is pretty good but it 's , uh , MUMBLEx French so , uh , I 'm terrified to speak in , uh -- In France . -- in France . Yeah , because they 're real snobby about their language and MUMBLEx French is street French and I just picked it up off the street and I knew what I was , I knew what I was communicating , but I did n't know what I was saying . I never sat there and got a direct translation and said something here when I came home and French to somebody and he paled and said , uh , I 'm not going to tell you what you said . So , since then I have refrained from speaking any French . So . In MUMBLEx . Uh , I do n't know what I said to him but , uh , I did n't ask him either . Must have been terrible . 

The , uh , was it Henry Macon said that the , the , uh , language was like a man slowly bleeding to death . So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die and I , it just amazes me that the French do n't recognize that . Free style English is just , takes on ,
