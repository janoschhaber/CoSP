Not very good it 's not been a good day . I went ,  

I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon . I do n't know . I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn so I hope she 's turned it in . Are you eating ? Uh , I ju- , go ahead , I 'll stop eating . I just barely got -- No it 's , -- home from the university . Say what ? I just barely got home from the university . Tell you what we can do is , uh , I can punch the , uh , one ,  and then w- , after five minutes when the , uh , uh , voice comes on , we can talk all night if we want . Okay , go ahead , fire away . Uh , I love the irony of , uh , talking about this subject on April the ,  fifteenth . But , uh , I 'm afraid I 'm , I 'm probably in the minority . I , I actually do n't think that we , uh , pay too much in this country . Uh -- I agree with you . -- uh , particularly , uh , in this part of the country w- , uh , I guess I do have a , a bone to pick with , uh , uh , the way taxes are distributed . Uh , I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form -- Huh . -- and the sales tax ca n't . I think that 's regressive and , uh , uh , it 's kind of dumb . I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax . But , on the other hand , I do n't mind that it 's only on , you know , things that are n't like groceries and that , it 's not on that . Well , I mean , nobody taxes groceries . Oh , yeah , they do . Where ? In Arizona . Is that right ? Uh-huh .  But we have a pretty low income ta- , I mean pretty low tax rate here . Oh , I think the , the sales tax , they just got to do something about it . Right . But that 's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes . Right . But I guess when I hear , when I see the comparison between the United States and , uh , any other western country , uh , their , their rates are like , uh , forty-one , forty-two and ours are like thirty-six , thirty-seven , you know , if you compute as a percentage of total income , all taxes lumped together , we actually do pretty well . T- , th- , there 's no other country that 's , that is taxed as low as we are . Well and I still think that , having lived in Europe for awhile , you know , difference in living conditions -- Yeah . -- are certainly well worth , uh , what we pay for it . Uh-huh . I 'm , I 'm not sure I understand what you mean . Well , I mean , I think , I was in Germany , you know , for several years -- Right . 

-- and I 'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have , then have to live there . Oh , you mean , lowest end of living in spite of lower , higher taxes . Yeah . Higher taxes . Yeah . I suppose that 's true , yeah . Uh , probably m- , less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever but , Still 's that way to some extent . Yeah . I think the other problem is , you know , it , it 's easy to complain about taxes because there 's something you , theoretically , can do something about . Right . But I look , for example , and you 're not quite in the same situation but like school taxes for me -- Right . -- biggest bargain in the world . I wish I did n't have to pay any more fo- , to my physicians in a year -- Right . -- than I had to pay for all of my school taxes . Yeah . Yeah , since , uh , I send my kids to parochial school , that MUMBLEx . Yeah , that , that 's probably a little tougher on you . It 's not , it 's not quite the bargain that MUMBLEx .  But , I mean , I pay them gladly . That 's a decision , I think it 's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a , uh , two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f- , with the same tax money . But , uh , I mean , that 's , that 's the way Americans want to interpret it , I guess that 's all right . But , yeah . I ,  

and if I were , uh , when I was single and again when I 'm retired ,  I will not mind paying , uh , what it takes to keep the schools good . That 's always been a high priority . No , I think that 's just you though . I do , yeah , that 's true . I think in places ,  I think in places like California , people are beginning to find that in , in areas that are fairly well off , if you add the , uh , uh , people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are , uh , just looking for fun , th- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they ca n't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens . Yeah . And , uh , ,  there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they ca n't get anything done . That seems a , a , like a cultural lapse . I mean , people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools . They , Of course , I think with the graying of America , we 're going to see that problem in lots of places . Right . Yeah . People would rather , uh , increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them . But I think it 's sad -- 

Or build roads . 

-- selfish and shortsighted . Yeah .  Well ,
