Okay , well , um , What kind of music do you like ? I , um , I was thinking about it for a long time , and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music . Um , I do n't have a whole lot of dislikes . I , um , like jazz , um , especially the blues , and , uh , I like , uh , a lot of the , uh , of course the classics , um , everything back from Bach and , and Beethoven and Chopin and , um , just in general everything . Uh-huh . Um , I enjoy , uh , a lot of the , the modern forms , um , uh , Do you like , like rock and those kind of things -- Right , right . -- punk even . Uh , well , that gets , some of the punk , um , when I was in high school , that was , uh , one of the big things , was punk music , and , uh , a lot of it is , has a lot to say , or some of it has a lot to say , the music does , the lyrics do , but the , the actual , I do n't think they have a whole lot to say , even . Uh , well , it , it 's , it 's , it really expresses some of the opinions of , of the people who enjoy the music -- Yeah , I guess . -- um , but as far as a musical art form , I just do n't see a whole lot of art to it . Uh-huh . Um . Do you like rap ? Um , some of it , um , it depends . I like , uh , the rap , the two types of rap I like , or I enjoy to listen to , and one is the , the rap that is just funny , um , and they usually do a lot of satire -- Yeah -- -- um . -- that kind I kind of like . Right . Some of it is kind of -- Right , the monotonous -- -- pointless , yeah . -- the monotonous , no that 's not , I do n't enjoy that at all -- Uh-huh . -- when they 're just talking about , well , I 'm better than you , and blah , blah , blah . I do n't like -- Yeah , yeah . -- that . I like the funny , satire , and then some of it is , some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our , in -- Yeah . -- urban society . It really does . It talks about , um , race relations and police relations 

and , um , that , that -- -- I guess I do n't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny -- Uh-huh . -- more satire kind some times . Um , I 'm , with you though , I like classical -- Uh-huh . -- um , I do n't like to listen to it all the time , but , um , some of the time , anyway . I like easy listening , just kind of , you know , I guess I do n't care much for rock and roll any more . I used to like it all right , but I do n't really care to listen to it any more for some reason . Um , let 's see . Country western , uh , I 'm not quite as big on that . Some of it 's okay , uh -- Yeah , that 's , that 's about my opinion of that . -- yeah . It 's , it 's okay , um , Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess , so . Um . The thing about country western that I do n't enjoy is is , does n't seem to be any imagination behind it -- Yeah . 

-- the , one country and western song sounds like every other , a lot of them , country and western -- sound , uh , really similar , yeah . 

-- and so the , the musicians do n't get to really get into their music . They just play a certain number of chords -- Yeah . 

-- the drummer plays a certain beat , and you have a country and western song -- Um . -- and , Well , that 's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes , too , I guess . They do n't really , has kind of the same sound over and over , and the other thing I do n't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you ca n't understand what the lyrics are -- Um . -- you ca n't understand what they 're saying on some of those songs -- Right . -- which probably is just as well on some of them , too . Yeah . And I ca n't say that I like a lot of the modern , the very , very -- Yeah . -- modern , uh , rock and roll , but I , I definitely , I really enjoy the fifties , the sixties and a lot , some of the seventies -- Yeah -- -- rock and roll -- -- earlier things . -- and , uh , I really enjoy , especially the sixties ...
