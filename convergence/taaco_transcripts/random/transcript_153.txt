Okay , do you have any pets ? Yeah , I have three cats and a dog . Oh , boy . Sound like us , we have , Um , go ahead . Um , we just got the , the dog less than a year ago so , he 's still a puppy . Oh , what kind is it ? He 's a mixed breed , he 's part Collie , part Shepherd , and part Chow . Oh , so you MUMBLEx , More Collie and Shepherd than Chow , the only Chow he 's got is , is his tongue . Oh , he 's got a blue tongue ? Yeah . Oh . He 's got little spots on them . We have two Chows and , , a miniature Schnauzer , and recently added , a guinea pig , , which was n't by my choice , but I was out ruled , so , , but the dogs are mainly mine and my husb- , but I just love them to death . Was the guinea pig for your , Daughter , yes . for your child ? Yes , as if the dogs were n't enough , had to have , a guinea pig , so , anyway she 's , she enjoys her though , so that 's , that 's what matters . But , um , our Chows , we 've had them , I 'd say , right around six maybe seven years and , Really ? they 're , um , registered and we 've been breeding them . She 's had about four or five litters . Oh , my , my husband 's always wanted a Chow but I 'm kind of concerned about , um , with having cats , Oh . 

and how , how they socialize with cats . Um , which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed . Right . Um , because we thought they would socialize easier , Uh-huh . um , my husband had originally wanted an MUMBLEx and his brother has an MUMBLEx and he , so far he 's bitten ten people . Oh , man . So , Goodness . And the people that he got the MUMBLEx from , used to have cats and they no longer have any other cats . So , It 's telling , um , you know when we had , um , we had a cat when we first married , no , took , yeah , we had the cat first , and then we got , uh , the Chow . And , , bring , um , bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her . 

Uh-huh . And , uh , you would think , you know , that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and , and paw at their face and they 'd just play and they were never , they never harmed her . So , uh , they got along great , now I do n't know how , how it would be bringing in , uh , like cat to a full , full grown dog . Yeah , I would n't want to bring a cat into a full grown dog , Yeah . but I , I would n't feel , um , hesitant about bringing a puppy in , Right . to adult cats , I think they would socialize easier . I think , so , too . Um , how , how old is your child ? Five . Five ? 

She 's a real MUMBLEx . So , you had the dogs before you had the baby ? Right . And I was , , not really concerned about , um , them harming her , uh , I think , I think a lot of that , that , that we hear all the time is how you bring them up . Uh-huh . And ours are real friendly , they 're protective , but they 're very friendly , and lovable , Uh-huh . I mean , you think they 're lapdogs . You know , they 'll just come jump on your lap and want to be , have their bellies rubbed and everything and , What color are they ? Uh , the female 's red and the male is black . Oh , I bet the black one 's pretty . Yeah , he is , he 's a big old thing . And , um , I was concerned about the female mainly , and as luck had it , uh , she had puppies the same week my daughter was born , so , it was kind of like , she had her babies and understood about , you know , About your baby . yeah , and that , yeah , I think that really helped and , um , my daughter , you know , since , since she 's little has been playing with them and they let her tug their hair and , and get on their back or whatever and she 's , she 's grown up with them and loves them to death and they love her , so . Yeah , 

I think it 's good for kids to grow up around pets , I do , too . as , as long as they do n't have any allergies to them or anything . Yeah . But I think it really helps them to understand when , when they go to other people 's houses and they have pets , I see so many times kids just , you know , they , mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings . Yeah , exactly , that or , or , uh , the other extreme , they 're , they 're terrified of them and I hate that , Yeah , Yeah . and they should n't be , I mean , some maybe 

but , but , um , like our miniature Schnauzer , she 's just , she 's just like , um , a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly , 

and a lot of kids are scared of that . And which I understand because she is , you know , a lot of movement and everything but when she calms down they 're so scared of her it 's , Huh . it , that bothers me because she 's the friendliest thing , she would n't hi- , you know , harm them at all 

and , and , and that 's mainly people that have never had pets around their children , so , I think , I think it 's a good idea to have them . We 've had , um , in the past , we 've had birds , too , uh , like Cockatoos . Uh-huh . And parrots and , Now , ar , the , the Cockatoos , are those the big ones ? The big white , Yeah . birds with the , the orange crest on top . Yeah . We 've had those , and those are neat , they 're messy , very messy , Are they ? yeah , , and loud . Oh , a lot louder than a dog , you know , a dog you can tell , stop barking , you know , or whatever . Yeah . But the birds , you , it 's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever but , but they were neat , enjoyable animals to have . Well , we 've thought about getting an aquarium , Uh-huh . partly , be- , partly for the cats , I think the cats would really enjoy it , um , Yeah , with a lid , . yeah , yeah , of course , , um , but so far we just MUMBLEx and starting up an aqu- , an aquarium , we , we 're , thinking about getting a saltwater , Oh , yeah they , and they 're so , expensive to start up . Yes , yes , they are , and in your , MUMBLEx the luck of keeping them alive , Yeah . through those first , 

Yeah . you know , few days . The , the saltwater fish have so much more color and they 're so , much more beautiful , 

I know they are . Um , the freshwater tank 's just , really to me they 'll , there 's , most of them really are n't that pretty , no . 

you know , I really do , I really do n't care much for them . Right , I do n't blame you there , I think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than , I do n't know , those fish are just beautiful . Just so , like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something . Yeah , Yeah . Rather than just little fish . But I do n't mind having , Wren my daughter had a , like a little goldfish , Uh-huh . a about a year or two ago 

and it finally died and that was neat , but the- , and they 're , you know , she ca n't play with it , you can just look at it . Yeah , yeah . You know , you ca n't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat and , Yeah , I would n't , I would n't dare have a , a goldfish here because , it would probably be in a small bowl and then my cats would knock it over . Yeah . I have to be real careful about where I put things , Uh-huh . if the cats will , will jump up on things and knock things over all the time , Oh , no . Oh , no . They 're always up where they do n't , where they 're not supposed to be . Yes , yeah , and that 's hard . MUMBLEx that 's just like kids , you know , yo- , they know that they 're not supposed to do it , but they 're going to do it anyway because they know they 're not supposed to . That 's right and they 're so , independent . I love having them for that reason . Yeah , yeah , and until we got the dog , um , it was real easy to , to go to town for three d- , three day weekend or whatever , Sure . and now , Uh-huh . 

it 's like a major production , Uh-huh . trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you 're gone . That 's right , that is hard . And , I , we knew it , but we never even thought that about when we got the dog we just saw him , oh , he 's so , cute , 

Oh . let 's take him home . Yes . You know , and then the first weekend we had him we had , we were in a apartment , in a two bedroom apartment , Uh-huh . and my husband went out of town , and left me with , with the brand new puppy , Oh , fun . and I had to work twelve hours that day , Oh , no . and so , I left the dog locked in the bedroom and I put paper all over the floor . Well , when I came home , I opened the door and there were chunks of carpet , Oh . padding everything , Oh , no . all over the place and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door , Oh , no . I guess you did n't get your deposit back , did you ? Well , I had the carpet fixed , Oh , good . um , I , yeah , I did n't even tell the apartment manager , Oh , okay . who got it . Oh , no . Bless your heart . But that , that was my first real experience with , with a puppy when , when we had our family dog growing up I was eleven or twelve , I think , when we first got him , Uh-huh . and I was n't really involved in the , the paper training , Sure . Yeah . and , you know , teaching him commands and stuff so , this was , and to me , a whole new experience . Yes it is . Only it was n't like cats at all . No , no . I wish it was . I wish they were in that instinct . But they do n't . So , Our only problem with our Schnauzer , she 's an indoor dog , Uh-huh . most of the time , and , uh , we found , she 's right at a year and we finally got her , you know , house trained and everything , uh , her only problem is trash . If you do not pick the trash up , you know , the container , Uh-huh . and put it on a table or chair or something , she 'll knock it over , I do n't care how fu , full she is , so , it 's not like she 's hungry , it 's just she wants to get into trouble . My cats do that it . If I through anything away that 's any kind of meat or anything , Uh-huh . like that , anything that , that they think is good , they 'll get into the trash , Yeah . and then it does n't matter where you put it and where you hide it , Yeah . and how , how tight you have the lid down on it , they 'll get into it . I 've come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor . Oh , I hate that . And the cat 's just looking at me like , sorry . Yeah , you should n't have left it there . I could n't help myself . I just hate that when she does that , I just , oh , and she knows it 's wrong , you 'll walk in the door and she 'll cower and go hide under the table . Uh-huh . So , you , she knows she does wrong . But she , uh , she continues to do it , so . Yeah , the problem that we 're having with our puppy right now he 's not MUMBLEx he 's actually not really a puppy anymore 

he 's like sixteen months old , Uh-huh . um , but he 's still chewing . Oh , is he ? Um , the last thing he chewed up was , uh , when we ...
