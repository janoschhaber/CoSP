Ready to talk ? I guess so . Okay . Okay . Uh , I want to talk about , um , our family budget , Okay . and the times that it 's worked and the times that it has n't worked and , Yeah . give you a general description of it bit . Tell me how yours works . Well , at the my- , 

I introduced you a little bit to it , a few minutes ago , when I said that we are , uh , we 're on the east coast now . Uh-huh . My husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that , well , we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina . Uh-huh . And so naturally we put ourselves , we looked at our budget , Yeah . 

and so , what we did was draw up a budget that we thought , uh , was realistic . Uh-huh . And , uh , so , we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that 's satisfactory , and we 've been here seven months and he 's still has n't hit up on anything permanently . Oh , no . So , you see , That throws the budget out of whack real fast . Well , we actually planned for about one year . Oh , good . Uh , that God because , Really . it never occurred to , That was smart . it never occurred to us that it would take seven months . Yeah . And , uh , what we did was just , uh , decide wh- , how we had been spending our money before , Uh-huh . and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and , uh , and adjusted , Oh , uh-huh . 

where we could come down and where we did n't want to come down , Yeah . and we really , uh , lessened it , uh , our living expenses , uh , more than what we thought we would . Wow , that 's great . But , Did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of , Oh , just our own design . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Gosh . And the , so , but we 've had budgets that did n't work when our , uh , you know , of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked . Yeah We spent too much money , until our children went to college , so . Yeah . So , tell me about , do you all , uh , have a budget ? Well , we 've been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids , of course , and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot , more fun kinds of of things and , uh , did really , um , you know , have a real strict budg- , but , budget but , uh , the about and to our , wh , wh , wh , wh , when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just , you know , dirt poor . Then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we 'd bank my salary so we could buy a house . So , we virtually did that for about two years , Wonderful . which worked real well , and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved , Yes . and moved to Texas , bought a house immediately , you know , which , of course , is now devalued with the housing market , so , I do n't know if we , we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least we 've got a place to live . Um , so , now , since , uh , we have a three year old and a two year old now , um , Three and a two year old . Uh-huh . 

Bang , bang . That 's , that 's , that threw our budget really out of whack too . An we , um , have been just forced to budget much more because I quit working to be home with the kids . And , um , we just really have , uh , I do n't know , we , we 've tried different times , we 've done like a survey of like taking , you know , the past three months of where all the money went . Uh-huh . And we really do n't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all , but it seems like there 's , um , times when we just have to get out where we 'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we 'll go and we 'll blow , you know , fifty , sixty dollars in one night going out to eat , going to a show or doing something , you know . Well , I think that 's important for your budget to be realis , for it to work though , you have to do something . Yeah , that 's the hard part because when we sit down to make it , we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week and then it 's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for , you know , birthday for somebody or , you know , even we , we even do things real frugally for the kids , we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they do n't know the difference at this age , you know , whether they 're JORDACHE new or whether they 're , Of course not . you know , something and they 're both boys so they just MUMBLEx one year after the other in each other 's clothes , so . But , um , that 's the hardest part for us is that it 's really , um , you know , budgeting and some extra things , you know , for- , that are more , you know , nonessential items . Well , I found , uh , that , in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned , Uh-huh . but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents . Uh , we , we tended to want to keep on giving lavish , Yeah . gifts as , Yeah . we had done before . Uh-huh . And I really believe that if you 're going to cut down on yourself , you need to cut down somewhat on your friends . On your friends , that 's true , that 's true . Well , we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with , we both have older cars and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars , you know , on the car in two months or something , Yes . and , you know , a lot of things like that that really ar , are hard to plan for . And , uh , Well , I really do , I think you have to budget those things though . Yeah , kind of put in a certain amount per year , Yes . you 're going to have on extra expenses for car . Exactly , 

although so much per month anyway . Yeah , yeah . And , uh , that really should be in your bu- , but if you do n't spend it , it should be in your bank account at the end of the month . 

Yeah our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions , um , you know , is to , let 's see , now , I forget which way we do it . We do n't list all the deductions and then we get more money back , you know , at the end of the year , Oh , no , no , no , no . so , that 's not a good way to , You do n't want the government to spend your money . You want to be able , that 's what my husband said , so this last year he changed it , of course , we did n't get hardly and then nearly as much back and it was like oh , no . Better find another way of saving money . Well , uh , but I do realize that , that is realistic for some people , Yeah . and it was for us many years , Yeah . for many years . Yeah . Uh , and if , and if that 's the only way that will , it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the , the year then doggone it that 's what you should do . 

Yeah , because we do n't miss it , we really do n't , when it 's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff , so . Uh-huh , uh-huh . But we 're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can en , envision the , uh , expenses for college already , you know , eighteen years away or whatever . Well , I was just reading an article in , uh , a North Carolina pap- , paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at , uh , letters of applications to universities . Gosh . She was o- , she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty , so , it can be done . I guess , Where there 's a will , that 's fantastic . where there 's a will , there 's a way , right ? . 

Yeah . Well , I have enjoyed talking to you . Well , I enjoyed talking to you too , good luck and do n't spend any money this weekend . Oh , I know we 'll have to stay home and mow the yard . Oh , boy . Bye-bye . Bye .
