Well , Steve , did you go to college ? Yeah . In fact , I 'm still going . Oh , that 's good . So you probably could give some great advice . Uh , well , I do n't know about that , but I , in fact , I 'm in the process of trying to choose a P H D school . Uh-huh . Well , what 's your ca- , what 's your interest , your , uh , Uh , well , computer science and cognitive science . Uh-huh . So , That , that 's similar to what , I 'm in a P H D program right now . Oh , I see . And , uh , my area of expertise , it 's information systems , which is a little bit less technical , I think , than , uh , than computer science . But my area of expertise is , uh , uh , human computer interaction . Oh , yeah . And I think that 's one reason why I 'm part of this study , uh , because it 's of , I 'm working with voice systems . Yeah . Yeah . So , so , good luck . I guess we should talk about giving advice , though . Wh , what , what type of advice do you think you 'd give to a , a parent ? To a parent ? Yeah . Well , you know , the thing is , when you 're a kid -- Uh-huh . -- and the kid at that age , especially if they 're going into undergraduate , it seems like they think they know what they want . Yeah . An , and , I mean , choosing from my experience , you know , I thought , you know , my , I know what I want a lot more than my parents know what I want . Uh-huh . But , uh , I do n't know , at the same time , you have to decide what is important about the school , you know , the size of it or , Yeah . I think that 's more important probably than even the career vocation , because most people change . Yeah . I kn , I know very few people that , uh , started in one field and stayed with it . You know , they , I think that 's what you just said , you know , having to do more with the size of the school , the environment of the school , uh , I think that 's much more important . I , I think I 'd , I 'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school , though , that has a number of different types of programs , you know , that , uh , some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer , but some of the , uh , the small , some of the larger small schools , you know , I guess around three or four thousand students -- Yeah . -- have a , can offer a broader range of curriculums and things , so if the kid does change , they do n't have to transfer , or they do n't have to , uh , uh , I do n't know , they do n't have to give up years of , you know , of credit transfer and things . Yeah . That 's disruptive . Yeah . I normally , 

and , and parents hate to hear this , you know , because I , I actually teach college , I hate to , uh , I hate to talk to the parents because , um one of the reasons is because , you know , the kid does n't know exactly what they want , and I always say make sure you major , in something that you like , even if it 's not going to be your career vocation , because you 'll get better grades . I , I think most employers would probably rather hire , you know , a , a three six in , um , in history , uh , to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration . Oh , yeah . Does that make sense ? Yeah . Well , yeah , I see what you 're saying . Yeah . I always , you know , tell them that you should major in something you , you 're going to get good grades in . Yeah . Because that , that 's always , I think , more important , you know , overall . I do n't know . Uh , give me five minutes . Yeah . Oh , you , you 're at the office now ? Yeah . At work ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'm just getting ready to go to lunch . Uh , yeah , that 's like what we were saying , though , would you , uh , advise a private school , or a public school , I would , I would , you know , what 's the trade off there , what , it would , I , I tell you , I live in Maryland , and the public schools here are , pretty good . I teach at a public school , actually , and I know that the S A T scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public sch- , a lot of the private schools . And , um , I actually , I would full time at a , at a public school , and then right now I 'm teaching part time at a private school , at a Catholic institution . Oh , I see . And , um , and I really think , I think I 'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school , because I think their parents pay more , and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged , because their parents are probably college educated , where at the public school , I do n't think as many parents are public , are , are college educated , and I do n't , I think because it costs less , the kid does n't take it quite as serious , you know , they 're not , th- , 

it , it 's the minimal cost . But I think you can get a good education at public or private but I think you can also get a bad education at public or private , you know , I -- Yeah . -- you have to really , you have to look around at the school . 

I , I think the bad part is that most parents or kids do n't know what to look for . Yeah , yeah . I think , uh , I would agree with that . In fact , the thing that , I 'm going through the same thing , where in graduate school , Uh-huh . I was trying to choose . You know , a particular institution might be better -- Right . -- for my area -- Uh-huh . -- yet , like , say , you know , the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something , Uh-huh . might have some top specialists in my area . Right . Yet , if I go to U of I or C M U or , you know , some , you know , any big name school , my quality of education might not be that much better , but it 's the same thing , 

there 's , you know , what will the name recognition , Right . get me , 

Yeah , kind of thing . does it have a big ten football team or , Yeah , 

yeah . That 's that 's usually the basic criteria . Yeah . I mean , uh , yeah , is it a PAC ten school , you know . Yeah . But I think , yeah , see , I 'm , I 'm at the University of Maryland , so in this , this region , um , though I go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland , my diploma will still say University of Maryland . Oh . Um , you know , it does n't , does n't differentiate on my diploma , though I would put it on my resume , what program I went to . But I , I think , you know , I 'm actually at a smaller program , I 'm not at the col- , the big College Park campus , you know , that 's the big one with the football team . Yeah . So I , I think , um , I think you 're right , that there 's a lot of , there 's difficult decisions there based on name recognition . Um , you know , when I first was applying for graduate schools , I applied to some big programs , you know , in this area , like Stevens Institute of Technology , which is recognized in the Northeast as , as , you know , one step below M I T in a sense , Yeah . you know , so it 's got big name recognition in this area , a big science school , no football team , but a big science school , Yeah . and technical people know that . But I don , yeah , I think you 're right , you really have to think about that for the job . I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor 's , and when I , now , I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs , I was going to be a teacher , I was just a high school teacher , so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of , Yeah . 

you know , but then when I went , um , for graduate work , you know , or for a new job , people said to me , you know , Shippensburg State , where is that , you know . Yeah , yeah . And , you know , when I went into higher education , even at other universities , they were n't aware of it , you know . Yeah . So I think yeah , that 's important , um , . I think it depends on if you want to be a , if you want a regional job or a national job , you need that first , Yeah . job or so out of school , too . Yeah . I , I guess another thing that concerns me is , uh , so many people , it seems like everybody today is still in that MUMBLEx job market and , uh , um , where was I at ? Oh , go , in going to school , you get taught the things you learn in school , but there is also a whole other dimension , I mean the growing up while you 're going to school part . Uh-huh , yeah . And , uh , actually , in the Midwest especially , a lot of the schools have , like University of Missouri , will have a main campus like Columbia , which is big , multi disciplinary , Right . 

and they 'll have a satellite campus in a , usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field . So you 've really , uh , I guess sacrificed -- Uh-huh . -- some social -- Right . -- exposure to different groups and everything . Yeah , depending on your technical areas . Yeah , Yeah . I could see that . But , you know , at some of the large schools , I know that at , at , at University of Maryland where I am , you know , in a P H D program , I , I have n't even met , uh , someone outside of my area of information systems except for ,
