MUMBLEx Are you there ? Uh-huh . Okay , 

now tell me your favorite team . Uh , baseball ? Yes . Well , I 've been kind of , been intrigued with the Rangers , uh , more so with , uh , uh , their management than anything else . I , I do n't follow baseball that , that closely , but , uh , you know , since I live here so close to Arlington , uh , that 's the team that I 've been kind of following . Okay . I think it 's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us where do you think they 're headed , so we 'll have to talk about the future -- Uh-huh . -- with the Rangers . Right . What are your thinkings on what they can do , what they 'll be able to do ? Well , I think that , uh , you know , with , uh , so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money , it 's , um , you know , I think I 'm not real sure about th- , do you know anything about Ruben Sierra 's , uh , Well , I heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down . Yeah that , on his , he was willing to come down a little bit and , Yes . And the Rangers go up a little bit , uh-huh . 

but a little bit from three , you know , from thirty million dollars or thirty-five mil- , that 's a lot of money . I think the entire baseball , yeah , they 're the ones that probably are paying the highest . Yeah , they are . And I think this is absolutely ridiculous . Uh-huh . No . And I really think , I really think that , uh , that they ought to , I 'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money . I think they should , uh , uh , pay him what his salary is going to be , uh , and let him , because he 's got one more year before he turns into a free agent . That 's right . And then , uh , who knows , if he produces next year , they may have to end up paying him anyway , but if he does n't , then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for , for a lot less than , MUMBLEx . than they would , uh , if they paid him the si- , you know , the six million dollars a year this year . What I saw on the news today , that Bu- , Buechele was back just to visit . Uh-huh . I 'm awful sorry he 's not still . Oh , yeah , but you know , what , he , that was a great deal for him . Oh , I 'm sure it was . Yeah , it was a great deal for him and , and , uh , he just signed on , uh , I think it was like a five year deal with , uh -- Pittsburgh . -- Pittsburgh . 

Yeah . So , you know , he 's real happy there . As far as the Rangers are concerned , I think , I think they need some , definitely need some pitching . Yes , sir . Uh , and so I , you know I , Well , what do you think of Howse , who is the coach for the pitchers ? The pitching coach ? Yes . Well , you know , I was just looking at the news tonight , and they showed a , a , a black guy that was go , was helping out , uh , His assistant . His assistant . Uh-huh . 

And I think that 's a , a great addition . I mean , he seemed to know what he was doing and , and , uh , I really wish they could see fit to get rid of Howse . Oh , you do n't like Howse , huh ? No , no , I really do n't . And I 'm not going to stand up , you know on my , soapbox and say that , but I 'm , not fond of Howse and I 'm not fond of Grieves . Oh , Tom Grieve ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'm , I 'm not sure that , um , that they 're ready to get rid of , of , uh , Tom Grieve yet , but Howse might be a different , uh , situation , and I think you 're probably right , that they , that they need some , you know , some changes in , uh , pitching coach , maybe and , um , Well , I 'm just gullible enough that I think Bobby Valentine is , um , uh , doing all right and I 'm sure , You do , huh ? Well , That 's contrary to , uh , popular belief , you know . Oh , I know , I know so , but I would like so much for these Rangers to get their act together and give , um , oh , uh , Nolan Ryan the support he needs . Oh , I know . You know , it 's too bad that , uh , it has to be a forty-two year old guy to , to lead the , uh , the Rangers , you know . I understand . They need to have some , some young guys that can take the lead and , and , uh , Well , I just oh , I have so many mixed emotions about all this . Yeah . But I think with their new stadium , they should go and let ,
