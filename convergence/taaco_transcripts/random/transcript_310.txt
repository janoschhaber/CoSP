I really have n't seen any movies lately , so when the computer picked this one , I was a little bit surprised , but , I think I have n't been to the movie theater here in about , oh , six months , but , uh , you know , the last movies that I 've seen were probably on video . Oh , well that 's , 

we rent a lot of videos -- Yeah . -- too . Uh , we saw , I have two little babies and we saw one movie recently and that was THE TERMINATOR -- Uh-huh . 

-- movie , uh , which I did n't like after all . Yeah , now I ha , I have n't seen THE TERMINATOR movie , but , and that 's kind of blood and guts , is n't it . I do n't particularly care for that sort of stuff . Well , I do n't either . It , on all the , the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he does n't kill anybody in the movie . He does n't . He maims them . Yeah , right . So , Yeah , he maims them pretty good , does n't he ? Uh-huh . He , he , uh , I think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part . Yeah . In the movie . Uh-huh . So . I , I saw , uh , SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY . Uh , Oh , I have n't seen that one yet . Uh , I saw it , uh , oh , couple weeks ago I rented it and , uh , watched it and I was , I was pretty disappointed in it because I , I was told by several people that it 's pretty scary and intense -- Uh-huh . -- and I was pretty disappointed in it . Oh . Now it 's a good movie , but , I guess that they built me up too much . Yeah , well , For my expectations in it there . With all the commercials -- Uh-huh . 

-- and everything . I have n't , that 's one we want to see . I , I want to see , uh , DANCES WITH WOLVES . Uh-huh . But , we have n't seen that one yet , either . Yeah . Now I have n't seen it either , but , uh , I 've heard that it 's real long . That it 's a good movie , but it 's long , like three hours . Yeah , th- , that 's what I heard , too . Yeah , we 've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late -- That 's right . -- to watch it . That 's right . We saw , uh , the , the , uh , movie with , uh , Sylvester Stallone , OSCAR . OSCAR . Supposed to be his , uh , his debut in comedy . Uh-huh . Which was an interesting movie , but not very funny . Yeah . 

I know my daughter saw that and she liked it so , Did she ? Yeah . Well , it was , it was an amusing movie . Uh-huh . It j- , , I guess maybe it would have been better if we 'd have been at the theater -- Uh-huh . -- as opposed to , uh , just at the house watching it with , with no one else around . Uh-huh . So , And , of course , I get to watch all these movies like LOOK WHO 'S TALKING and WHO 'S , LOOK WHO 'S TALKING , TOO and , because I have a ten year old so , Oh . We , we watch a lot of movies around that category , you know -- Uh-huh . -- that she , that she can watch . My son just turned two and so THE LITTLE MERMAID is now our favorite movie . Yeah . We seen THE LITTLE MERMAID , too . LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN -- 

Uh-huh . -- I think are , are his two favorites that we 've got . Uh-huh . And there 's some , I think there 's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video , uh , SHIPWRECKED . Oh , I have n't , I did n't hear that was coming out . Uh-huh . Yeah , it 's fixing to come out on video and , boy , I ca n't think of the other one that 's fixing to come out . Well , they just had -- But , -- uh , THE RESCUERS movie -- Uh-huh . -- that was a Disney movie , was n't it . I think I heard that was just one , was just out . He 's , uh , he does n't sit still for the whole movie , yet , but -- Right . -- he likes to , uh , to listen to the music and stuff if there 's a lot of that in the m- , in the movie . Uh-huh . Well , I 'm glad to know that there 's somebody else out there that does n't get to go to the movie theater . Well , I w- , tell you , ever s- , my , my kids are just small babies and , I tell you , we really want to go -- Yeah . -- a lot and , uh , there 's so much out on video now , that it 's almost , you know , the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it . Uh-huh . Sometimes . So . And then they go to the dollar movies . Uh-huh . That seems to happen . I noticed that DANCES WITH WOLVES was playing at the , uh , Granada Theater . Uh-huh . And , uh , someone said that was a lot of fun to go do . You can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie . I thought that might be kind of fun to do . Yeah , that does sound fun . And , of course , you need a baby-sitter for that . Definitely . But , uh , no , I 'd really like to get out to the movies more often . Course , it 's so expensive , now , too -- Right . -- that you ca n't hardly afford it . 

I , I know we get discount tickets -- Uh-huh . 

-- where my husband works , but , other than that it just seems like it 's so expensive . And then the popcorn and everything else , you almost ca n't afford to do it . That 's right . No matter what . Although we did actually get , we went on vacation couple months ago , and we got to go see WHAT ABOUT BOB ? Uh-huh . That was kind of a funny movie with , uh , Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray . Uh-huh . That was fun . Golly , I do n't think that I 've ever heard of that movie . Oh , he 's a , Richard Dreyfuss is a , uh , psychiatrist and Bob is his patient 

and Bob follows him on vacation . It 's , uh , Oh , that 's the , that 's the one where they burn down the house or something -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- the house explodes ? Uh-huh . Oh , okay . Yeah , that 's the one . Okay , yeah . Another movie that I want to see if it ever comes out on video so I can see it without my daughter around is , uh , oh , I just forgot the title of it . Uh . Oh , it 's supposed to be a real scary one . Uh , darn , well , here , here 's another one that I 've seen . I saw , uh , I ca n't remember the title of it , either . Must have left an impression .
