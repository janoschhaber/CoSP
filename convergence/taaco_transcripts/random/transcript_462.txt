Okay , now then you heard the question , what -- Uh-huh . -- what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs ? Well , I 'll tell you , I used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on , than I do now . Okay . I do , uh , I do the easy stuff now . I change oil , uh , and then what some people would consider a little more difficult , I , I 'll change spark plugs and -- 

Um . -- I 'll change , you know , points and , you , you know , do air filters , that kind of stuff . Well . But , uh , I ca n't do as much as I used to , um , I used to do a whole lot more , but not any more , they 're just too weird to work on now . Is that the reason you 're not doing it , or are you so busy you do n't have time to do it ? Well , that 's part of it -- Uh . -- yeah , part of it is , like you said , I do n't have time . Okay . Well being a female and being alone , you , I do n't do anything but put gasoline , in my car , and let someone else check the oil even . Uh-huh . But , uh , have you had any major repairs recently ? Well , um , on this car I 've got now , no , but I had a van before , and it was only two years old , and it had transmission go out on it . Oh . But fortunately that was covered under the warranty . Okay . Well , you should be , feel very fortunate . I had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile -- Um . -- and I 'll declare , that 's an expensive . Oh , yeah . Yes , uh-huh . Maybe I should have just traded the car in . Yeah , sometimes it makes you wonder . Oh , it just , well , I have a very comfortable car -- Uh-huh . -- and I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car . 

Uh-huh . So , um , anyway , I have a new transmission , and I 'm sure that any of them would have cost al- , or charged me almost the same amount . But -- Yeah . -- it hurts , it hurts real bad . Did you take it to a dealership ? No , I took it to an independent -- Uh-huh . -- out in Garland . Oh , I see . I had , um , these people were recommended by a neighbor -- Uh-huh . -- and , you know , that 's the only thing , I am not a native of Dallas . Oh , I see . So that means I have to depend on , on trustworthy friends -- Right . -- and that 's . Anyway , it 's fixed , it 's running , and I pray that I get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it . Oh , gosh . Uh-huh . It 's going to run for a li- , for a while yet . Oh , I know it . It certainly is frightening . 

What work are you in ? Uh , I , I work for T I . Oh . I , I work in the networking area . Okay , okay . Do you work for T I ? No . No , okay . No , I have just retired from , um , the Southwest Medical Center . Oh . Yeah , where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car , but they 're all too busy . So . Yeah . 

I have to do it the other way , and that 's find someone and pay them to do it . Yeah , yeah . So I certainly hope you have a nice New Year . Oh , yeah , I 'm , I 'm planning on it . Oh , it ca n't be any worse than last year , that 's for sure . Oh , it could be , but I do n't much think so . Yeah . That 's true , that 's true . 

I 'm , well , we 're starting out a new one , so let 's make it a good one . Yeah , I 'm going to try and plan on it . Okay . All right , well , I enjoyed the conversation . Thank you . All right , thank you . Bye . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
