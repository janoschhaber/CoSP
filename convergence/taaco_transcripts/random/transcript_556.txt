Go ahead . Oh , okay . Yeah , the , uh , subject is child care and how to determine child care , and that 's , uh , an interesting one for me to talk about since I have no children , but I did run a child care facility for a while . Um . And , uh , have some , Well , you should , you should have some opinions on that , then . I do have some thoughts on that , yeah . Uh , it 's , uh , an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for , or parent for a lot of people there , and , uh , it 's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities . Well , I guess if I were going to choose , I mean , my first consideration would be safety . Right . My second consideration would be , uh , uh , health . Right . And , uh , I guess my third consideration would be , uh , warm , environment , warm personal environment . Well , right . Uh , in Texas , we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate on a , at an institutional level and at a , like a small home level so you meet the standards , 

but then after that there 's , there 's a lot more . I think it 's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff , is qualification of people who work there , and in hiring people who would work at the , uh , day care , the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people , uh , in terms of , not just , just because somebody has a child or , uh , likes children does n't really mean that they 're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that -- Oh , absolutely . -- that , uh , As a matter of fact , I believe that the safety and , and health , uh , issues , uh , depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children . Exactly . And that was the most difficult thing of all , to find the , the right people , the qualified people . And it 's the most difficult of all for a parent , judge , uh -- Oh , -- because a person can be very nice and warm and loving , but if he 's a space cadet and does n't watch the children , and be aware of what the safety hazards are , Oh , exactly . And the other thing that 's difficult in , uh , it 's a too small setting , like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child , because you do n't want to just warehouse the child , and I did n't want to run an institution where that was the case , where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four , five years or so important and you have to have the right kind of enrichment and that , that includes , uh , an atmosphere in which the child is safe and , and he 's watched and his physical needs are cared for , but also his , uh , developmental needs are cared for , too . Maybe the right thing to do is to , uh , when a couple has a child , then they should both take , you say the first four or five years are the most important , and I think I would agree with that , they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting . That would be lovely . Get rid of all these child care centers , at least for young kids below the age of six . 

Uh-huh . And then , uh , and then , of course , to make up for that , uh , the , uh , parents would have to work in their later years longer , you know , in other words , they probably would not work , may not , en , may end up not working at all d- , in the twenties . Uh , Well , that 's an interesting thought because , But then they have to work from age thirty or , or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety . That would be okay . That would , that would help on the other end , too , in , in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be . Right , well , you know , the , uh , uh , the world is changing f- , uh , from instit- , from , uh , industrial , uh , base to , uh , information base and so -- Uh-huh . -- what that means is you do n't have to be physically powerful to work . That 's exactly right . All you have to do is have a sharp mind , and I believe that , uh , mental acuity is easy to sustain , maintain , if you just simply continue to exercise your mind . Oh . So I think a person could work , uh , into the seventies , eighties , even nineties for that matter , if they did n't have to do a lot of physical , uh , labor , they could main , maintain , uh ,
