Okay , you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team , or who you think will be doing well this year . Uh , well , where I 'm from the Atlantic coast conference is a very big conference and , course , we have Duke University that was the national champions last year , so I 'm kind of hoping that they 'll repeat again this year . They have a lot of the same players back . Are we talking about , is this the N B A ? No , this is college -- This is college , -- basketball . College , okay . Right . 

We have like Carolina , and Duke , and Georgia Tech , and N C State , teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty . Uh-huh . So , hopefully we 'll have a good year . I do n't really follow the N B A very closely . And see that 's probably all , all I saw . I , we have moved in the last couple years from Utah to Texas and there 's so many colleges and universities in Texas , we have n't really followed them too much and none of them are our , our alma mater so , that seems to help . Do you like professional basketball ? Uh , I , I follow it especially around the playoffs , so , course , I was real familiar with the Utah Jazz , and the Mailman or Karl Malone was , you know , pretty big thing and , the Lakers have always been amazing to watch . Yeah . I , I did keep track a little bit of the Mavericks . They 've not had any good seasons for a long time , and have a lot of problems with , with Tarpley and , maybe now that that 's over they 'll , they 'll come out of it but , Well , that 's an up and coming team , though . Yeah , I hope they do something . They need to or they 're not going to have any of the team left at all . 

That 's somebody you can get behind and , be patient . Yeah . Kind of like the Cowboys , I guess . Yeah , they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons . Yeah , they , coming out of it this year . We 'll see if it 's held on . 

But , I think Chicago will probably with the N B A again . The Bulls ? Yeah , uh-huh . Yeah . They 'll probably be pretty good . Course , the Celtics are always really , really good , too , with their players . That 's true . Be interesting to see how the Olympics does this year with all the , the N B A players playing on the Olympic team . That 's true , it will be interesting . So , It will certainly be different . Yeah . I do n't know , how close I 'll follow them , though . And the season has n't started yet . I 'm usually more the end of the season person , and we need to talk about baseball and so , Yeah , oh , my Atlanta Braves . Well , Well , I really do , uh , you know , the basketball season 's supposed to start in the next couple of weeks . It 's , yeah , yeah . It 's a long season . 

It is , it is , and that 's why I 've , I guess my mind went blank . It 's like last season was so long ago and I have n't really even started thinking about basketball yet so , Yeah . But , this was n't a good subject , but , It 's a little early . We 'll see how our predictions come true . We definitely will . Okay , it 's good talking to you . Good to talk to you . All righty , bye . Bye-bye .
