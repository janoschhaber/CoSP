Kathy ? Uh-huh . Do you , So , what is your , uh , family , what do you usually do as far as budgeting ? We have a very detailed budget . Because my husband is a finance major . Uh-huh . And we have , you know , we have money that we take out each month that we , uh , you know , for food and , and for , for gas and things like that . And then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for , uh , other things . Uh-huh . Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year and we budget them into what we call our , our needs and wants list . Uh-huh . And so , uh , the things that , like a vacation . We have a vacation fund . We have a fund for the things we need . And then a , for the things that we want . Uh-huh . And , uh , and we 're continually putting into those , you know , each month how much we 're going to need and then we know the month that we 're going to have enough to get that particular item . Uh-huh . So we very rarely buy anything on credit . Everything we buy is paid for . Yeah . My husband is a finance major also . And , uh , we kind of have the same plan . Uh , we have one credit card and every month we put , uh , you know , the same amount in for retirement . Uh , and we budget , we 're , our , our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby . So we 're , budgeting , uh , each month , uh , an allowance for his education -- Right . -- starting now . Right . So that 's in our budget every month now . That 's the newest addition . But we too do the same thing as far as , uh , we have a set amount we take , oh , one big vacation a year and then maybe , you know , three small vacations . So we , you know , an , exact amount that we spend on that each year . Right . And , Uh , we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money . Uh -- Uh-huh . -- instead of just writing checks for things . Uh-huh . If we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here . I see . And we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays , that we want to put in for , uh , the vacation . That we put in for Christmas . Like you have a separate account for that then ? Well , a lot of that , uh , I do n't know how safe it is . I guess , uh , we keep it all in a safe here at the house . Oh , I see . Uh-huh . And so it 's actually pulled out . 

Then we keep our -- Oh , I see . -- we have a savings account for the kids ' education . 

That money goes into there . Uh-huh . Each of our , we have three children . So they each have their own account . I see . That money is put into each month . Uh-huh . Does your husband deal in , uh , stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff ? Th- , does he invest in that and -- He does somewhat . -- for long-term ? Yeah . He does somewhat . Uh-huh . Uh , we have an investment plan . Yeah . I guess he does . Uh-huh . But , uh , we have really found , this is the first year we 've done it this way . And we are really saving a lot of money . Really . Because you 're , you 've , you 've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let 's see what are we going to , so what goes into that , that particular thing ? It 's vacations , Christmas . Christmas , birthdays , uh , car maintenance , dental , medical , we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much -- Uh-huh . -- we used on dental and , uh , and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance does n't cover -- Right . -- rather than wondering where it 's going to come from , 

we have it , you know . Uh-huh . And when , when we see something on sale , uh , instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we 've got enough and getting it , and then when something comes up , you know , kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill . Uh-huh . Everything 's taken care of . And we 're finding that we even have more money than we thought . Really . Yeah . Well , you know , uh , what do you do as far as , I , I take it , do you , uh , run the family budget as far as , uh , groceries and that sort of thing ? I do . Uh-huh . All the money . Uh-huh . And how , what 's that ? All the money is turned over to me . Uh-huh . 

Do you have a set amount that , that you spend each month or -- Yes . -- or how do you work that ? I have a set amount . It 's very generous and I usually have extra . Uh-huh . And so then that can go , uh , you know , either back into our checking account or I can just carry it over . Uh-huh . Uh , you know , there are certain months of the year that you 'll spend more on food than other months . And -- 

Uh-huh . -- certain times when that will be left over . But that 's completely up to me how I do that . And -- Uh-huh . -- then , uh , because I do n't work . I stay home . I do too . I stay home also . And so it 's kind of my money and I also get my own money to do what I want to . Go to lunches , you know , and do that kind of thing . Uh-huh . We have a clothing , uh , envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing . Uh-huh . It really works out great . We 're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that . 

And we 're , Yeah . What , what , as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a T V or a big item , like for the house . How , do you have like a household ? Yes . We have a household budget . Like we 're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that 's coming out of her crib this year . Uh-huh . And also , we need a new bed . And so we 've got both of those budgeted and we put a certain amount in each month and we know which month we 'll enough saved to go buy those . Uh-huh . And if we find one on sale before then , then we can just take that and put it towards ,
