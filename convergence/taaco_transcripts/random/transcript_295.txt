Okay . Okay . Well , did you go to college ? Yes , I did . And where did you go ? I went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia . Uh-huh . Uh , it was Sweeper College of about seven hundred and fifty students . I had gone to a small school growing up , uh , and a lot of my friends went to univert- , University of Michigan but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when I graduated and , uh , were looking for a southern school -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , also U of M seemed overwhelming in size and , uh , what about you ? I went to the University of Minnesota . Oh , so you 're from the Midwest , too . I am , uh-huh . Where do you live now ? Uh , I live in Texas now . Where are you ? Well , I 'm in Texas . I 'm in Austin . Oh , uh , my brother 's in Austin . Uh , he lives Lakeway . He , uh , had moved , uh , we 're in Plano . Uh-huh . 

And , I 'm familiar with Plano . I visited once or twice . Oh , Austin is so pretty . I -- Oh , I love it . 

-- really like it . I love it . I really do . And your daughter is going to be a sophomore . That 's correct . I have two daughters , but my oldest will be , will be a sophomore . Is , uh , because you live in Austin , is she thinking about the University of Texas ? She has her heart set on U T . And , uh , you know , having gone to the University of Minnesota , I know what a big university is like . And , uh , one thing that I did this summer , which I thought might benefit both my daughters is , my youngest daughter got involved in band , and Baylor has a band camp . Oh . So she went for a week , and it was overnight , and they lived in the dorms . And I thought this would expose both of them to what it 's , you know , like on a coll- , a smaller college campus . And , uh , my oldest one just was n't impressed at all with the idea of a small school . So , uh , I , I , I still think the exposure was good . 

Yes . The reason I ask if you went to college is I thought , well , you know , what were your selection criteria . Did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or , you know , there 's all of these areas to look at in making the decision . Uh-huh . Those , and those were several , uh , that we did consider . Uh , my parents , uh , certainly did n't push but wanted me to look in the south and because I had been in a small school , they suggested that I probably , I , when I say small , my graduating class had eighteen in it . Oh , wow . And so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one-on-one -- Oh , definitely . -- uh , or small group situations . And I did pick it because at the time I was interested in majoring in biology and -- Uh-huh . -- I also wanted to spend one year studying in Europe . Uh , I had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year -- Oh , how exciting . -- and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing 

and I ended up majoring in French . One of the reasons I picked the school was because they had a strong science department . They also had a strong language department and I 'd always loved working with children . Uh , and I found that I could n't fit everything in , but because I had had a fair amount of French going in -- Uh-huh . -- I was able to do my year 's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me . Uh , and so -- Oh , that was , -- that was some of , but -- That worked out very well for you . -- several of the things you mentioned were the things that , uh , our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M . He , but he thinks he wants to be a writer and I do n't think that , Well , then he should come to U T . Yes . Uh , and really his , his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand . Uh-huh . Uh , and so he 's used to a bigger size -- Large classes . -- and because my brother is there , uh , he would have family , close by . So there , there are advantages . Uh , but I also , because I had so many friends who did go from our small school to University of Michigan , which was so large and they really felt , uh , like they were numbers . Oh , I went from a large high school to a u- , large university and I -- You still , -- definitely felt like -- Yeah . -- I was a number . Uh , I mean , it is a different feeling . But that was , that was my only option . I , I mean , I just really could n't look at anything else . That was the one and only thing I could really afford other than a jun- , you know , a junior college , which I did n't want to do . So that 's how , you know , my decision was made . But , uh , Well , th- , that 's certainly , uh , especially today with the cost of college . I mean that is a , a major , uh , consideration and I do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools . And -- Yes . -- even though Baylor , uh , and when you mentioned that , we , we have friends who have children there who just love it . And for a private school it is not as expensive as most are and it is a smaller size and , uh , I do feel like there are a lot of options . It 's , it 's , but , I had been hoping some schools I know give , uh , oh , even this year , Jay had an aptitude test , uh , What , what does , he hopes to be a writer . Yes , he thinks that 's what he 'd like to do , but he 's really strong in math and science , too , and -- Huh . -- we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind . Does your daughter know what she 'd like to do ? Oh , she , she has , uh , you know , interests that are just , you know , going in all directions . Yeah . Uh , what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is , 

okay Bethany , let 's be real . Uh , she really is , is pretty unfocussed at this point . And , I do n't know , she 's taken a lot of French , and she may end up doing something with that . And I am a single mom , so I 've been , and I made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married . So I 'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake . And I 'm , you know , showing them if you 're strong in math and science , kiddos , this is one area where women can make some decent money . Yes . 

You know . 

I mean , I 'm kind of really putting the practical application , you know , and , and saying , yet , do something that you enjoy . Uh-huh . By all means , go get that piece of paper , you know . Do you just have one son ? Yes . I see . Well , it sounds like he 's got some really , you know , good strong ideas of what he wants to do . Well , he , but he has even , now that he 's in high school , uh , and , of course , there 's , there is still time , but he 's beginning to feel that , as much as he enjoys writing , he wonders if he can make a living at it . You know , it 's , the , it 's ,
