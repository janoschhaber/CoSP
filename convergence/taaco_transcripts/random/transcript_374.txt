MUMBLEx not be a very good conversationalist on fishing . I do n't do a lot of it . Well , I do love to fish . Well good , maybe I can learn something . Well , I do n't know how much you can learn . I 'm not so sure I 'm good at it , but I do enjoy doing it . Do you ? Yeah . Well , it is fun , what little I do . Of course , I do n't , you know , I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing I told my husband last night when I had called and they had , told me that this was a topic , I said , well , I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm . He said , I do n't think that 's the different kinds of fishing they 're talking about . Well , I hope it is , there 's not a whole lot of different kinds . That 's about the only kind I know how to do . I do n't do a lot of deep sea fishing , I , because I get seasick , but -- Uh-huh . -- we have a lot of lakes here in this area -- Uh-huh . -- and I do a lot of fishing for , uh , bass . We have a lot of , uh , uh , couple of lakes in our area that are fil , just filled with good sized bass . Uh-huh . And then when I get tired of them outwitting me , I fish for catfish -- Uh-huh . -- and we use worms and shiners , which is pretty much like minnows -- Uh-huh . -- a little bit bigger than minnows , and then I also use spinner baits and plastic worms . Uh-huh . It all depends on what I 'm fishing for , and the time of day . Well , it sounds like you do quite a bit of it . I do . Uh , there 's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here , and -- Uh-huh . -- it 's very convenient on afternoons when I want to just get away and sit and think . Fishing 's a good way to do that , and I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing . Do you have a boat ? No , I do n't . I have a friend who has a little infla , inflatable raft , and we -- Uh-huh . -- use that sometimes . Uh-huh . I wish I had a boat , but I do n't . I think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas . The ones around here are so big , that you can fish off the dock -- Uh-huh . -- but unless you have a boat you ca n't really get into the , where they call the good fishing holes , you know . Right . That 's the same way here , is n't it ? Is it ? You have to get back in the sticks in the , 

Uh-huh . My in-laws live on a lake , uh , a little bit east of Dallas , kind of in the Piney Woods , 

and the lake is beautiful , 

and I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish , but actually catching fish to eat per se , you do n't really do much of that right there . I catch a lot of little old , uh , I think they call them perch -- Right . -- and then the , the , uh , turtles try to eat up all my bait . Oh . So it 's , it 's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit -- We do n't have , -- but it 's kind of fun . 

We do n't have a big problem with turtles , but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes . Um -- And I , -- I would be afraid of that . Well , I ca n't think of a time that I 've been fishing that I have n't run into one or two of them . Do they ever get on your hook ? No , we , uh , occasionally I 'll catch an eel -- Uh-huh . -- on a , on a hook , but never the snakes . They just kind of , Are they poisonous snakes ? Uh , we have a lot of cotton mouth , so yes they are , definitely -- Uh-huh . -- and they live in little shallow , little coves that I like to fish in , so I seem them swimming by every once in a while . Yeah , I think I 'd be a little bit afraid of those . Yeah , they can , they 're , they 're certainly ugly . Uh-huh . We , uh , saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws ' place last year . It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know . Great big snake , and it , of course , it scared the women to death , you know , but the men come out and said oh , well , that 's only a , a king snake , it wo n't really hurt you , you know . But it looked so bad -- Yeah . -- and it was so big , that it might not would have hurt us , but we sure felt like it was hurting us , just being there , you know . Definitely . But they 're scary looking . Do you have bass ? Yes , uh , I think that , uh , probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else . Right . Well , that 's pretty much the same way here . Uh-huh . I , Now , they have a lot of bass tournaments . Well , we have those . I do n't -- Uh-huh . -- I inevitably , if I enter one of those , I never catch a thing . Oh , no . I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it . Uh-huh . Well that 's kind of , we 've never entered a tournament or anything . We 're not that big into fishing , but I see a lot of people , 

you know , early in the morning there 'll be all the boats going out , and they 'll say , Well , there 's a big bass tournament this weekend , and all those people are here for the tournament , you know . Oh , yes . 

So I think there 's a lot of people that have , you know , really , I guess that you 'd call it really sport fishing , they 're really into it to try to win . Yeah , oh , definitely . My . Certainly here they are . But it is , it 's very , a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around . The peace and calmness is really relaxing . Yeah , it 's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish . Uh-huh . That 's what I do a lot . I 've never tried taking a book with me . I 'll have to try that one of these days .
