How do you usually keep up with current events ? Normally I listen to C N N or HEADLINE NEWS about an , hour a day , and then I supplement that with , uh , radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week , Do you , and a newspaper if I have time . Yeah , 

I do n't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday , so I try to listen to the radio in the morning and , and try to catch one of the morning talk shows , and then I usually end up flipping through C N N and HEADLINE NEWS during the evening . I always try to read the Sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the , the week 's hot events . So , I try to , I try to catch that , if nothing else . That 's true , and , and how do you rate the , uh , h- , are you pleased with the news coverage that you 're receiving ? For , for local news I think we do real well where it 's , we live in a kind of small town , but I think we get excellent local coverage , um , and I like the national news that we see , we , we watch N B C and I think they do a real good job . So , I 'm , I 've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get , how about you ? On the whole , I 'm pleased when I have an opportunity to hear just the facts . I would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves . Um , since I do n't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite . Right . Uh , I think I 'm fed up with trite . There seems to be more and more of it , 

and I understand the void that , uh , comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations and a- , Uh-huh . as expensive as they are to produce , they certainly do n't want any dead airspace . 

Yeah , but I think there 's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us , and like you said , save the commentaries because I 'm going to listen to the , the news and draw my own opinions . I do n't really need their help to do that . I , wo- , I , we 're certainly in agreement there . I do n't think radio is as bad to do that as T V is . Radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done . They 're , maybe they 're a little more efficient , Uh-huh . or have more to do over that same time frame . Right . I do n't know which that answer is . Uh , I think the , my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like SIXTY MINUTES . Do you watch that ? I used to , but I do n't anymore , maybe once or twice a year . Well , I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES until they did two programs , uh , that I knew both the people and the inc- , incidences , Uh-huh . and I knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint , Really ? that was , in my estimate , nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings . Yes . And it , ever since that time I just do n't watch . Uh , so , I guess we have the , the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not . Yeah . Well , I had heard a couple of people , you know , that I had talked to about certain programs say that , you know , they had read other things besides what SIXTY MINUTES presented and that they did n't present it nearly the same way as the , you know , news articles or whatever they had , they had already been familiar with . So , I started questioning just how , how bias they really were , so . I do n't know di- , I do n't know how old you are , but it seems to me like the last , uh , newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that I wanted to hear was Walter Cronkite . Huh . So , I do n't , I do n't know if you 're familiar with him or not . No , not really , you know , in the last few years just his kind of informal segments I 've seen but I never got to see his actual nightly news . I liked , I , I did grow up with David Brinkley . Uh , Well , Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold , Uh-huh . of Cronkite and he did a , a pretty good job . THE HUNTLEY , BRINKLEY REPORT was quite excellent , Yeah , we , over the years . we used to watch , um , him and I guess , John Chancellor . And I always liked David Brinkley and I- , and I used to enjoy John Chancellor 's style of reporting , but on the nightly news , now , he goes into his commentary and that 's where I get , get into the problem with , with him . I frequently disagree with his commentaries , so . Well , once they 've reported the facts , all they can offer is an opinion anymore . Right . What did you think of the news coverage of the war ? Well , I almost felt like it was too much . Indeed , I found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day , one in the morning and one in the evening . Uh-huh . Uh , i- , I spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst , Really ? and I do n't need their fill-ins , you know . Did that help you understand a lot what was going on your , your prior experience with the military did , Yes , but I , I think it helps me everyday in trying to review wh- , the state that the world is in and try to guess where we 're going . 

I wondered if it would help you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people , people like myself might not pick up on . 

Well , I , I think , uh , my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES . Okay . What weekly , um , magazine do you look at , 

is it , I like U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT . At one time or another I 've taken them all for a year . Uh-huh . I believe in giving anything a chance . Sure . Uh , but I keep coming back to that one , so , I , that 's kind of my favorite . Does that give a pretty good overview of everything or like , does it give , um , I guess , little encapsulated reports and , and then a few big stories ? It 's primarily , um , a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports . Yeah . Uh , here 's what went on in Asia over the past week , and there 's maybe a page of that , little brief paragraphs , unless that was one of their , the focus of their main stories . That sounds good if you were short on time , you could get a summary real quick . Uh , it too is one those MUMBLEx in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways , and I do most of my reading in the bathroom . Right . Um , and it 's one of those that I can ei- , read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that I 'm going to spend in there . Right . And it just seems to fit nicely , so that I can get it read in about three days . Well , we 're working on a NEWSWEEK , uh , for the last couple of months we got , you know , an introductory subscription , so , we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like GLAMOUR or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED . So , we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us , so to speak . Well , to broaden your horizons , make you think about different things anyway . It ca n't hurt , . Well , anytime that we stop and think it ca n't hurt . No . I , I even , I enjoy reading T NEWS , I try to catch it because it 's another example , they just , they just show you the words and the facts and they , they do n't offer any commentary , and it gives me a quick chance to , to be caught up during the day . Because , you know , we do n't listen to the radio at work at all . So , I do n't like to go the whole day without hearing anything . Oh , I 'm with you , I have to check T NEWS every , every day . It 's my noontime dose of facts . Yeah , and the other thing we have that I like to check sometimes is , um , TALKING FINGERS , do you have that ? No . You have different telephone numbers that you can dial , and then you dial in an access code and it will , depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update , it will give you , um , updated information . So , that can give you , you know , current news updates , current weather updates , things like that and it 's , it 's offered through the local phone company free of charge . So , that 's , Huh . an interesting alternative occasionally that I like to use . Well , it does sound very interesting , It , maybe our phone company out here will get around to , It really is , offering something like that . yeah , it really is nice , I mean , because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk , and find out about . So , that is something you might keep your eyes open for , I think it 's , it 's catching on throughout the country .
