Okay , what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful . Have a big family , I guess , that 's a start . Well I guess so . Have you had any in the la , ha , well how old are you ? 

Twenty-five , so , Okay so you ha , I just got married . you have been to some family reunions , perhaps . Right , every four years on one side of my family they plan on having , uh , like my p- , grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids . Now how long in advance do they , uh , let them know ? 

Well , we plan on it , it 's like the third weekend in August , Uh-huh . so it 's every four years and so , So they all know it . Yeah and then , you know , arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know , um , food and who 's , who 's staying where , because a lot of people fro- , are from down here , in Texas . 

Uh-huh , uh-huh . And , uh , a lot of my family is in Indiana . That 's where I 'm originally from . Yes . So , um , we usually meet like at my uncle 's cottage in the , um , at the lake and , uh , make a couple days of it . Well that sounds like fun , do they all have the small children too , that come ? Yeah , pretty much . So all ages . Yeah and , uh , you know , there 's some my age and then there are some a lot younger , an , about four generations , I guess . Well my husband has , uh , on one side has an extended family , Uh-huh . and they do n't ever plan it li- , as , like you do . Uh-huh . I think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind so they have to start talking about it , or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody , 

Uh-huh . because they 're rather socially active too . Yeah . And so it has , it seems by doing it about six months ahead , they can pretty much get everybody there . If they do n't , you know , they 'll say , oh we 're planning to go so and so that , go to , to a certain place that weekend with somebody else and we 're already locked in but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them . Uh-huh . My family , uh , my parents are the youngest of very large families . Oh . Therefore , they do n't have many people left . Yeah . And , uh , the few previous ones I 've had , uh , I have n't known many of those people , but , uh , in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family and that 's been very nice , with , uh , I have one sister , Uh-huh . and three brothers and they 're only three out of five of us who have children . Oh . So , uh , we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other . Yeah . And that 's kind of nice because my husband 's family reunions are so large , Uh-huh . and they do n't see each other very often , we do n't really know many of them . Yeah , that 's kind of bad . It really is , they 're fun , they 're a lot of fun , Yeah . but , uh , still , uh , they 're not done on a regular basis and , uh , you kind of forget what happened , and who they were from the time before . Yeah , it 's , it 's fun getting together with immediate family . A lot of my cousins are real close and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that , so . Uh , those are the ones that are in Texas ? Uh , no , Or you go to Indiana on that ? the ones in Indiana , uh-huh . Uh-huh , where in Indiana ? Lafayette . Lafayette , I do n't know where , I used to live in Indianapolis . Yeah , it 's a little north of Indianapolis , about an hour . Yeah , yeah , it 's very pretty country in there I think , it 's gorgeous . Uh-huh , so . Well I , uh , when is your next one , uh , scheduled now . Well it 's like , the last one was my high school graduation the next one was when I graduated from college , so I guess about two more years . Yes , well , and do you think you 'll have a baby to take back with you . Uh , maybe , I do n't know , Maybe . two more years , I do n't know , probably . I mean you need another milestone , you know . Yeah , I guess that 's , that 's what , I mean I 've been married now for about nine months so that was another milestone , I guess . Yes , well I 'm sure , and ha , then all of your family probably has not met your husband . Um , yeah , he 's from Indiana , Oh , is he ? so they all met , yeah . And , and he 's living , you 're both living in Sherman . Yeah . Do you work to T I ? 

Uh-huh . Uh-huh , and does he ? No , he 's trying to get in med school , so . Uh-huh , well , we do n't either , 

but , uh , I have a friend who , uh , is working on this project . Oh , really . Yes , and , Are they getting all the data they need ? Well , I do n't know , uh , I , I have a hard time getting , uh , people on the telephone . Oh really . Uh-huh , getting through to anybody . Sometimes I call off and on all day , Huh . but anyway , uh , I guess we 're supposed to be talking about family reunions are n't we . But I got off that . Well we 've kind of exhausted everything I guess . Yes , well , um , I think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes . Oh , okay . And , uh , uh , we both look forward to going to our next reunions , I 'm sure . Oh yeah . But it has been fun talking to you . Well you too . Thank you . And maybe I 'll talk to you again . Okay , good . Okay , bye-bye . Bye-bye .
