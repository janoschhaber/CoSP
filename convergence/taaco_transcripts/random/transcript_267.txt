There you go . First question , 

do you own your house ? Uh , right , well , we try . I mean it 's a big mortgage in the sky and someday , maybe , we might even own it , but , um , for all practical purposes , I guess we hold the mortgage . Our name is on the till , Yeah , right . so that implies ownership . No one else has offered to pay for it . That 's right . I would not object if anybody did . Yeah , really they could move right into the spare room . Yeah . Well , we have , we have had this one for five years now . Before that we lived in Garland , uh , probably about , you know , four blocks away . Uh-huh . Liked the area , chose to stay inside of Spring Park . It 's a , uh , I do n't know if you have been up here , but it is a residential homeowners , Right , yeah , association . So , there 's a lot of , you know , activities , a lot of pluses and common land . But , uh , we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market , you know , it could not possibly have gone any lower and so we were wrong . Oh , five years ago . Yeah . 

Yeah , I think , what , it bottom out about a ye- , year later . Yeah , it , well , I mean just recently , I would say , I would give it two years back , when it was , I think , bottomed out . Oddly enough , two years , you know , I , uh , I think that , But , maybe not in your area , 

see , it was just different areas , not in , in , uh , this area . Cause this is about like the , That 's a really nice area . Yeah . Besides , it 's , you know , it 's not , it 's not Richardson . Is it ? It 's still considered Garland . No , it 's , it 's Richardson . Oh , ok , yeah . It 's , Richardson and , hold on a second . Paul , I can hear you perfectly , perfectly well , I do n't want to hear you . You are being rude . Whatever you ask or scream when I 'm on the phone , the answer is no . Do you understand ? How does that sound ? There you go . Write that one down . Yeah , there I go . 

It sounded good to me . Yeah , well , I hate to say how long that will last too . No , this area up here is , uh , all custom homes , and , Right . it 's , I do n't think that many by the builder that built this house . And , we were not the first people , the first owners , 

I think we are the third owners . Uh , okay . It was built by the architect for himself , who never moved into it . Who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep . Oh , no . Oh , yeah , caulking windows was a great mystery to them . Oh , gee . So , they just watched the water pour in on the carpet . But , it 's a Sharif Myneer Homes , if that means anything , it did not really mean anything to me except , I , I , I liked it . kept thinking of Omar Sharif every time I saw that name somewhere , so , He builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now . I think he got out of the lower end market . Uh . 

And decided , but , the houses here in , in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred . Oh , wow . Yeah , well but , still I know that this one was built for two ninety nine , which is nowhere near what we paid for it . Right . And I think somebody told me it 's also on a creek side lot , heavily wooded off the golf course . 

Oh , great . Yeah , and the guy around the corner is being transferred so he said , uh , well , he did comparables that it 's about eighty dollars , let 's see what , I do n't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot , Well off the creek and eighty on the creek , Yeah . or , if it was eighty and a hundred . Probably eighty . I think it was sixty , eighty . Sixty , eighty . I think . Well because , I know our , our little house over here stuck in the middle of , you know , the subdivision is , I think fifty five , so , I think the high end is definitely , you know somewhere there . Well , try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot . No , it could not be , because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet , and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars . Yeah . Just never . Well . Now , maybe , you know , that 's pretty close to what it would have sold for , uh , brand new , or that 's pretty much what it was built for . It 's got an awful lot of nice things in it but , you know , I do n't think , I think it 's going to be a long time , if ever , when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really , uh , desirable . It 's seems like people go for square footage only now -- Yeah . -- and , uh , cause . Have you been back to the Perry Homes , back here ? Um , the ones that look like brick houses ? The one that looks like Monopoly apartments . Right . Yeah , I think those are awful . I 'm sorry , I just do n't see the designer 's , I just see him as trying to squish as much space , you know , as much house into the space as possible . They are huge when you are inside them . Yeah . They are very spacious . They are , you know , I was , MUMBLEx I was in one today . It was forty two hundred square feet . Uh . Yeah . Uh-huh . Well see that 's , the house that we got is small enough so my husband and I , because there 's just the two of us and the two cats , um , can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard . And we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know . See , when you have kids , you like to be able to , Yeah , that 's true . send them some place where they can yell and you wo n't hear them . But , I have been watching these houses go up and I , I do n't , well , somebody was telling me , I know somebody who lives back there , I have always questioned the quality of construction and I , I do n't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house . Oh . When you watch them go up , you are just amazed that they do not fall over . Yeah . And it takes them something like , thirty days to complete a house . Oh , that 's amazing . Right now , in fact , even as we speak , we are having a deck put on in back , and these guys are phenomenal . They just , they , they are doing such a terrific job back there , I mean , you know , you pay for it too , but it 's , it 's like , really worth it . They are putting in a deck , Uh-huh . a redwood deck , 

and it 's just , they are doing such a fine , fine job . We have got -- I 'm really excited about it , -- three different levels of decking , because , 

Uh-huh . this lot slopes way back down and , uh , the house is built around the trees . Great . And with these decking that a corporation and a large MUMBLEx area for the trees to come up so , it 's real , real shady . But , that 's one of the few things that really , uh , immediately pays back on return . But , what I was going to tell you , these Perry Homes back there , Yeah . when the people from M C I come down and they are , you know , they are used to the Virginia area , metropolitan D C . Uh . My God , they come down here and those houses , that , that look the colonial look what the , Looks like the George Town brownstone . Right , Yeah . And , uh , the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it , for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars , Must be a dream . which is probably about what their equity is , that they got out of selling their house . Yeah . Because those things are selling like hot cakes . But , one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill , per month , last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars -- Oh . -- a month . And I thought , I ca n't MUMBLEx , MUMBLEx and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here . And I was thinking , well , you know , I know why your God damn bill is so high , He has no insulation , probably . it 's because there 's not a there 's no insulation , insulation in those things . Oh , my . Yeah . Gosh . What a trap . Huh . Any yet , you know , they , they show very well un- , they show very well unless you have , you know , lived in a lot of houses around the area , And you ask the right questions and can research , yeah . or looked at a lot of houses around here . Yeah . And I think that makes a big difference . But , I like , I like this area and everything that I have been saying , Oh , I do too . says that it 's , I think if we had to sell now , we could come close to breaking even . But , still , um , it 's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that . You 're in , you 're in the ,
