What vacations have you been on that you like ? Um , well I really enjoyed , um , I went to Mackinaw Island -- Right . -- a few years back . It 's in the middle of Michigan and -- Uh-huh . -- so that was nice . I like , um , driving to different cities because of the scenery , so that was nice . So you , most of yours is kind of driving and , Yeah , we 've , I 've been all over the states except for pretty much east . Um , it 's very pretty driving like , um , up north in Wisconsin too . Um , how , how far do you usually end , end up driving just , Um , the furthest I drove was probably Texas , and then I 've taken a train before to California . Now where , you 're from where ? Kenosha , Wisconsin . Oh , Wisconsin . Uh-huh . Okay . Yeah , I have a brother in Minnesota that used to live in Wisconsin . Oh . So , yeah , that 's quite a ways . Yeah , it is . I 've , uh , we went to California this last year -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , liked it , but it was too crowded -- Um . -- Walt Disney World , and other places , it 's just the wrong time of the year to go . Oh , yeah . And , uh , course , uh , you get in any of those tourist traps -- Uh-huh . -- and everything 's , uh , outrageously priced , 

and , uh , kind of , you wonder if they 're , it 's really worth it to pay , uh , thirty-five dollars or forty dollars just to get in . Yeah -- But , -- that 's true . There 's lots of fun places to see . Um , I think the scenery kind of , that 's something do to , you like to get up in mountains or , Oh , yeah , uh-huh . Do you have any mountains nearby ? No . Pretty flat , is n't it ? Yeah , yeah . Um , I think , uh , the biggest limitation is a lot , just time and money , is n't it . Oh , yeah . Yeah . What vacation have you enjoyed the most ? 

Uh , um . Probably , uh , when we go to Wisconsin MUMBLEx . Um , it 's pretty fun . There 's a lot to do up there . It 's pretty busy , though , you have to like crowds , you know . What is it ? Um , oh , it 's a , like a huge amusement park -- Okay . -- um , they have water slides -- Uh-huh . -- and it 's just a big , big tourist attraction . The downtown is all like little shops and candy shops and , it 's , it 's really neat . I do n't think , uh , hardly anybody lives there , because it 's just kind of like , you know , tourists . Probably a city in itself , kind of like , huh ? Yeah , it 's mostly a , a summer , summer place . Summer place . How far away is it ? Um , from Kenosha , it 's about three hours . Huh . It 's about a hour away from Madison . Okay , sure . 

Yeah , so -- Sure . -- that 's nice . It 's , it 's a pretty ride up there , too . I really like the city Wausau in Wisconsin . It 's really pretty . It 's nice out there . Oh , I like all the nature things there are to look at , you know . Right , well , and you can probably , you 're in a climate that 's kind of humid , so you have probably a lot of green , and lot of real pretty things . Our , our climate 's real dry -- Where is that ? -- and you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery . Most of , most , most of the land 's pretty brown . You do n't have as much of the greenery like you have . Oh , where 's that ? Uh , Idaho , is where I live , and , uh , MUMBLEx . Yes . Okay . It 's by , uh , I have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that I 'm on the phone . It 's by , um , Boise . You ever heard of Boise ? Oh , yeah , yeah . And , uh , it 's fine , it 's nice . 

It 's , uh , lot different kind of . I lived in Indiana for a while , and it 's a real different , uh , land and scenery than there . It 's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity , and -- Yeah . -- things like that . I think , uh , there 's a lot of places uh , oh , down , even in southern Utah , the canyons , canyon lands and Bryce Canyon and , oh , boy , they 're gorgeous -- MUMBLEx -- -- MUMBLEx . -- yeah . Those are kind of fun places . We usually go over to Bear Lake in the summer , which is kind of on the border of Idaho and Utah , and the lake goes on forever , and that 's real pretty over there too . Oh . But I think I 'm kind of a summer vacationer . 

Oh , yeah , me too , uh , me too . Unless I 'm going somewhere warm -- Right . -- for the winter . Right . 

Yeah , that 'd be nice . Where 'd you ,
