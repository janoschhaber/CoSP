What was one of the latest ones that you 've seen , actually ? Oh , I gue , I think we rented PRETTY WOMAN -- Uh . -- a couple weeks , months ago . Right . The last two years , I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home . I 've , uh , Uh-huh . uh , become available to come and go more often , so I said `` hey , it 's worth it , I 'll just go at the matinee hour and I can see what I please . '' Yeah . It 's no more costly than renting one . The last , see I went about two or three weeks ago and saw F X TWO and that is a really good movie , if you like special effects , kind of gory and lots of , you know -- Uh-huh . -- action . I have not done that one , I do n't know if I have even heard of that one . 

Um , do you know that I do n't follow performers , Oh . I do n't follow actors . Some I know , Uh-huh . some I do n't . Yeah . Uh , and he was the guy , the guy that played in it , he was not the star , but the one that played in it that I liked best was the one who was in , uh , oh , the one about the old people . 

COCOON ? COCOON , uh-huh . Okay . He was a blond haired , heavyset alien in COCOON . Oh , okay . I do n't , I do n't know what his name is . Uh , I think I know who you are talking about though . Yeah . At any rate , I also saw not long ago ONCE AROUND . That was with Richard Dreyfuss . Okay . And , that one was just a very poignant story , it , it , it had people , it was , it was you know , a lot of people said it was a really funny movie , but it was , Uh-huh . a very , it was a poignant humor and there was , it was like , uh , uh , STEEL MAGNOLIAS . The characters played very well off one another . Uh-huh . And there was humor involved , but the story was a very dramatic story , and I enjoyed it very much . What are some others that you have seen lately ? Oh , I 'm trying to think , uh , just the other night on H B O we watched THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER , Oh , whoa , yes . again and that 's one that , That 's one I can watch , Yeah . over and over and over again . I was going to read while it was on , but then when it started , I just could n't , you know , read . That was a really good movie . It sure was . And , you know , the second time you see it , you understand more subtleties in it . There are a number of good movies like that . Yeah , there 's quite a few , uh , movies out now that I would like to go see . My husband , Uh-huh . is not a real big movie goer , Uh-huh . and I guess , more than anything , that is why we do n't go . Yeah . Plus , by the time you get a baby-sitter , and then pay to go to the movies -- Uh-huh . -- it just gets pretty expensive . Right . You do n't work ? No , I stay at home . Okay . Well , you are going to have to find a mother 's day out and have him call in sick one day . Yeah . Go during the day , that 's right . That 's right . There 's nothing wrong with that . Go in the early hours , it 's a matinee , it 's not crowded and the price is as reasonable as renting a video . Yeah . And that 's the way I do it and I go quite frequently . Uh-huh . If you are going to be planning on doing that , now I was WARLOCK too , which is supposed to be the story of a , uh , witch hunt that is , you know , magically shot into the present time . Uh-huh . And , the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was , I was very well persuaded to walk out . Very well persuaded , there was more gore than I was interested in seeing . Uh-huh . But , as the movie settles down to a comfortable action , uh , I ca n't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either . But , Yeah . uh , the action was comfortable and , of course , I enjoyed those good guy , bad guy type conflicts things . So , I enjoyed that movie , after the first few minutes of gore . And there were some others , but they were done a little more tastefully . Yeah . But , uh , in the first scene , the warlock chopped off a guy 's finger because he wanted the ring and then -- Uh . -- bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet and I could not handle that . I said `` whoa , I 'm glad I have not had dinner '' . Then , uh , I saw AWAKENING , that 's a wonderful , wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro . I , uh , I , uh , Robert De Niro ? Robert De Niro , what did I say , Peter ? I think you said Peter . I said Robert De Niro . Yeah . 

And , he has done a really good job of characterizing the , uh , disabled person . Uh-huh . And , of course , Robin Williams always just has a , an air about him that you ca n't help but enjoy what he is doing . Even when he 's sad , you know , you great faith that he will get happy again . Uh-huh . And then , oh , let 's see , there 's a couple or three that I would like to go see before they go into videos . I guess , I can wait another month and they will be videos . Yeah . One is SILENCE OF THE LAMBS . I 've heard a lot about that one . They say if you really want to be , uh , you really want some suspense , that 's the one to see . And , I understand that 's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television . Uh . Well , you know , I think I read about that too . Uh-huh . And then THELMA AND LOUISE , I think it 's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie . It 's about time for one of those . I want to go see that . Yeah . And I 'm going to try to get in DANCES WITH WOLVES . Oh , you have n't , I 've heard that is wonderful . Uh-huh , I 've heard it 's wonderful too , but I , it 's just that they are both very long -- Yeah . -- uh , movies , and the matinee starts before I can get away from work . Oh . And , after , after that I get involved in other things and do n't want to -- Yeah . -- do n't want to go back . Yeah , I 've heard that 's , we , uh , we , uh , rented the other one , I was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately , uh , was PRESUMED INNOCENT , with , uh , Harrison Ford , I guess he 's in there . Uh-huh . And , I thought that was really good . You know , I saw that and I really I can not remember too much about it . 

It was the one where he was a defense , uh , not defense , he was a prosecu- , -cuter . Uh-huh . And there was a murder of one of the women that was in the , the D A - 's office . Uh-huh . And then he ended up being accused of it . Oh , that 's right , I remember now . Yeah , I remember . Yeah , so , I mean it really kind of had a turn at the end , when you found out who it was . Uh-huh . Well , I 've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies . I think he ought to stay Indiana Jones . I realize that he would like his career to develop , but I do n't want to see him in other things . But , uh , I tell you , Sean Connery in the HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER , I , I never did care for him as , in the James Bond movies . I do n't know he was too . 

I was never into those movies , either . Yeah , 

I did n't care for the type of movie , but he was always slick , and greasy , and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed and I did n't like him . But , he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older . Yeah , I thought he looked real good with a beard , too . Oh , yeah , yeah , he does and there is just a , there 's a , I do n't know , uh , I think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning , whether he is or not . Yeah . And he , he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time . And , I enjoy those , and I enjoy some of the Michael J . Fox movies . I did n't care too much for the last one either . It just was not enough to it . 

What was the last one ? I 'm trying to think . Uh . 

Uh , the last , like , BACK TO THE FUTURE then was the last one . No , no , no , it was called , uh , HARD WAY , where he was an actor , trying to portray -- Oh , okay , -- trying to portray , portray a policeman . 

And that ,
