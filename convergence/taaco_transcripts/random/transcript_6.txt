Hi . Hi , um , okay what , now , uh , what particularly , particularly what kind of music do you like ? Well , I mostly listen to popular music . I , uh , listen to it all the time in , in my car , so , I , I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because I do n't like commercials . But , Yeah . uh , I find myself listening to popular music , and , uh , quite honestly , I , I have some little children and I , unfortunately , found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately , but that 's not by my choice . Oh , really . How about you ? Well , um , I do n't have that , I do n't have that , experience to share . Lucky you . I , I do , I do listen to a lot of , you know , I do , I switch the stations a lot because I do n't have a cassette player in my car . Um , um . Uh-huh . Uh , uh , however , I , I do , I do like a lot of different forms of music so I switch quite often . Um , I think I like , I , I 'm really particular about the type of music that I listen to . Uh-huh . But , the , uh , there 's such a wide selection , I think I like a lot , I like a little bit of a lot of different types of music . You know , I , I , I like music that is , that I feel if it is performed correctly or if it 's done right , or if the version is done right , I like it , Yeah . but , if , if it 's not , then I wo n't . I , I really do n't , How do you feel about rap music ? Rap . It seems to be so popular these days . Yeah . Well , I , I do n't really have anything against rap music . I , the one thing I do object to about rap music is , is when it becomes militant , Uh-huh . or , if it 's , uh , violence oriented . Right . I , I have strong objections to that . Um , actually I listen to , one time I remember , this was back when , even , uh , I would say about ten or fifteen years ago I , When it was really just starting . Yeah , right when it was just starting , Yeah . I heard what was called talking blues , Uh-huh . which actually is rap . Uh-huh . And , uh , it was about , the , the piece of music , the piece of music was about , I think about forty or fifty years old . And , it was incredible , I mean , the parallel , you know , between it and rap . Right . And , um , you , you listen a lot , if you , if you hear a lot of old gospel , uh , uh , especially well , the black gospel . 

You know , you will , you know , you can really pick it up . I mean , Yeah , you really . It seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music . A lot of times you 'll hear songs that you know , they 're not original , Yeah . but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm . And , uh , sounds , it sounds so much different and yet , I , I have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music and , uh , she thinks it 's pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she 's listening to , and yet , Yeah . she thought they were brand new , Yeah . original pieces . 

they , they do , they do copy versions , they do cover versions of , of , you know , like standards , I guess you could call it . That 's right . I think it 's kind of absurd , you know , the fact that , you know , they do n't really , they do n't really give , you know , the original artist , or the original composer , No . the credit that is really due to them . Yeah , I guess there was even a , a bit of ruckus caused by the M C Hammer , who 's really , you know , Yeah . seems to be the hot one of , of today . He used , um , WILD THING . Do you remember that , that song . Yeah . 

he used , um , I ca n't remember who the artist was on that . Jimi Hendrix was the original . Who ? Jimi Hendrix was the original . He wrote , Was it , well , ma- , maybe it was n't that one . Because , it was a living , it was a living person that I 'm , I 'm thinking of that , Okay . um , that said , `` You know , hey that , those are my words . '' And , uh , I guess that they , because they had n't originally gotten , um , permission , Uh-huh . from him to use it . And , he , he since then has , has amended that , and paid them his royalties every time the , the song goes on but , Yeah . I do n't know it may have , it may have been somebody else , because I think , I think that even Jimi Hendrix did it , I think that was a cov- , you know , come to think of it , I think that was a cover version of , like a John Lee Hooker song , or something , Maybe so . I , I mean it was just like , it was really old . I , ca n't think . I mean I , I , there are a lot , there are so many different songs , I mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times . I mean I 've heard some songs that , that I just thought were horrendous cover versions of , I 'm like , you know , I , I do n't want to listen to this . Yeah . Because you know , you think of the original is like , 

you know , oh , that was really great . That was a , you know , a really good piece of work , and then when you hear the cover it 's like , you know , God , what are they doing . Right . They destroyed it . I , I think a good one was , um , there was a Peter Frampton song , Oh , yeah ! and , then the cover version , I think , I mean , I thought , was absolutely , it was pitiful . I , I remember seeing the video of it on M T V , and I thought it was hideous . Yeah . I did too . It was , ugh , I did n't like that either . Yeah , but you know , whatever became of Peter Frampton . 

I mean , there was nothing , 

he was a phenomenon , I me , there was no reason for him to really come into , you know , great stardom or anything . I remember , I saw him in a concert , when I was , Yeah . Yeah , I think , I think it , I think it was in high school . Yeah , I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer . Uh-huh . He was very good . I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in , uh , Philadelphia . It was in J F K Stadium , if I can remember . Oh man . Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like . Yeah . I 've , I graduated back in seventy-nine , so , Um , um . Uh-huh . but , but I 've really , I , I loved , I mean , I was , I was really into the album oriented music , even then , Uh-huh . so I was really familiar with a lot , with a lot of , of the A O R type music . Um , the album oriented like the , uh , James Taylor , 

Oh , yeah . and , the , uh , the Beatles , and you know , I mean , a lot of people they go , they 're better than the Beatles , and I 'm like , you know , you do n't know what you 're talking about . No . I mean , the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles . It was just , You can only laugh . Yeah , you just sort of , you know , well I guess I can just humor them , you know . At this point . Right well , they , 

I guess our age is showing when , we , we think that . Yeah , but well , you know , I , I , I 've liked a lot of the new music . I think , um , Uh-huh . um , when I saw some promise , you know , with , with a lot of the new wave , when it , when it came out , uh , Yeah . 

back in the mid and early eighties . And then , um , I do n't know music is kind of in a weird , it 's in a very weird position right now . I think that , I mean , I like , you know , things like to hear , you know , what they call world music . Which is , you know , using all these natural forms of music and , Like Paul Simon . Like , Yeah , yeah , Paul Simon . Yeah . Well , you know , really that 's not world music . But , what , what Paul Simon 's doing , I think is , is , is great because he 's , you know I think , I think that using , I guess what they call it is eclectic , you know . 

Yeah . drawing from a lot of different sources and making , you know , a synthesis of a new type of music . Um , What do you mean by world music ? Well , world music is , um , a lot of the , a lot of where they , where they make music that they adapt to a , to another kind of , to another type of listener . Uh-huh . Uh , for example , let 's say you 're taking like an original Brazilian form of music and , with a certain style , and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for , let 's say another audience , let 's say a North American . Uh-huh . And , then when they hear it , it , it 's a really , it 's another form of music , and , Um . you know , sort of , um , trying to draw out the best sources . The , the best of every type of music . Right . Because , I mean , there are some , I mean , I , I li- , there are some , you know , types of heavy metal that I really like , but , but I would n't , I would n't say that I , I completely like heavy metal . No . I , I think , you know , and it 's the same way with , you know , world music takes the forms that have really been , um , I guess , I you know , the best example or , you know , the cream of the crop , I guess you could say , and then , and then taking those , those qualities , and then applying , in the styles , that are really , um , that are extremely enjoyable , and then taking , So then it becomes a kind of music of , of its own , so to speak , or , uh , 

Yeah , yeah , it becomes a kind of music of its own . I mean , when you listen to it , it 's um , uh , I think that they do n't use , elec , some of it , it 's , they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably , Uh-huh . so , you know , well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now , and from West Africa , that 's considered world music , because it 's not particularly using certain types of folk styles . Right . But , they 're , they 're trying to make it somewhat more modern . I , I , I , a good , another good example was I heard Miles Davis , and Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar , Uh-huh . if you can believe it , I mean , Uh-huh . You know , he 's a jazz performer , and then he 's playing with Robbie Shoncar , who 's a very good , he 's a very good arranger . Uh , arrangement to , uh , we 're going to have to get off . The , are they trying to MUMBLEx , I do n't know . But , uh , MUMBLEx We 've talked our five minutes though . Yeah , okay , but , I mean , when I heard his album , I heard it and it was just incredible . I 've been listening to that a lot lately . Yeah , I , I listened and , I heard , you know , you hear this guitar , and then you hear the muted trumpet . I me , and you never would think that they , that they can actually play together but , Oh yeah .
