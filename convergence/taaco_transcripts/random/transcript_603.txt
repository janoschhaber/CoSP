Wha , what sort of company do you work for ? Do you work for a big or a little place ? Uh , I work for Georgia Tech . Yes sir . I work for the research facility . Uh , and it 's , it 's kind of small in a sense but it , it does have , about , uh , I guess , two thousand civil employees . Uh-huh . And , on a , a scale , I guess it 's still considered small . It just have a lot of different laboratories . Uh-huh . The area I work in , it , it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so . Uh-huh . So that 's make up most of the laboratory so from , from that standpoint , it 's pretty small -- Uh-huh . -- it 's pretty small . What about yourself ? Huh . Well , I , I work for , uh , actually probably similar kind of place . I work for , uh , Lincoln Laboratory . Oh , okay . 

Uh , yeah . We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech . Oh , okay . I see . Uh , and , uh , so we 're , we 're part , we 're actually part of M I T . So it 's very much the same kind of place and , uh -- Oh , okay . -- the technical institution . Right . Uh , Uh , while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to , trying to think of what , uh , uh , what things were important , uh , besides salary and a , and a job . I guess , uh , MUMBLEx list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the , uh , the challenge of the work and , uh -- Uh-huh . -- the working conditions , things like that . Right . I do n't know . What are your , uh , what sorts of things would you consider important ? Well those and probably the security aspect of it . Uh-huh . Because a lot of time nowadays , even though you 're working , uh , you 're treated , 

and it may not be true in every place . In a lot of cases I think you 're treated more like a number instead of a , a person . Uh-huh . Because when it come down to layoff , they do n't really consider people and , and , you know , their well being as far as , you know , how they going , their next dollar going to come in . How they going to pay their bills . They just lay them off . Yeah . And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had , uh , I think the company still exists . What they use to do is , they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off -- Uh-huh . -- you know . That way that , you know , one person would n't get one big blunt blow at one time . Uh-huh . 

And , uh , you know , I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better , you know , other than s- , you know , something like , unemployment is good but I mean the company as a whole because you as an employee , even the company is making money , they paying you a salary 

but you are responsible for that company growth . You 're responsible also for helping that company get to the par- , point that it 's at at making profits . So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than , you know , uh , neglect or something like that . Uh-huh . You know . Because it 's not a person 's fault that , you know , people not buying or businesses are , are not on the up and up all the time , you know . I do n't see how one or two people , maybe more one or two , but , you know , a number of people can , can be the downfall of com- , a company situation . Now how do you mean that ? I know it , Well in a sense that say , how do you make a , a conclusion that you 're going to lay off these ten people . Uh-huh . Uh , for the bad times of the company . What about the , the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well . Uh-huh . You know . In that standpoint . Well , you , you think it 's better than to , to try to spread the , the effort equally among all the employees of the company or , Ye- , yes , I do . Uh-huh . I really do . I think it 'd be better that way and even at that , it would at least give the person time to look for another job because -- Uh-huh . -- they know that MUMBLEx that there are problems and , you know , there are reason to look for another job -- Yeah . -- instead of just dumping it on them all at one time . Uh-huh . You know . That 's just , that 's my views , you know . Yeah . I 've heard of a couple of companies that have done that . I think , uh , back about , a few years ago when things were tough , Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile . They went to a , uh , a , a four and a half day work week rather -- Right . -- than cut , yeah , just cut everybody back ten percent . Right . And , uh , have to , give everybody a half day a week off . Right . And I think you can do that for a little while but I 'm , Well at least that would give a person a chance to look -- Yeah . -- you know . Because the way it is , a person really do n't have a chance .
