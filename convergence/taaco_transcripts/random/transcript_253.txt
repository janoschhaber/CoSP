Well , Wayne , I , uh , feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children , and making time available even sometimes when time is n't available . How do you feel about it ? Well , yeah , I feel much the same way . I 've , uh , two kids right now -- Yeah . -- one is two and a half and one 's nine months , and , uh , that age , of course , everything you do they 're trying to learn to do , and so , uh , it 's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn , you know , that , that they need to learn at the age , you know -- Yeah . -- reading , and , uh , reading and playing nice with others , and that sort of thing . Yeah , we went through this with our children , and now with our grandchildren , and I 've always tried to do things with them , uh , like , when you 're at the little league , helping out even though I 'm not a good athlete myself , I was able to help the coach in , in just controlling the kids , if nothing else , and we 've always , uh , oh tried to take our children and no- , now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to . I think that 's just part of their overall educational process , is to get out and see and do things . Right , uh-huh . Yeah , yeah . And so , it 's uh , we have , uh , lived several places around the U S and we have , where we 've lived , we 've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area , like when we lived in Tennessee , we , we took them to Washington , D C to see all the capitol and , and things like that when they were small . And it 's just , uh , it 's helps , I think , the children to , when they 're learning in school , to say , well , I 've been there and I 've seen that . Right . Yeah . Uh-huh . Yeah , So , uh , that 's the type , Yeah , it certainly does , because , uh , you know , the things in the books seem so dead to the kids , you know , unless they 've actually been there or whatever , because I remember our family , well , we , we , we went everywhere . And , uh , seeing New England and , uh , being on Plymouth Rock and stuff like that was -- Yeah . -- really made the whole thing more , uh , visual . Yes . And we could , uh , read the things in the history books and understand what they said , when it was like , we need food , we need to raise food quickly -- Yeah . -- because this place gets very cold very soon . Yeah , we 've , uh ,  gone through that , uh , I remember my parents did n't do all those type things , and so I made a special effort with my children to do things like that . And even now with my grandchildren , I feel it 's a very important thing to be done . Right , because if , uh , kids do n't look up to you , or , or , ca , ca n't feel they can spend time with you , they 're going to find someone else -- Yeah . -- and uh , you know , nowadays there 's a lot of people out there that you do n't want your kid to , emulating or whatever . Yeah . Well , I can remember one of the things I 'm most proud of is , uh , when my son was , I think it was in the sixth grade , they had to write a , a little brief autobiography of themselves , and about what they had done and what they wanted to do , and I was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to , uh , have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him .  A real point of pride with me . Yeah , that is nice . Yeah excuse me , it sounds like we both have colds . Yeah , well , it 's , um , well , it 's , uh , ten o'clock here in Falls Church , Virginia . Oh . So that the only reason I 'm home is because I 'm home with a cold . Oh , well , we 're And the wife says , Well , you need something to do , 

talk to a guy on the phone . Yeah , well , I 'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of Dallas , Texas .  So , we 're kind of far apart here . Yeah . This is a very interesting program I , I heard about here on this , and when I signed up for it , it , uh , looked like it could be , make a real contribution in participating . Right . Yeah , I 'm an electrical engineer by trade -- Yeah . -- uh , here in Virginia . Likewise , we , uh , we do some projects every now and then . We like to get support from , uh , other , other companies as well . Yeah . I 'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan . 

 So , Trying to work myself out of a job .  But , it 's been an interesting , uh , roughly , oh , nine months here , and , uh -- Oh . -- again , this is our home area . 

We 've lived here about seventeen years , and it 's , uh , we enjoy living here . It 's where we originally started out , and we 've lived up north for a while in Chicago and over in Tennessee . So , wound up back about two hundred miles aware , away from where we started out . Yep . Well , uh , that 's about all I can think to talk about right now . It 's been a pleasure talking with you . Okay . 

Thank you . Right . Bye . Bye-bye .
