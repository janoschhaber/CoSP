Actually , to tell you the truth , I think , uh , jury selection is a , uh , prime , uh , discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on , uh , uh , finding of , uh , guilt . Uh , I certainly ca n't argue with that . Definitely does need some improvements . Uh , and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to . Yeah , I think there 's a limit on that . The , uh , the , uh -- I think it 's , -- peremptory challenges are limited to , I do n't know how many , but you can , Four or five , I ca n't remember which . I was on a jury trial last year only I got kicked out as , uh , the last selection that the , uh , defense got . Um . Yeah , it seems to me I 'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things . I think I have a severe demeanor or something . 

Um . Uh , That , uh , But , typically , you know , basic- , uh , typically , uh , everyone gets involved in , uh , the jury process and I suppose an elitist might say , well , you really want someone who is well educated to be able to , to winnow the facts from the , from the prejudice . Right , but it still has to be a group of your peers . Right . See . So , So , if it 's your peers and you 're not educated -- So if you 're a -- 

-- then , -- nincompoop on trial , you 'd , you 'd have to have -- You want -- -- nincompoops to , uh , -- you want a nincompoop jury because they 'll sympathize with you a bit -- Um . -- as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them . So , that 's why the defense is there picking through them , whereas at the same time , the , uh , the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him , uh , a guilty verdict if the facts warrant . Uh-huh . So , uh , I think the jury selection process is pretty neat , but I do n't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment -- Um . -- afterwards . I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have . M- , you 're talking about , the person 's already been found guilty , right -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- and many times I 've seen on trials they have on T V , the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever , but I think that it should be up to the judge and the , uh , lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be . Um . Maybe just the judge because they 're the people who know what the system is -- Uh-huh . -- and what it 's all about -- Uh-huh . -- and believe in the system . Uh-huh . Uh , and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure . Well , I suppose you may be right on that . As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure . Matter of fact , I 've heard that , Also , may be a more consistent sentencing procedure . I 've heard that some of the information , uh , is prevented from reaching the jury , like , uh , mitigating circumstances or , or preceding , uh , criminal record or things of this nature that , Well , preceding criminal record , according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime . But when it comes to , uh , sentencing for punishment , of course , if the person 's never done anything bad before , according to the judicial system , then they 're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side , and the jury 's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury . Oh , is it ? Oh , I did n't realize that . Okay . At least in California , they 're supposed to be . Not during the trial , during the trial as to whether they 're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background . Right . But when it comes to what kind of sentence you 're going to lay down , I think that , uh , that they should . Uh-huh . 

I do n't , I do n't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial . They get too boring . Uh-huh . So , you , what you 're saying is this , if there is the second offense , then you execute them . Well , if it 's a second offense , the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense , because obviously , the rehabilitation process did not work the first time . Um . So you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better . When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing , I 'm all for that for , uh , small crimes , infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant , you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things . What about , uh , white collar crimes like , uh , theft of trade secrets . I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are . Oh , really ? Yeah . Like what ? Well , uh , say , embezzlement , right . Ri- , You get a guy down the street who comes up , uh , carrying a kni- ,
