Why do n't you go ahead and start . Okay . Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement . Uh , trial by jury is good but a lot of time i- , a lot of cases , uh , is circumstantial evidence that , that convicts a person , which I do n't think is all the time good . Because sometimes it 's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent , I mean prove a person guilty if you do n't really know or you do n't really have an eyewitness . And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me . I do n't know . So you think if , if trials were held by judges or experts , that they , they would tend not to , uh , admit , not to convict people on circumstantial evidence ? I think so . You know , I , I attended a trial in , uh , Germany when I was a student and , uh -- Uh-huh . -- that 's the sort of system they have . The trials are held by a panel of three , uh , three or four judges who are , well , they 're like lawyers I guess . They 're experts in the law -- Right . -- and , uh , there , there really is n't a jury and , uh , uh , they do the questioning also . The judges do the questioning and , uh -- Uh-huh . -- they , uh , i- , I think it 's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they , uh , uh , the judge is also sort of a jury , uh , but I 'm not sure I like that . 

I think I prefer the jury system myself . You think you prefer the jury ? You think your chances are better ? Uh , well , actually I think in most criminal cases it would n't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury . What , what I worry about is cases where it 's the government against the individual . That 's where you really need a jury of peers . Well , that 's true . Because , uh , anytime th- , the government , uh , is the government against the individual you need som- , y- , you need the protection of ordinary citizens . I think that 's really the only thing . I guess where I would like to see the system change is , uh , uh , there ought to be a , a well I guess I do n't think that , uh , uh , juries need to decide sentencing all the time . Uh-huh . I think maybe th- , a judge is a better judge of that or , uh , Well , s- , sometimes the sentencing is still , is not fair . I mean even if , well the jury , I guess they do decide that but , but , I 'm like you , in a case like that , most of the time its , 

I do n't know , 

maybe I 'm too , too , uh , uh , conservative when it comes to that . Th- , the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases -- Yeah . -- you know , uh , Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom , I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone 's guilty or innocent . That 's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe . Right . But people who d , do n't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are , to ask them to decide for one case , on one person , based on what they see , I think that is maybe , uh , a little bit naive . Yeah . In Texas here , people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people . Uh-huh . Uh , it 's kind of , uh , uh , a hanging jury atmosphere . Right . But in a lot of places , I think people bend over the other way , but I guess , I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he 's , goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it . Some , some cases in some jurisdictions , they can do that . Oh really ? I kind of like that system . Yeah . Yeah . That 's , that 's not a bad system . But I , I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit . Yeah . But , the thing is too , maybe they need more of a , I do n't know , more of a expert types -- Yeah . -- to , to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick , you know , Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever -- Right . -- an- , and call them in . And lawyers blow sand in their eyes . MUMBLEx exactly . I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries . Right , exactly . Insurance cases and things like that . Yeah . Where , and , uh , there would be more honest settlements instead of this , uh , tugging of people 's heart strings and , uh -- -- making them cry and feel like they 're doing somebody good by giving them -- -- or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering . Uh-huh . Exactly , exactly . So . In , I think , i- , in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government but ,
