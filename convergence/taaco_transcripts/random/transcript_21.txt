All righty . Uh , I 'll just hand it off to you and hobbies in our spare time is what we 've been selected to discuss today . 

Well , uh , the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time , are crafts and , uh , I 've been involved in making , uh , hat stands and , uh , rag dolls and , uh , different type hats with , uh , flowers and roses , you know , and , uh , that kind of thing , straw hats and , Oh . all that kind of stuff . And I enjoy it , it 's relaxing . And you kind of get absorbed in it so the time goes by , you know , before you realize anything is going on . And I play the organ sometimes , uh , just for my own satisfaction . Not for anybody else 's ears because I 'm not that good at it , but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while . Oh really ? How about yourself ? Well , oh , hobbies , gee whiz , I guess I got too many hobbies so I never have time to deal with them . Really ?

uh-huh . you know , and spoil them , first one , you know how that is . And , um , uh , I play the guitar and a banjo . I mainly play the guitar a lot , I play about every night . And , um , I really love that , if I had a druther , if I could have , if I could make it on the road , I 'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something , because that 's , I 've , Oh , that sounds nice . I like bluegrass , too . yeah , I 've done it before and when I was in hi , in high school and college , Uh-huh . and thoroughly enjoyed it , and it 's really a , a blast . My wife hates it , but that 's the way life is , I guess . That 's the hard part , right ? Exactly . If you can do things together , that really helps a lot . MUMBLEx yeah , we , uh , she 's , uh , into aerobics , and , uh , Oh , that 's good , too . and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half and that went over real well , Uh-huh . but , uh , that 's about it there .

We do that too , we have a , uh , a treadmill and , uh , a bicycle and that kind of stuff , we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week , you know . Oh , that 's great .

It 's really kind of fun . It is . It really is . Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty , yeah . Yeah , exactly . I like things that , you know , two people can do , but I like the quiet of doing things away , you know , kind of gives you some space for yourself , and that 's what I find in making the dolls and things , that it gives me something that I can create , and I like to crochet and knit . I made some afghans and that kind of stuff . I like doing things with my hands . Uh-huh . Sounds like it . Yeah . Do you like to cook ? Yes , I love to cook .

We did , MUMBLEx I did horseback riding , too , in fact , when my children were growing up , we always had horses and , uh , that was kind of for them , 

but they were n't as interested in it as we were , you know , so , uh , that was a real , I 'd say probably for maybe fifteen years , we dabbled in that , you know , we always had horses around , and I really enjoyed that , Oh , that 's great , sounds like you , and I was disappointed when I went to Texas . I did n't see that many of them . Horses ? Yes . Yeah , you really do n't . Yeah , th- , the ,
