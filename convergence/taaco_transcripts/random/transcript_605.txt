I , uh , try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of -- -- repair . Actually , uh , that is really a sore spot with me . I , I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving but , uh , like ten years ago , uh , reliability of automobiles , at least U S automobiles was pretty dismal 

and not only that , but the , uh , repair capability of , uh , service departments and dealerships was equally dismal -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea . Yeah . But , uh , I , So do you have a car ? Pardon ? Do you have a car ? Well , at that time , actually , I had a Volkswagen Rabbit -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , it was , it was a real lemon . Uh , subsequently I got a , uh , Buick Century and it was n't as bad . Uh-huh . But , uh , last year I bought a Honda Accord and I take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance and that is it . And it 's wonderful . Yeah . We used to have a Honda Accord and they 're good . They 're really good cars . Every time I get taken to an auto repair place , you know , every time I go , I get taken . Bad -- Huh . -- you know . Woman goes in and they go all right , we got a sucker . Let 's ge- , see how much money we can get out of her , you know . Huh . That 's what happens every time . Huh . Uh , so , So , wha , what do you have ? I have a Pontiac Six Thousand . All the more reason to , uh , have a , a Honda . Yeah . But our Honda just got old and just wore out . It was , let 's see , eleven years old and it just , just out of it D- , so you bought a Pontiac ? huh-uh . My hu- , uh , ex-husband 's , this is , just happened a couple of weeks ago . He 's my ex-husband 

but just a few months ago when he was my husband , uh , his father gave us this car and everything is wrong with it . I mean , the power steering fluid leaks , the oil leaks , the brake fluid leaks , you know , Now thi- , wha- , how old is the car ? Uh , eighty-seven . Huh . And he just does n't take care of things and but I was awarded the car so . There is a man in my church that is a mechanic and I can trust him . So he is trying to get , you know , things fixed on it . Huh . 

But it 's just , you know , leak , leak , leak everywhere . But , uh , you know , I hate to go into a , a repair place because they 'll tell me something is wrong with it and it 's not , you know , and charge me twice as much . The last time I took it into a repair shop , the man told me I needed a master cylinder . So I said okay . And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars and then , uh , about a month later , a man was looking at my car and he asked me , you know , not a man , not a repair man , but just a friend and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on and he looked at and he said that 's not a new master cylinder -- Huh . -- and I did n't even know what one was . And , uh , he showed it to me and it was old , rusty , just awful . It was no more new than nothing . So apparently it was the same one that was on there . Uh , more than likely . Apparently just , uh , re- , re- , uh , probably filled the , the brake fluid up and that was it . That was it , probably . It was ve- , I was so irritated . And that 's happened to me more than once or twice . Jus- , just , just about every time I 've went in somewhere . So what 's the solution to that ? I guess find a reputable service , And , and you ju- , can hardly find one , you know . Huh . The guy that 's doing most of my , my car now , uh , goes to my church 

and that 's the only reason , you know , I go to him -- Uh-huh . -- because I know him and I know he will tell me the truth . Because he does n't even charge me for , for doing it so he 's not going to , you know , take me . Right . I just pay for the parts and he does it so . Well that 's wonderful . Yeah . You 're lucky . Yeah , I am , so , I do n't know . I do n't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car , they 're usually the worst one of all . We took our Honda to the Honda dealership and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car . Oh , really ? Yeah . And so , idiots as we were , neither one of us knew much about cars , we , you know , they told us we just had to have one and we bought one . We did n't no more need no new engine , give me break , you know . Huh . So it was , it was not good and , uh .
