Well , actually my hobbies now are T shirt making . I 'm making T shirts and sweat shirts . In fact that 's what I was doing when you called . Well , that sounds interesting . What kinds of , uh , sweat shirts and T shirts do you make ? Um , right now I 'm making Christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and -- Okay . -- all that kind of thing . Is that silk screening , or , Um , no , I 'm , have material that I cut out , and then you , um , there 's this stuff called Wonder Under that you un- , that you iron it on and then you iron that on the T shirt , and you paint around it . Oh , I see . So , it 's real fun . I started doing it as a , um , just something fun to do , and now I 'm selling them and pretty , Well , how 's it going ? Pretty good . I just started last week , and I sold seven . I did n't , was n't expecting that , so , Well , that sounds great . I guess in my spare time I 'll be making T shirts . So .

Well , what are your hobbies ? Well , I , I kind of have hobby fads , I guess . Uh-huh . When I was growing up I was , was into coin collecting , and that dropped off about the time I hit puberty , I guess , and then , my hobbies in high school went just to the sports . Now my latest one is classic cars . I 've -- Um . -- I had a sixty-six Mustang I was rebuilding . Almost had it done , and I went on , went ahead and sold it . Oh , my gosh . But it was fun . I really enjoyed it . Well , how 'd you learn to do that -- Oh , you just , -- to fix them up ? You just get a book that tells you how to do it or what ? No , you just kind of , all I did is , uh , I bought the car and then , uh , you know , you can , I , uh , was just in a supermarket and I seen a , a magazine for , you know , basically it , it was called MUSTANG MAGAZINE and -- Uh-huh . -- and so I bought it and they had , uh , some names , some companies that sold mustang parts , and I just started ordering some parts and , and , you know , basically , you know , I , what I did was , I redid the whole interior . 

I did n't do too much to the engine , because the engine was pretty good , but the , the whole interior and then part of the exterior , just kind of do it . Where 'd you get the car ? Well , we lived , we lived in South Dakota , and I bought it up there before I moved down here . Wow . So it was , it was kind of rusted out there , there is n't too much rust on any vehicles down here . Well , that 's true , that 's true . Well that sounds neat . Well , gee I guess there really is n't too much to talk about on hobbies . Let 's see . That , that about covers mine and T shirt making about covers yours . Well , let 's see , I 've done other hobbies . I 'm a hobby person . I 've always done a lot of craft stuff .

Do they all play different songs -- Uh-huh . -- or do some of them play the same song ? They , they all play different songs . Well , that 's neat . What 's the most expensive one you bought ? The most expensive . I do n't know . I 've gotten all of them for gifts . I do n't -- Oh , really . -- MUMBLEx bought a few of them . I usually get them for Christmas gifts or , and like when people go , you know , to , on trips or something . Well , that 's interesting . It used to be tea spoons , was the thing . That 's true .

and , um , and I did that when I went to Europe one summer . I bought a doll everywhere we went , so . Well how was Europe ? MUMBLEx economy . It was great , it was quick . I was in , I was in high school , and I was in a tour , and we went all , it 's kind of a , it 's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries , and , um , it was called People to People , and we 'd stay in people 's homes , and then we got to also tour big cities , and I really enjoyed it . Was that in high school -- Uh-huh -- -- or was that a college thing ?

So I 'd like to go back , because we had , you know , everything was rushed -- I bet . -- everything was like an hour or two hours at the Louvre , you know , things like that where you need the whole day , but -- Right . -- but it really , That 's where a camcorder would come in handy . Exactly , that 's true . Well that sounds real neat . So you , you have n't been back to Europe since then , huh ? No , I always thought I would , but who knows now .
