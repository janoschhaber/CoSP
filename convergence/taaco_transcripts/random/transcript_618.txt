I do n't know what you drive now . I mean , what do you drive now ? Uh , I have a Ford pickup and , uh , the family car is a , uh , a Dodge Caravan . Oh , okay . And , uh , because we have three kids and they 're under thirteen so , uh -- Throw them in the back . -- they sort of fit our requirement . Yeah , 

I have a , one of those , uh , pickups with the , uh , seat -- Cab . -- with a seat in the back . Oh , yeah ? And so they just fit in there . When they get to be teenagers with long legs , it may not work . Yeah . Right now , I can , right now , I can throw them all in the back when we have room and , uh -- There you go . -- and since I do a lot of projects , I throw things in the back and I kind of like having a pickup truck . Yeah , yo- , Actually , I think of it as a , as a car that 'll last . Right , yeah , I know . I like the way trucks are built and I do n't care about comfort . So , I 'm pretty happy . Yeah , you 're looking at , I got a Toyota Four Runner . I wanted a truck that I , I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too , so I got a Four Runner . So I would n't hesitate to get another one . I , I never buy new so I would n't hesitate to get another used truck . You 're just like me . I 've never bought a new vehicle in my life . And , uh , yeah , I do n't , I do n't need to pay for the glitz . I 'll -- No . -- let somebody else , uh , have the showroom shine 

MUMBLEx and I 'll pay for the rest of it . Let somebody else break it in , right . 

Right . And , uh , the van we 're sor- , we might go again on a , on a van . We , we could probably do with a , a , something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time . I 'm not sure . 

Yeah . We have to , we , we 'll have to face it in a couple of years but , uh , I , I guess , we had a small Toyota wagon -- Right . -- and we were real happy with that because , uh , my , my second requirement after price is , uh , low maintenance . Right . And , uh , th- , it certainly had that . We did n't do much to it at all . Yeah . So . Yeah , my , my , MUMBLEx pretty much the same . I , I got a , like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , it pretty much does everything I need it to . I mean , it , it 'll tow three thousand pounds so I can tow everything and it , I can throw , I 've had eleven people in it before . 

Uh-huh . Believe it or not . And , uh , it 's real reliable , belie , I , I mean I 've had it for almost four years now and up until , oh , say two weeks ago , it had never had anything wrong with it . Uh-huh . And then , of course , two weeks ago , it decided , I do n't know , it 's the strangest , weirdest thing in the world , but it blew a head gasket . Uh-oh . Did n't do any damage to it . Uh , I caught -- How , at how -- -- it real early . -- at how many miles ? Uh , oh ninety-seven -- Huh . -- thousand . So it 's not real early . You did n't overheat it ? No . Never overheated it . I smell , I smelled the , uh , I smelled the coolant . Uh-huh . Went out and looked . Saw it was , saw where it was coming from . Drove it right to the shop and left it off . Huh . Well that was , MUMBLEx , And that was it because I , d- , I have that and then I have a , a Kawasaki motorcycle . Uh-huh . Which is , actually , the , usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it 's not raining . Yeah . I mean that 's , that 's sort of my , hobby though more than a vehicle . 

It , it 's a , I do n't know , people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves . I have one colleague that , uh , commutes to work on one when it 's not raining and , uh , uh , he 's a , it 's , he 's pretty conservative guy . I do n't think it 's much of a sport for him . I guess , uh , I know but I bet you he really enjoys riding it . I 'm sure he does , yeah . Yeah . So , you know , yo- , h- , when was the last time you took out , took your truck out just to , just to go driving ? Yeah . No . And I go out twice a week on the bike , so . Yeah . At least . Just for -- Uh . -- the enjoyment . Yeah . 

But , yeah , I , I mean , the only thing I think I might get , a new car or , not necessarily a new car but , a , another car , uh , I would consider going to a , a non , to a normal pickup rather than a , a covered pickup like the one I 've got . Just because there 's a lot of times I wished I had , ju- , just an open bed to throw stuff in . Right . I 'm sure , I 'm sure that that 's very , I mean you got one . It 's , that 's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back and , If I only had some place that I could store the , uh , camper top , I would have it off most of the time . Right . I really leave it on there just for , just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty . To have it out of the way . Right . But , uh , they 're solid . Uh , trucks are built , uh , I mean , I think they last a lot longer than anything else . They 're the only things Americans still know how to build and , uh . Yeah , yeah , the trucks do . Uh , even though , you know , the Jap , the little Jap trucks are , are good there too . But so are the , though I think the Chevies , I do n't think the Che- , I do n't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords . Yeah . I think they , I think the Fords tend to last a little longer . Right . 

I -- At least until recently . -- I kind of like mine , yeah , so , mine 's a Ford . A friend of mine just bought MUMBLEx , bought like a year ago . It , it 's a really nice truck . I mean , I do n't like Dodges at all but one of the Dodges they have out now has a , uh , the Cummins turbo diesel on it . Oh , I heard about that , yes . Oh , it 's beautiful . Yeah . That thing , that thing will last forever I mean , That , that 's a serious truck . Oh , yeah , that thing 's , uh , it 's got a boat engine in it . Right , this , uh , I , I know a contractor who just got one of those . Uh-huh . He 's pleased with it .
