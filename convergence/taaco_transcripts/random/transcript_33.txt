Okay , Mary . Yes . Um , the , uh , the latest one I 've seen , uh , had to do with a , uh , uh , the , uh , basically a manhunt , um , and it was , uh , it was called MANHUNTER , actually . 

Uh , the , uh , the guy , uh , apparently had a , a , mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people . Uh , just , uh , kill them with , with as much blood and , and guts as possible . Oh , how awful . It was true , it was truly awful . It was not one that I picked , but , uh , uh , it , it did show some , some , uh , some interesting things about the F B I because they were the , the , uh , the characters trying , trying to get him were F B I people and , uh , uh , of the , of the few good things that were in it , it did show , uh , a lot about the F B I . About the training , and , and how they go through training and how they try to , to develop , uh , uh , a mental picture of who they 're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that . And it was , uh , uh , it was pretty telling about the , the , the F B I and their procedures . I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction . Yeah , I , I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I , uh , going , I guess . Yeah , well , they keep it rather secretive , yes . Yeah , yeah . Well the most recent movie I saw , uh , I 'm afraid was , uh , well two , two of them actually . Uh , the RAIN MAN was one . Oh that was great one . Was n't that fabulous , 

and , Oh , I loved it . and DRIVING MISS DAISY . You know , I have n't seen that one yet , and I need to go see it . Oh , you need to see that . Yeah . That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people . Uh-huh . Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black and this all took place in the South . Oh my . And , uh , normally never the twain shall meet . 

You bet , especially in the South . Yes , right , and , um , uh , it , it really was a fantastic movie . The acting was phenomenal . Well as , it , as I recall it got some Academy Awards , did n't it . Oh yes , Jessica Tandy won best actress and , uh , Oh yeah , that 's right . It , it might have one best picture , too . Yes it did , yes it did . Yeah . Just as RAIN MAN , uh , with Dustin Hoffman , That was , uh , that , that was tremendous and Tom Cruise . yeah , I , I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of , uh , of how to act from Dustin Hoffman , but , uh . Yes , uh , oh , that was , that was , uh , what the , much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman . Yeah , it must have been great just being with him on , on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his , for his lines and all that stuff . Yeah and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati . Oh . Which is just forty-five miles from , from where I am , where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton . Is , is the Kmart there ? . Oh , we do have Kmart here , you better believe it . Is n't there a Kmart everywhere ? That was , that was so funny , he had to , or was it Kmart . Yes . He had to buy his underwear at Kmart . 

Right , right yeah . That was hilarious . The , the , I guess the , the first , the first , uh , scene in that movie that really got my attention , uh , concerning the , the disease and all that was when he , uh , dropped the , the , uh , the toothpicks , Oh yes . and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image . Yes , 

yes . Unbelievable . Well , you know there are people , uh , referred to as savants also , Yeah . uh , who can do most phenomenal things and everyone feels they are totally retarded . Yeah , wel- , because that 's the way they , they might seem outwardly , That 's right . but , boy there 's a lots going on in there . It 's amazing . Yeah , yeah and I , the , the , I think the , the best thing about RAINMAN was the , uh , the way that they put together the , the real awfulness of the , of the , of the disease , Yes . only , an , and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it , you know , and , and , and you need to , to work with it , uh , you know , certainly on , on a daily basis but then ag- , then again work with it toward a good end . Yes and the , Not , not toward winning in Las Vegas , for example . Right , well the warmth that developed between them and again it , I think was a picture of relationships . Yeah . Again the relationship , uh , between the two , uh , that , uh , never would have occurred , uh , by accident . 

Right , right . I was , uh , I was so impressed with that movie I saw it three times . Did you . I can , I can se- , tell you , oh , so much about that movie , just because it , it really rang , uh , rang a lot of my , uh , my personal background . I , I have a , a brother myself that 's , that 's older and , uh , he 's not , you know , nothing , nothing , of course , serious is wrong with him but , uh , but we have gone through these , these lapses of , of a relationship , Yes . somewhat , sometimes , and then , you know , uh , for , for , for no real , you know , direct reason , I guess , uh , we , we get into , uh , uh , a really good relationship for a while and then , you know , back and forth so I , I was really able to , to relate to the , the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers . That was neat . Uh-huh . Well that 's tremendous , that , it 's good because it does make you think , about your own family . Yeah , a lot . And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother . Uh-huh . No question , he , the , he was , he 's one of these guys though that does n't really like to go see movies like that . He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things . Uh-huh . And , and , uh , it , it was like pulling teeth to go get him to , to see it but , uh , oh boy . He was , uh , uh , he , he gave the , the best response that I 've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN . I mean he certainly did n't , 

he only saw it one time , and he did n't go back for more , but , uh , he , he said he enjoyed it and , and , Well he at least saw it one time . Yeah , yeah , and , and he really , I do n't know , he , he 's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway . But he wa- , but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this . I 'm like , oh , come on . Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is . Yeah . He will do that , to research it and to be able to mimic a person , uh , uh , with the kinds of problems that he had . And to make it believable . Yes . I mean I was , I was believing it , I do n't know about any body else but I was , it was great . Well , I 'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them . He did great . Well it 's just , uh , been delightful talking with you . Yeah , yeah , you take care up there and , uh , let 's hear it for the summertime . Absolutely , I 'm ready for it , but they 're predicting some more snow for our direction . No , oh no . Oh well , take care . Take care now . Bye , bye . Bye , bye .
