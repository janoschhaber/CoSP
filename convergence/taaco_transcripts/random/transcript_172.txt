Okay . Do you go camping very much ? No , I 've have n't gone camping in years . But it 's is something that I 've done in the past . How about you ? Uh , we try to go once , maybe twice a summer . Uh , That 's , that 's pretty average to me . we , uh , just , you know , for like a short weekend or something . 

We do n't go for the long , you know , week long thing . Uh-huh . But we usually go to , uh , a lake area , you know , where the campsites , Right . are and do that . Uh , Do you tent camp or do you have a camper ? Oh no , no , no a tent . That 's what I ha , you know , that 's how I camp too . That 's how I define camping . Me too . You 're really roughing it . The rest , the rest of that is re- , really not the same . Yeah . As a matter of fact , my , my , you know , the majority of the amount of camping I 've done has been really roughing it . Um , as a little girl I 'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother , and we went to the Boundary Waters area in Minnesota . So , Oh . that 's , that 's really wild . Yeah . Are you here in local Texas , I mean ? Yes , I 'm in Austin , where are you ? I 'm in Garland . 

Oh . Right outside of Dallas . Uh-huh . So we , um , we have a five year old , and we started taking her , she was pretty young when we started , uh , camping with her . Oh , the kids love it . I know . I mean , they just love it . It 's wonderful for them to be outside . I know , and then they , and they , you know , there 's no T V , and they do n't have all these modern toys , and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like , Exactly . that to play with . Yes . And I like that . It 's pretty fun . Well , how it , it 's really is a , is a good , good family thing , Uh-huh . to do . Yeah . Yeah . And , We , we try to , uh , go with another couple that have children also . Uh-huh . And , uh , that makes it a lot more enjoyable . Plus , you know , we do n't have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff , you know , we kind of split it up . Uh , Good planning . Yeah . Because it gets , it really does get expensive if you , if you do n't want to rough it all the way . Exactly . You know , even the sleeping bags , those are running , you know , a good thirty dollars a pop , and , You 're right . and so we 've built that up . But , Do you have a boat ? No . No ? Want one bad . Do you ? Oh , well , actually , I would , you know what I would love ? I would absolutely love a sail boat . Oh . That does n't go along with camping , but , Yes . now that , that , that 's what I would like , Yeah , to have . I would too . Yeah . Would too . We usually , uh , let 's see , we try to go to a lake . My husband and this , uh , other couple that we go with , her husband , um , kind of likes , um , is it scuba dive ? And , so we 'll go to a lake and , uh , where they can go do that . Uh-huh . We 're close enough so they can do that , and the girls can play on the beach area . And I would play on the beach area too . Yeah . That 's what I would do . Yeah . Yeah . That 's fun . I 'm just sitting here list , listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that . Really ? Am I pretty Texan ? You 're pretty Texan . Yes . But you know , you know what 's really funny ? Um , I 've had people tell me that I have a Texas accent , and , and I mean , there is just no way I 've not picked one up . No , you do n't , you do n't sound like it to me . I 've only lived here about six years . Oh , have you ? So , i- , i- , if I have one , it must be very , very slight . Yeah . The Yankees can hear it . Yes . Oh , that 's true , that 's true . I , see I do n't think I do , but , uh , but a lot of people do say I sound like , I guess , I have , I guess more of a twang , Uh-huh . to my voice . Are you a , a native Texan ? I sure am . Oh . I 've lived here all my life . Well , good for you . But , any way , uh , , Have you ever been to Austin ? Yes , yes 

we went last summer , actually . This , how was , I 'm wondering , I 'm really not that not familiar . I know there are some good places to go camping along the , uh , the lakes . Or is there ? 

Okay , well , we did n't go camping , we just , uh , we did like , uh , we drove down to Houston to visit friends , 

and , Uh-huh . we went to Galveston and , uh , to San Antonio and then up to Austin . And , and kind of , uh , you know , doing the sight seeing type stuff . So we did n't go camping . That would be fun though to go . That 's one thing my husband wanted to do , was , on this summer 's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went . And I said , Well , I 'd love that but , It takes a lot more planning . It does , and , and ever once , you know , on my summer vacation , you know , my week-long vacation , I , Uh-huh . want to be a little bit pampered , you know , by a , Right . hotel and a waiter . Exactly , exactly , yeah . So , we 're hoping to do like a three day weekend . There 's , um , a thing called Pfeiffer Rim . I do n't know if you have ever heard of it ? No , I have n't . It 's , uh , there 's a town called Glenrose . I think it 's around two hours from here . And , uh , it 's , it has like dinosaur tracks , Oh , that sounds , and stuff like that and it 's got one of those wildlife parks . That sounds great . Yeah . I think that 'll be fun . So we 're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend , go there and , Have you ever camped out of state ? No , I have n't . 

You know , where you should try , Where at ? sometime is Colorado . It is beautiful . Is it ? Absolutely beautiful . I 've just been up there skiing , and , well , we 've driven through , and , Uh-huh . you know , Uh-huh . but , but not , you know , camping or anything . But I would love to camp , Yes . in the mountains . Estes State Park is fantastic . That 's what my girlfriend says . Yes , she loves that place . See , you need to go there . She loves that . She says that where we need to go sometime . It is . It 's , you know , it 's , it 's high canyon and , uh , and there 's this little mountain lakes and it 's very peaceful . Oh . And , um , in , in the early fall time , Uh-huh . um , I ca n't remember what type of trees they are , but they , all the leaves turn yellow , Oh . and it 's just brilliant . And , I love that . Yes , you would . You 'd like it very much . That 's neat . That 's neat . I know you would . I used to go camping all the time as a , a Girl Scout . 

I was too . All the time . I got real used to it then . Yeah . I felt like we roughed it then . 

Uh , well we did , you know , we really did . I mean , I just do n't understand these people that think taking an R V , Right . and parking it and sitting inside and watching T V , Yes . and having your microwave , Exactly . It 's not camping . I mean , we had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything . Right , right . I mean that is it . You have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff , Right . to really be camping . Oh . Yeah . Well do you , you , you say you have n't been in years ? No , I have n't . I 'm , um , I 'm a struggling single mom . Oh , gosh , bless your heart . and , uh , thank you . Um , it 's , you know , time is precious , money 's precious . Yes . 

Um , and i- , i- , it , it , I think I have n't been able to do it , and , you know , what , that was one of the things I really thought I 'd like to do with my children , Uh-huh , uh-huh . you know , again . And th- , I 'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women . I do n't blame you . You know ? I do n't blame you at all . I hope , Years ago it would have been fine but , Yes , I , I really now , n- , n- , 

I , I have gone on one little vacation , just the girls and I . We drove down to Port Aransas , 

Oh . and rented a little efficiency , you know , Yeah . and , and had a marvelous like two nights , Yeah . and that was great . And even at that , it , it was like the first time that I ventured , Uh-huh . you know , out of the city by myself . And , and , you know , I , I stayed in a nice place . But it 's still , it 's real different not to have another adult with you . Yes . I kn , You know . I can imagine . I 'm just a chicken . I know lots of women would do it all the time . No . I do n't blame you , not nowadays . I have n't quite adjusted , you know ? Yeah . Now are you with T I down there ? Well , I , I was with T I until January . I , uh , I left T I in January hoping to strike out and find a job where I could make some money . Good . So , well it 's , Have you ? . It was a good plan but I have n't yet . Okay . I got into sales , and , Oh . I 'm selling , uh , telephone systems . Oh , that 's neat . And it 's , it 's fun and it 's interesting , but it 's also , um , pretty challenging , and I have n't , I have n't started making money yet . Um . It 's hard is n't it ? So , yeah , it 's , it 's hard . 

Now , how old are your girls ? Eleven and fourteen . 

Oh , goodness . Yeah . 

So I 'm old . No , you 're not old . You 're not old at all . Well , excuse me just second . Sure . Honey , I 'll be wi- , yeah ,

That 's very smart . Yeah so , well , I 've enjoyed this . Yeah , me too . And , uh , And good luck . How many have you made so far , calls ? I , I have n't made any . I 've been just a recipient . Oh , have you ? 

They 're all , this is only about my second one I 've ever made . I 've been a recipient on the others . How many have you had so far , do you know ? I think I 've had about four . Four , that 's good . Ye- , yeah . Very good . That 's four each . Well , you know , when I had to sup- , this is my , my Gemini nature , you know , it 's like what are you interested in , Yes . and it 's like virtually anything . I 'll talk about anything to anybody . Yeah . I do n't , yeah , you bet , you bet . And it 's , it 's been real interesting , the different personalities . I know . That I run across . Yes , I always try to find out where they 're from , Exactly . you know , cause , because it is neat . Uh-huh . It really is . Uh-huh . 

Well then , I guess I 'll let you go so you can go get the door and , Well , thank you . And , um , I enjoyed talking with you . You , me too . You have a good time camping , when you go next time , Thanks . think of me . Okay . Thank you . All right . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
