about the weather . Oh , yes , very appropriate , I guess . Uh , you ready for this ? Yeah . Okay , John , just a moment . Well , guess what , we get to talk about the weather . The weather is , uh , this time of year has actually been kind of unusual . 

I have n't expected it to be colder until , you know like we 've gotten the last couple of days . Uh-huh . I do n't know . I fly for a living , and I 've , uh , the weather 's been terribly unusual every where I 've been . Oh , you do -- Yeah . -- so you , you , you probably go everywhere -- Yeah . -- and have all sorts of weather . I imagine it 's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather . Well , it was around here last night , I 'll tell you that . Well , actually I 'm , I 'm , I 've heard on the news that we , uh , will be setting a record here in the State of Texas for the , uh , large amounts of rain and moisture we 've had this year , that it 's going to break all kind of records that were set , set , set back since nineteen thirty-two . No kidding . So , yeah . Um . If it keeps on raining like this , and I understand it 's supposed to rain until Saturday night . Saturday or Sunday they were saying , yeah . Oh , yes . Yeah , I know the systems have been real strong out . I went through , uh , Phoenix on , twice on , uh , Wednesday morning -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , MUMBLEx approaches to low minimum MUMBLEx both , both times -- Wow . -- and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather so , And so are you an airline pilot ? Yes , I am -- Oh , great . -- for Southwest , yeah . For Southwest , fantastic . I have a brother , I have a brother that 's a pilot , also , with American . Oh , is that right ? Yeah . So I imagine you , uh , oh , with all this kind of weather it , uh , makes it kind of dangerous for you . Well , now , I would n't call it danger . This is , uh , this really is n't bad stuff to fly around in . This is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the Springtime . Oh , I guess so , yeah . Yeah , the , the air systems are reasonably calm . We do n't have , uh , the turbulence -- Uh-huh . -- have a , uh , little bit of chop , but it 's not like it is in the spring time . Oh , yes . Well , we moved actually down here from another location , and it 's spectacular the , the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time , the torrents of rain . Spectacular is the right word for them . Pardon me ? Spectacular is a good word for them . I 've never seen a thunder show like I 've seen down here before in Texas . It 's amazing . Lights up the whole sky and even on a , on a , 

actually I 've , I 've seen it where there 's not a cloud in the sky , it 's a cloudless night , and the rain is n't falling , but you can see the thunder , and , excuse me , see the lightening going horizontally across the sky -- Oh , yeah , yeah . -- and back and forth , and what a light show . Yeah -- It 's , it 's fabulous . -- cloud to cloud it can be real , really sensational here . Yeah , that 's true . Where are you from originally ? I 'm from , uh , northern Utah , and that 's a very arid climate , from , uh , Salt Lake City area -- Uh-huh . -- and there 's always a lot of snow . In fact , where I grew up we were about an hour 's drive from seven to , uh , twelve different major ski resorts , and so -- Oh . -- there was an awful lot of snow , and because it was an arid climate , the snow was always a crisp , powder , light snow -- Oh , yeah . -- which made it fantastic for skiing and , and sleigh riding and everything else . Oh , yeah . So , we had a great time . Were you near , near the Park Cities area . Um , yeah , in , uh -- Beautiful area . -- in Snowbird and Solitude and -- Uh-huh . -- and Brighton and yes ,  all those areas . So I imagine , have you skied before ? Well , we 've skied , I have not skied that area . Uh-huh . I 've driven through it several times . Uh , I skied , we skied California a bunch when we lived out there , and -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , um , and , of course , grew , we grew up in Minnesota , and we do some skiing there -- Oh , yeah , MUMBLEx . -- lot of cross country skiing there . Yeah , great . Well , do you think this , the , the weather is typical for this time of the year ? Well , not really ,  I , you know , Minnesota 's gotten just hammered with snow , um , the , um , uh , we 've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already -- Yes . -- I think -- Yeah . -- and , uh , I 've been surprised that we have n't seen more of the temperatures that we 've got today , you know , that moved in last night . Yeah , it 's been , it 's been cold . 

There was a time , though , in the , uh , middle part of November that got really cool , really , really -- Yes . -- unseasonably cool -- Yes , it did . -- and then it warmed right back up , and I thought , great -- Yeah . -- and that 's , that 's a fun th- , yeah , my wife was just listening here and she said , yeah , it froze in fact . Yeah , 

it was , it was real cold . Yeah , 

but that was very unseasonable for us down here . And , uh , but , uh , I 've really enjoyed the weather down here , too , because , uh , two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weat- , weather , and it 's not as severe , I should say -- Yeah . 

-- as the weather that I 've experienced up in northern Utah . Oh , yeah , 

that 's , that 's real true . Same with us from Minnesota . It 's , it 's , uh , in fact , I 've , I 've played golf on , on , uh , New Year 's Day one year . Down here ? Yeah , yeah . Not in Minnesota . No no , no no . I have a brother-in-law that lives in Minnesota and they say , boy , six months out of the year it 's bitter cold , and -- Oh , it is , it is . -- and the wind and the blowing snow and everything . Well , and they 've had , uh , you know , usually in Minnesota they get their snow in January -- Uh-huh . -- and February , and they 're up over sixty-five or sixty- ,
