Okay . Well , First of all , I want to tell you I have two little kids , but they 're not in public school yet . I , I get , I get that experience starting next fall -- Ah . -- with kindergarten . Yeah . Yeah . So you have n't really , uh , dealt with that in a sense . No . But , uh , being one of these late in life mothers , I 've listened to everybody else 's , you know , complaints as to wha , what 's the matter with either their kids or the school system . Yeah . So -- Yeah . -- I 've been surprised . Do , are , do you have school age kids ? Uh , mine are both out of school . Oh . And , uh , you know , I , I 've , in hindsight , seen some things that I wished that , you know , I had done something about that was , you know , within my power or , uh , you know , wish that in some ways we , as parents , had more control over -- Such as ? -- what 's happening up there , you know , type thing . Uh , well , just over the years there were situations that , uh , uh , came up that I did n't think were fair or handled correctly or the teachers did n't seem to be teaching anything . Of course , it 's a little hard to tell from the information that you get from your child , you know . Uh-huh . They , they bring things home and I was never one to believe everything my kids said , 

you know , about something . But , uh , still I , I questioned the ability of some of the teachers to , uh , really do a bang-up job , and yet others I know are just wonderful . Well , I heard a , a frightening thing . Actually , I did n't hear it . It was told to me or suggested to me , uh , that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of Texas , and I think it 's similar in , in many other states , if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage -- Huh . -- of , uh , people to teach math and sciences . And somebody said , well , you know , you could go in and , and substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day and there 's always going to be , you know , somebody having a need for a math or science teacher . I thought , Christ , they 're letting me in , -- Yeah . -- to , you know , this would be , this would be frightening . I do n't know anything about it . That 's pretty interesting because just , just because you know a subject matter -- Right . 

-- does n't mean you can teach it . Right . And even if I knew how to teach the subject matter , I do n't know if I 'd know how to handle that kind of a , a group of kids . Oh , yeah . In fact , I think that 's , that 's one of the big problems today is the , the way the kids behave or act and , and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what 's going on in the class and disruptive . I tell you what I 'm finding frightening and this comes from , you know , the , the aging hippie near forty mother . So I went through this period of supposedly , you know , cosmic social enlightenment . I 'm on , I 'm in the Plano school system and living in Richardson , and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school . Uh-huh . And I used to think , well , that 's wonderful . You know , they can get a real life experience . What I 'm seeing now , uh , in terms of kindergarten preparedness , just from , in , in , in different preschools -- Uh-huh . -- it 's like day and night . And I wonder , how do they handle a child who is obviously very ready and another child who does n't even speak English , let alone know her colors . Yeah . And they 're in the same classrooms . And I guess also you 're going to see the first of the , uh , crack kids starting kindergarten . My God , I think it would be next year is what I 'd read . I thought , well , how do you , how do you weed those out ? Yes . Some of those certainly have a lot of dis- , difficulties , you know , with , uh , all sorts of things , and I would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases . When I was listening to N P R , the National Public Radio , 

and they 've quoted statistics that I just about , my throat just about fell into my toes . They said at the bottom of the S A T scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education . Oh , wow . Yes . That 's encouraging . Yes . And I , and I , I got to thinking back when I was teaching college chemistry , the people that took , you know , the lower level courses , I sometimes wondered , you know , are they really even educatable or trainable and it , my God , you know , i- , are the rest of us who went for the big bucks , you know , staying out of , you know , where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with -- Yeah . -- these kids ? I do n't know . Well , that 's , you know , that 's an idea . Maybe there need to be some radical changes made . Do some things that are totally different and unheard of . Well , you know , you , you sit here and you think about that . At the same time you think , God , I hope I do n't sound like a stage mother because , right now if you ask my friends t- , put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children , you 're going to have twenty hands , you know , up there . Oh , you 're kidding . Oh , no . Nobody has , nobody has a nongifted child . And I keep thinking , you know , gifted is , is Einstein or , you know , uh , musical prodigies . It 's , it 's not a kid who 's , you know , precocious . Yeah . You know , what has , you know , has , has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who 's above average is now gifted ? Huh . I do n't know . That 's interesting . I do n't know . Mine did n't , did not fall into the gifted category . Oh , do n't say that . Nope . And I would never had said so either . Uh , but , uh , they managed to get through , although not always with flying colors . Uh , in fact , one of the incidents I was thinking of that my son had . Uh , he was struggling with senior English and I had a meeting with the , uh , vice principal and the English instructor , and , uh , she showed me a paper that he had just handed in . And she told me what she had requested . And I read it and while it had , you know , a few little grammatical problems , it was n't very long and so forth . I thought it had some nice , well thought out , uh , parts to it . Uh-huh . She gave him an F on that paper . And I thought , well now , here you have a student who is trying to pass , who is struggling with your subject and you give them an F on something that does n't seem that bad to me . What are you telling that student ? You 're telling them that , hey , you might as well forget it , you know . Well , you see , I think that , that harks right back to the elementary and junior high years . Because I have a stepson now who 's twenty-five and , uh , I was just absolutely shocked , uh , the first time that I saw his schoolwork . Uh , I remember being , you know , taught , and I think , you know , you have to teach how to write an answer and , you know , how to construct a thought process . Uh-huh . And , you know , they can get a , they can grasp the points . Can they convey the data verbally or in writing . And that 's what 's , you know , really scary to me . Uh , I would really , you know , there 's such a , a push among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate . I would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought and at an early age . And if they ca n't , I mean if they have missed that training , then somebody , you know , before you 're , you 're start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they 're thinking , teach them these basic skills . 

Yeah . It 's pretty sad to think , uh , about those who , even today , are graduating from school and they are telling that they do n't know how to read , you know . Well , my stepson , you know , I , he went into the Navy or Air Force . I just really get my military , I married into a military family , and I do n't know , I re- , address them all as generals so I do n't offend anybody . But , uh , you know , fortunately for him , he was n't dumb but boy he sure had trouble , you know , putting things on , on paper . Yeah . And one of the things that , that they did for him . They tested him and they said that he 's , you know , great in electronics but he , you know , he 's , really does need the basic skills . And they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training . And at that point , he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors . Oh . This is the kid who , who really , you know , barely -- Yeah . -- made it through high school . And I keep thinking , you know , it 's not , it 's really not too late at any point to do , you know , some- , That 's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it . 

Yes . You would have expected them to be the last ones to . Yes . And I kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations . 

But I think that for this kid , it 's going to be , you know , his lifesaver . Otherwise , he might have been driving trucks or framing houses , you know , from here to eternity . Yeah . So , I do n't know . You know , it does make me nervous . Well , I can see why if you 've got little ones just coming along . There 's a , a whole lot of stuff going on out there . There is a whole lot of stuff going on out there and , and part of me says I just would like to , you know , shut my eyes and pretend it does n't , you know , go on . Or send them to private schools . And then the , you know , the old social conscience says , you know , I 'm not working , I do n't need to work . Maybe I should volunteer to , you know , teach what I know . Yeah . Maybe adult literacy . Maybe , you know , composition writing . Maybe , you know , uh , volunteering , you know , on a tutor line or though the , even through the elementary schools for help with homework or , the other part of me says , is God , I 've had enough kids . Do I reall- , .
