Um , what kind of hobbies do you have ? Um , I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting , when I do have spare time . Really , I like cross-stitch too . Oh , I love it . I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately . That 's my case also . I 've got a new born 

and there 's just no time . Uh-huh . Have you been cross-stitching long ? Oh , several years . My husband is even interested in it now . He likes to help me design , um , you know , projects that are , Oh , really . a little more customized . Mine , sort of , he looks at the pattern and he says how do you get that from there to the material . Not that hard . Oh , it 's not . I really enjoy it . Uh-huh . I do a lot of my own patterns also . Yeah . 

In fact , I did one , BILL THE CAT , you know , from Glenn County -- Oh , yeah . -- that , uh , was a real good one to do . 

It was tough , but , uh , yeah . Do you have any others , or is this mainly cross-stitching ? Um , I do mostly that , um , not very artistic really for like painting and stuff . Oh , uh-huh . Um , But , now I do n't know . Yeah . I 'm still trying to get all the D M C colors . Oh , really . Yeah , I 've got the kits to put them all in . I do n't have them all yet -- Yeah , right . Yeah . -- certainly . Yeah . I got to counting the other day and , uh , I think I have , what was it two hundred , and I got to thinking the money that I 've got invested in this is , uh , it , yeah , it can add up quick . Oh , yeah . I just , I just keep an inventory of what I currently have , and then when I start a new project , I go through and see if I , if I , you know , just buy the colors that I need -- Uh-huh . -- of what I 'm low on . Right . I see . Well , now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead , you know , what comes close . Uh-huh . Because a lot of them are similar . Yeah . A lot of times you can do that . I think , I the pinks , there 's like forty-two different shades of pink . Good grief . Yeah , there 's lots of pinks and greens . 

Pinks and greens . Yeah . There 's lots of shades of greens . But the colors , I just love all the different colors . Yeah . They had quite a few new ones come out last year , that they added to . But , you do n't have much spare time either ? Well , not lately . I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there . Oh , yes . And that does take some time . And if we 're trying to get acclimated with the , uh , with having a baby , and MUMBLEx . Yeah . How old ? He 's seven months old . Oh , yeah . And just into everything , so there 's not a spare moment . Oh , but I would n't trade it for the world . I 've been trying to do some bibs for him . Oh , yeah . 

And , uh , work on his Christmas stocking . Yeah . We missed it last year , so hopefully this year he 'll have one . Yeah . Well , last year he was a little bit young for having one . 

Right . He would n't have enjoyed it anyway . . MUMBLEx . You would have but , Right . If it tasted good , yeah . All he liked was the lights this year , so . Oh , yeah . Oh , well , that 's neat that you like cross-stitching also . Yeah , that 's , that 's kind of strange that we got the same call . Yeah . It 's a MUMBLEx call . Oh , I 'm sorry . Go ahead . No , that 's okay . Okay , uh , but , yeah , I 've been doing it for probably ten years or so . Oh , wow . No , I just started about , well , five years ago , I think . But it is peaceful , I mean it is relaxing to do , once you find the time to do it . Uh-huh . There 's also a couple of large projects , baby afghans , and I got one done and I think the other one is going . The child is going to be in high school before I get finished . On that , uh -- Bear thing . -- is it one of those afghans that I 've seen in the packages with the , with the large squares ? Well , yeah I just , I bought the cloth and the pattern for it . 

I did n't , um , I did n't buy the , uh , I did n't buy a kit . Oh , uh-huh . Well I 've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching . Uh-huh . It 's that cloth . Oh , okay . It 's an- , cloth I think . Uh-huh . And it has the borders and everything already . Yeah . Those are pretty . Number one turned out just great , and the lady said she could n't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors , that they had decorated the nursery and I did n't even know it . Oh , that 's a MUMBLEx . I gave it to her and she said how did you know those are the colors we used . I said did n't . That was a good MUMBLEx . It worked out that way . That 's great . Uh , that , uh , now I 've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it . Uh-huh . I like those . Those are pretty . Yeah . Lilly , Lilly , she said , she said it 's for your daughter to use . Oh , no . She said , I know she does n't get to touch it . She hung it on the wall . Yes , my , uh , grandmother , um , made us a couple of quilts for the baby , and I was like , oh , I do n't want to mess those up . 

Yeah . Uh , they 're just too nice . I mean you do n't get many hand made quilts anymore . Yeah . Oh , yeah . True . Well , I 've enjoyed this . Okay . But , uh , well keep up the good , um , keep up the cross-stitching . You too . All right , thanks . Uh-huh , bye bye . Bye bye .
