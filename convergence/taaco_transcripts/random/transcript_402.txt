Hello , my name is Donna , and I 'm calling from Plano , Texas . Hi , this is Laurie , and I 'm in Garland . Oh , okay . Um , would you like me to go first ? Sure . Okay , um I have three children , um , two , two who are in regular school , uh , eleven year old , an eight year old , and then my little one , three year old , is in , um , a University of Gymnastics , it 's a , a preschool -- Uh-huh . -- and , um , I think it was really hard to , um , to pick the right , uh , day care or preschool or Mother 's Day Out . I guess you can classify them all together . Uh-huh . Um , some of the qualifications that I look for was that , uh , you know , the cost , and , um , exactly what they did , if it was structured or nonstructured , if they had a little academic , um , uh , in there , and , um , you know , um , you know , what the qualifications of the teachers ' were , and if the place was clean and -- Uh-huh . -- um , the hours 

and , um , just , just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program -- Right . -- that kind of stuff . Well , we do n't have any children , but we 're going to have one next year . Oh , congratulations . Thanks . So , um , that 's something that I 'm probably going to be looking at -- Right . -- maybe in the future . We have n't quite decided if I 'm going to , I 'm working part time now , and I do n't know if I 'll be doing that or what we 're going to do . Or staying home . But if we do , then I 'm going to need to find somebody , and our church has a Mother 's Day Out program -- Uh-huh . -- which they started last year , and we know a lot of people at the church so I would feel very confident with leaving -- That 's a very good place to start I think . -- my child there . 

Uh-huh . Yeah , the Mother 's Day Out programs , and that 's where Shannon had started , in a Mother 's Day Out program -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , the churches always have I think , a , a pretty good program , and you have to make sure that you , um , that you apply pretty early , because they do have , a lot of places have very long waiting lists . Uh-huh . And , um , and another question to ask is if they 're , um , state certified -- Okay . -- um , you know , if the teachers have , um , their Master 's degree in , in child education and -- Uh-huh -- um , child development . Um , you know , what , what kind of a structure is it going to be . 

Um , when your child 's a little bit older , like a three year old -- Uh-huh . -- you 'd be more concerned with if there 's a type of care that it 's torture for them to lay down and take a nap . Is there like a mandatory nap time ? Time , uh-huh . What they do at Shannon 's school is have a video tape going , and if , and they lay on these little mats , and if they fall asleep , they kind of let them sleep , and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones , and the other ones get up and go do something else . Uh-huh . So , she does n't have to necessary take a nap there -- Right . -- you know , which is , which is nice . Um . Uh-huh . Um , you know , it 's kind of scary , I guess , because you hear so many bad things about day cares -- That 's true . -- lately , and so , it 's , I guess it 's such a growing concern , but then there 's a lot of good things you do n't hear . Right . And sometimes when the child 's a lot younger , before they 're really , um , before three years old , you know , like the church is a good program and sometimes you even consider , um , you know , having a private person come to your own home when they 're real little or -- Right . -- or something like that , and another consideration is how many infants or children are they , what 's the ratio of , of teachers to -- To children . -- to children -- Right . -- because that makes , a , a , a difference , and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day , just your child , and , or do they just put any child in any crib -- Uh-huh . -- you know , you would want , maybe , your child to have their own sheets all the time , and not have another -- Right . -- child use that bed -- Right . 

-- you know . I 'm sure that , um , whatever you decide , you 'll be happy with . Yeah . And it 's exciting time to have a new one . Yeah . 

We 're pretty excited . I bet . That 's , that 's wonderful . Yeah , but that , you know , we have been thinking about that , but it 's a little ways off in the future -- Uh-huh . -- but , um , I figure , you know , I 'd probably start asking -- Asking . -- around at church -- Right . -- because I know they have a limit as to how old they can be before they , you know , before you can bring them in . Some , some places , um , start them as early as , I think , well , some , some places take them as infants , I guess , you know , like eight weeks , even . Uh-huh . Um , there 's a place to look into , um , um , a friend of mine who 's a nurse is , was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place in , on Fifteenth Street , up , it 's in Plano somewhere where , um , nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants , infants and then only up to like two years old -- Um . -- and it 's , it 's supposed to be really a , a , you know , some places just specialize in just real little ones -- Right . -- and then other ones , uh , are the older children . Uh-huh . But it is a difficult situation , I think . When they 're , when they 're little it 's almost easier to leave them because when they 're three and they 're cry ,
