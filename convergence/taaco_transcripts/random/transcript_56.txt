Okay , um , now the term personal computer , uh , I do n't happen to have one at home . Um , but I do have a personal computer on my desk here . A type of work station ? Yeah , uh , yeah , just kind of , it 's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to , to , uh , shall we say bypass the formal procurement process . And , uh , it , it works just fine . It says it 's a monochrome monitor , Panasonic printer , uh , no big deal , it , it does the things I need for it to do . Is it a two eighty-six or three eighty-six base machine ? No , it 's not even that . It 's eighty eighty-eight ? Uh , I think that 's about where it is . Okay . Uh , what type of , uh , utilizations do you make of it ? Word processing obviously . Uh , yeah , I do that , I , I do , uh , some Lotus on it . Uh , do some , uh , Samna , some , uh , P F M , uh , nothing extremely complex . Okay . Uh , I use them both here at work and at home . Uh-huh . And I have I B M clones in both cases . 

Yep . Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty-six base mach- , machine . Oh , yeah . I bet that 's a pretty nice setup . Yes , it is . Uh , unfortunately I need all of it . Yep . Uh , for example , I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that 's a third of a meg in beta size . Wow . And that , I know that , uh , brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because , I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty-six machine , Yep . and it brought it to its knees . Wow . Just in the ability to handle . And then I have , uh , a three eighty-six F X a sixteen bit machine , Uh-huh . at home . And I 'm really pleased with it . Uh-huh . It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and , Sure . uh , databases , database searches . 

Uh-huh . Uh , what I 've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them . Have you , Yeah . Yeah . To try to make them more effective and useful . Right . Have you been , uh , struggling along those lines ? Well , um , I seem to always be in the , the next to the last generation of word processing software . 

When everyone was in Samna I was still in P F M , and now that I finally become proficient in Samna everybody 's going to WordPerfect . So , I can never quite stay current with that . Well , I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it . It 's , uh , I used it on , uh , some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it . It was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it . Uh-huh . The , at least the version I had tended to keep copies of that . Oh . Of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of , all of a sudden you got a disc full error . Huh . Not a fun thing to try to recover from . I can bel , Very frustrating . I can believe that . Uh , but again I 've been dealing with large files both data and , and otherwise . Uh , that was a engineering spec on B two . You come here with the B level of specs ? No , not really . I 'm not that up be on that sort of thing . 

Well , it 's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you 're trying to build . 

Oh , okay . Uh , to one level down from assistant description . Oh , okay . Okay . Oh , well , it sounds like you 're pretty much into computers . Well , I sure need them . Uh , there 's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to , to try to do my job without them . I can believe that . Well , it 's , it 's been interesting . Yes , uh , maybe you 'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things . I think that 's when you , you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have . When you start seeing what all they can do for you . Yeah , of course , needs and wants are n't necessarily the same thing . Well , I understand that , you know . MUMBLEx if , needs and wants were the same I 'd have a four eighty-six machine at home . I wo , is , is that the newest thing now , the four eighty-six ? Right . That , that must be a fairly recent release . Uh , that 's , came out around the first of the year . Okay , okay . Because I , I had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes , but I did n't know they had a four eighty-six just yet . It does a few more things , Uh-huh . uh , than had been available before . Yeah . But I 'm not sure that it 's such a massive improvement . Uh , you know , once you get passed thirty-three megahertz , all help is , kind of lost in the , in the translation . Sure . Because you no longer can think that fast anyway . Yeah . Well , okay . I enjoyed our discussion . I did too , and you have a good day . You do the same . Bye-bye . Bye .
