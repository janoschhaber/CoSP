Well , what do you know about Latin American policies ? Well , I think they 're kind of ambivalent , really . Uh , I just have a feeling that we 've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations -- Uh-huh . -- you know . Huh We , we do n't know , half the time we do n't know who to support . That , and , you know , maybe it 's , maybe it 's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with , with , uh , countries like that that depend on us so much -- Right . -- without , you know , just telling them , running their country for them but , That , that 's just it . It 's got to be tough , but , I mean , uh , uh , you sure , you still have to , you know , let them know how you feel . Right , I guess my concern , you know , no matter which , no matter which side we take , we 're going to have supporters and we 're going to have , uh , antisupporters , I guess , for lack of better term , and , uh , like you said , they 're such small countries , that we 're bound to upset somebody , but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance . Yeah , it worries me that , uh , the economy of so many countries in , in South America and Central America depend on something that damages people , like the , you know , like cocaine -- Right . -- from Columbia , and -- Right . -- uh , , you know , of course I , I 'm sure we have some enemies down there who would n't care what happened to us , but -- That 's true . -- but that is , that 's a tough deal , and it , I do n't think that , maybe I , maybe it 's , you know , I 'm reflecting how I feel about it , but I have a feeling that we , that we really do n't understand basically the , the , the competing factions in lot of those countries and -- Sure . -- I mean , they 've been hammering MUMBLEx , for the last , you know , ten centuries , and it 's still going on , and , uh , we , we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how , some times , Yep , that 's about the lump sum of it . Well , um , I was speaking with a , a woman from , I believe she was from the Honduras or Guatemala , or somewhere in there , no , she was from El Salvador -- Yeah . -- and , uh , she was from a relatively wealthy family , and when , uh , the Contras came into power , of course with , uh , oh , gosh darn , what 's his face , he 's in , in Florida jail now , Marcos -- Yeah , yeah . -- uh , no , 

he 's , Marcos is Philippines , Yeah , um , well , I 'm blank on it . Well , you know who I 'm talking about . I can see his face MUMBLEx forget his name . Yeah , I , I know it , uh , 

anyway , when he came into power , he basically just took everybody 's property , you know , just assigned it to himself . Yeah , kind of nationalized it -- Right -- -- for himself , -- right , and , uh , so she 's been a real strong supporter of the Sandinistas and has been trying to back the U S government in that respect , 

and in that respect I have to agree that I think we 're taking the right stance -- Yeah . -- uh , because they were a democracy turned , uh -- Dictator , -- yeah , right -- Yeah . -- basically a dictator fascist . And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing , it just -- Sure . 

-- you know , unstable . Well , what do you think of , uh , this , uh , U S free trade agreement we 're working on with Mexico ? Well , I think it 's long overdue -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I just , you know , there 's so much difference in , in the economies of the two countries , I 'm not , you know , I have a problem , uh , with whether it 's going to work or not , you know , there 's , uh , it seems like there 's , and I , this may be unfair to Mexico , but it seems like there 's a lack of honesty in , in foreign policy a lot of the times . Uh-huh , Mexico , they 're , I know they 're trying , they 're really trying , the Mexican government is trying , and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying to , oh , make themselves Americanized , I guess -- Yeah . -- and , uh , which is great because that 's what they basically need to do . The big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule -- Yeah -- -- you know , and -- -- yeah . -- we do n't have the Siesta , and there 's , the cultural differences is what 's , is what 's kind of , it 's what 's really hurting , uh , the Mexican people , because they 've had their way of life , and we 've had our way of life , and , uh , I think their , their version of the good old boy network going that , uh , you know , has a lot ,
