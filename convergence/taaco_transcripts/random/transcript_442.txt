I 'm sorry , um -- That 's okay , I did n't hear . -- hobbies . Okay . Let me see , I do n't know if that took or not , I 'll do it again . Okay . Okay . What are your hobbies ? I hear you have kids , right ? You heard her in the background . That 's babies . That 's your full time , uh , hobby , right ? Takes a lot of time , huh . I like , uh , most sports . I like to do that . I kind of like to do a little bit of sewing . 

Uh-huh . Oh , little bit of embroidery work , once in a while . Uh-huh . What do you like to do ? Um , I try to do some painting , although I 'm not very good at it . Well , I 'm sure you probably are . Well , no , not really . You like it , that 's the main MUMBLEx . Yeah , I , I have , you know , I inherited the genes that make me think I 'm creative , but not the ones that give me the ability to be . That 's right . So , I always try . I , I do some sewing , mostly out of necessity . Um , I 'm making drapes for my house , just because I 'm , Oh , boy , that 's hard sewing . Yeah , well , it is n't and it is . It is , you know , actually the sewing is n't the hard part , it 's just being able to lay out the material and measure it -- 

Measure it and get it to , -- because you need so much room . Well , if it , it depends on how elaborate you get it . If you get pleats and all kinds of , Yeah , I 've been doing that and , That 's a lot of work . 

That , yeah , that , but usually have to do the pleats by hand . So that , at least -- Oh . -- I can do , you know , watching T V or whatever but , Right , right . Yeah , and I 've , I 've gone and , you know , put the needle through my thumb a few times , trying to get it through but , That feels really good . Yeah , so that 's not really my favorite thing to do or anything , but I , I need to do it . To do it , right . I have , let 's see , I have a dog , and a lot of fish . Keeping fish , I guess -- Keeping fish MUMBLEx . -- is my biggest hobby . Well , they 're probably easier than keeping dogs , though , are n't they . Um , yes and no . It depends on how frequently they die , and -- Oh , no . -- how much that bothers you . How much that bothers you , and you probably have to clean out the tank too . That 's , you do n't have to do as much as , as I thought . In fact , my problem , I had fish as a kid and they always died -- Oh , no . -- immediately , and , what , I 'm , what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean -- 

Oh , you 're kidding -- 

-- because you have , -- because they need to have a little bit of the , Right , you need to let the bacteria build up , and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance . I see . And I would just take everything out and just like , you know , wash it with scalding hot water -- Oh , no . -- and it would kill all the bacteria , and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again -- And so you 'd have to -- -- so . -- start all over -- Right . -- to build that up probably . That 's right . So now only , I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing -- Right , 

right . -- and I do n't try and sterilize things . Do n't go through the whole nine yards and -- That 's right . -- they kind of need a little bit of that . That 's right . So you 've had fish for a long time . Well , I 've had them , I guess it 's been two years now I 've had a , a tank here , and then back at home I used to have a small , you know , five gallon tank . But that never worked well . What size do you have now ? I have fifty-five gallons now . Oh , that 's a good size . It 's a lot easier . Have you ever had it , uh , crack or break or leak . No . MUMBLEx . No , not yet . Fifty-five gallons , you 'd hope it would never do that . That 's right , I really do . But , you know . Do you have all kinds of different fish or , Yeah , I just have , you know , what they call community fish -- Uh-huh . -- guppies , and platies and , and basic things . I do n't get into the -- Real exotic . -- right , right . The expensive ones . Well , they 're probably hardy , harder to take care of and , They are . They 're very expensive and , you know , when you die , it 's like , when they die it 's more like an investment . Yes , I bet it is . You lost an investment 

so , Do you have problems with them , uh , the fish eating each other ? No , not really . Only if there 's baby fish . Right . You always have to isolate those . Then you have to , how do you isolate them ? You get a -- A jar or something or . -- well , no , they have breeders . Okay . It 's a little plastic things that sort of floats -- Okay . -- and you put the mother fish in there and then it 's got like a trough underneath her -- Okay . -- so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough and there 's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber -- Oh . 

-- so the mother ca n't get to them either . And that 's , you know , it kind of works , but it 's also got slots in it so the water can circulate -- Right . it 'll fit out the slots . It 'll go through the slot . That 's right , so . But , you know , it works , I guess . That works all right then . They do n't , uh , want the mothers to be with the little fish either . Oh , they 'll eat them . They will . Yeah . Is n't that odd . Yes . You would n't think that . It , and it 's funny because the one I have , every single month without fail she has babies . You 're kidding . Oh , no . All the time , and , um , I , and she 's supposed to , her variety , it says they wo n't eat the babies , and I 've seen her do it . So . And that just makes you sick almost , does n't it ? Oh , it 's ter , well , it makes you understand that , you know , things are different . Things are different in the animal kingdom , huh . We might , right . We might decide what 's proper and what is n't , but -- Yeah . -- you know , that 's the way it is for them . That 's kind of the way they do it . Yeah . That 's it . Survival of the fittest or something . Yes , because if the baby is strong enough , it can swim away fast enough -- Right . -- and go hide . Go hide from them , well -- So . -- and then , you think , well , how did they do it out in the real world anyway -- Yeah . -- when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are -- Yeah , yeah . -- kind of trying to keep up with that , but . If you 're like me , you never have enough time for the hobbies . No , not really . I , I try . I also , I play a couple of instruments .
