Okay . Wonderful touch tone telephone there . Uh , what kind of books do you enjoy reading ? Uh , have n't , have , I have a wide variety of , of hobbies , therefore , my , my reading pleasures are quite wide . Um , I get a charge out of , uh , TEXAS HIGHWAY , Oh . which is , uh , very colorful , and , uh , not being a native of Texas , but being here eleven years have a tendency to , uh , find out the , uh , about the different areas of the co- , of the , of the state by reading it . Right , I 've read that one too . I only had a subscription once , but my mother always gave me hers and I , I really enjoyed , you know , all the little things that you find out about Texas . Oh yeah , it 's , it 's , uh , absolutely , it 's great the way that it 's broken out and you can , uh , set up little trips and day trips and things . It 's pretty , pretty neat . Um , oh , I like photography , um , magazines . 

I do n't take a subscription or anything like that . Um , things , oh , being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of , a lot of , uh , building magazines and , and , and plant engineering magazines and , read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and , Uh-huh . and , uh , kind of strange because I , it 's not unusual to , uh , see , uh , an engineering manual or something laying around the house and then I 'll sit up and read just to refresh , uh , you know , to keep active on it , but , uh . Uh-huh . How about yourself ? Well , um , I have an interest in art , so I , frequently purchase and read , uh , books , mainly on water color because that 's my big interest at the moment . Oh , that 's great . And , uh , oh , I guess I like a variety of things , uh , lots of fiction , uh , type books . Uh , right now I 'm occasionally reading on a book about , uh , the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history . Uh-huh . That 's fairly interesting . I bet that would be , rather interesting . Uh , that 's , uh , self improvement , that 's , that 's alwa- , well , that 's kind of a hobby but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing , uh . Yeah , I do n't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement . How about you ? Um , well I hate to , yes , I do .  We , uh , we have these classes we attend , uh , management classes 

and , and they give you books and , and the last book , uh , matter of fact I read was , AT AMERICA 'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht . It talks about , uh , who the customer is and being customer oriented , uh , which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments . Yeah . Uh , one of its great slogans is if you 're not serving the customer , you better be serving someone who is . Uh-huh . 

Uh , so that 's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know , all of us are our own customer . You 're my customer , I 'm your customer , sort of thing . Right . Um , every now and then I 'm loaned a tape I can stick in the , uh , in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable , talking about , uh , better outlooks on things and the philosophy of , of Pat Hagerty and these kind of , uh , mind stimulating philosophy type . Yeah . Which all , you know , betters yourself . Yeah , yeah , well , uh , maybe I am into some things occasionally that I do n't think of in terms of self improvement . Uh-huh . I mean they are but I do n't label it as such . Like what for example . Well , I do n't know , um , I , uh , have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them , but , uh , I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things , but , uh , they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself . You know ge , getting your , yourself in gear to , uh , sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do . Sure . Convincing you that you need to get on with it . Sure . How about items like , um , THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER , which used to be a big , okay . Yes . So those are self improvements . Sure . Um , our supervisor , uh , subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW . Um . By a man , man named Doctor Bittel , B I T T E L and it 's a very layman 's , uh , uh , approach towards managing different types of people . And the very last chapter , and I have n't figured out why that one was last , is how to manage engineers .  So it 's , it 's ver- , it 's interesting , here again it 's , it 's casual reading and it 's not eaten up with a lot of , uh , mechanical stuff and it 's really excellent fast reading and , uh , but as you say it 's , it 's sometimes it 's difficult to , to know if it 's , you know , I think if somebody would say hey , read these ten books because these are self-improvements , I would probably be turned off to them . Yeah , yeah . If he casually just walked into it and , uh , put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested . I do n't know , I 'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King . That 's a little , little heavy for me . Yeah , they 're , uh , quite , uh , they 're hard to set down because it 's so interesting and , of course , they 're all just a little spookier than the movies , but , uh , Yeah . it 's always , they 're always challenging to get through one of them . I have a hard time finishing books . Well I guess I also have been reading , uh , a lot of things on , uh , quality improvement and that type of thing because that 's what I 'm involved in a lot at work . Uh-huh . In quality , especially now days , uh , that 's almost everything that comes across the , the , the airways MUMBLEx . Oh , yeah , you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other 

but , uh , Exactly , exactly right . I think sometimes the word is a little over used but , Yeah , we , we have , I think we , we name drop it a little too much and , and do n't fully understand what , what it is we 're saying . I think it 's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and , and all that kind of rolls in together there , Yeah . but , uh , that 's just kind of part of it . Okay , well , any other comments . Uh , not that I can think of . Um , I think I 'm under my quota a little bit . I need to probably make a phone call or two . Well we just started , 

right . Uh , this is true . I 've enjoyed it . Well you too , and uh , good-bye . Have a good day . Good-bye . Bye-bye .
