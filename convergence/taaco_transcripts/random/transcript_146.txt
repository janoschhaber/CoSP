Okay , well what do you think ? Well , I 'm kind of leaning towards , I do n't know , I 'm thinking about what , from one to ten what my no would be . It would probably be somewhere closer to , uh , less control because I do n't see , I 'm not a member of the N R A although my , father is . Uh-huh . But , I guess I believe , I think the N R A has gone overboard the wrong way . You know , Yeah . they 're sitting there on number ten , they 're saying absolutely no gun control , we do n't even want to think about it and , and I think that 's a dumb , Yeah . situation . 

Because there has got to be some kind of background check to see , that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose , you know , if , if you 're going to hunt with it , Uh-huh . or if you 're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week . Right . That 's true . It 's not a big deal for them to go . If they 're can check your driver 's license every time you get a ticket , you know , I mean , they should be able to go back and find out if you 've had any kind of psychiatric record , Right . armed , you know , felony record . That 's true . any of that kind of stuff . And , it seems to me right now that there 's not , there 's not that much of a check . I , I 'm not really sure what Texas law , I think there 's a check for MUMBLEx felonies , on your record . Right . But , If the gun shop owner does it , Uh-huh . you know , but , Yeah , but he has to go out and do it . That 's true , I think , Yeah , if , and if it 's a private sale , of course , then there 's nothing . Right . And , see that 's my only problem with , uh , making you , um , you know , get the check and everything is , is , I guess bad guys , if you want to call them bad guys , they are going to get a gun no matter what . Uh-huh . They 're not , I do n't think they 're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there 's a check , I think they 're going to go out and find it someway , individual sale or something like that . Yes . But , but maybe we 'll prevent a few John Hinckleys . Yeah . I hope . That 's true . You know , I , I , that , that 's the kind of people , like I say , I do n't think the guy who 's going to rob a Seven Eleven , is going to rob a Seven Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife , baseball bat , Knife , exactly . or , you know , whatever , He 's going to do what he wants to do . That 's true . I , I just think it makes honest people more honest and , Yeah . And , and the people who want it , it 's not that big a deal , like I say , to wait . Right . Right . And , if you have to have it in a hurry , something 's wrong . 

Yeah , it makes you wonder , 

 what they need it for all of a sudden here . Um , That 's right . That 's right . Oh . Well , I 'm married to a policeman , 

so we , we talk about this a lot . 

Yeah , I , I imagine his , his opinion is a little bit towards the one there , Yeah . on the -- Yeah . -- scale of one to ten he needs some more . Yeah . I was watching a , Gosh , if I was a cop I would be , worried about that . Too many people have too many , too much access . Yeah , they do . 

They do . and , I guess I think , the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is , there should be some law against the types of gu- , I mean , some of these Saturday night specials that these companies put out , Right . that are , pie- , I mean , they 're are basically it says here buy me and go rob a seven eleven right or even even the um the little um toy guns look real . I mean yes they that 's really gotten bad I 've heard so much about that on TV and that 's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one . Or your child -- Yeah . -- accidently . If your child is old enough , I mean , there are a lot of kids who when they 're ten look like they 're twelve , Right . or fourteen or , and , and , especially some of the minority children . Whether , Uh-huh . you know a racist or not , that 's the truth . And , And if some of them are doing something that they should n't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands and a cop comes up , Right . I mean , you ca n't blame them . It looks -- You ca n't MUMBLEx , -- like they 've got a weapon . Jeez and you ca n't take the chances . That 's right , Because there 's been kids that age who have killed people . Exactly . And , you know , you know , there was a law in , I think it 's in Oregon , where they 've now made all toy guns , they 're making them neon colors . Right and I think , that 's a good idea . You know like , yeah , and the kids do n't care . That 's right . My kid did n't care . I know . He picks up a stick and goes bang . 

Right , right . It does n't make any difference to him . A gun is a gun to them . Yeah . They can play with anything and make it a gun . 

That 's exactly right . Yeah , so you like to do , I think they ought to do that with toy guns , they ought to make them very reasonably -- Right . -- do something outrageous to them . Right . Exactly . You know , so that they 're not very distinguishable from a real gun . That 's right . That 's a good idea . I was , uh , watching T V yesterday and there is a town in Georgia , and it 's the law that you have a gun , every adult , you know , uh , is able to carry a gun , 

and , That 's kind of MUMBLEx , and they encourage it . They encourage it ? Yeah . And , the police love it . Which really surprised me -- Um . -- and , and , I think , and that 's what they were going after , uh , they went to interview this town , I mean it 's a little dinky town , they went to interview them about the gun control laws and , uh , the police said , MUMBLEx all the people said , that 's fine we could care less . You know , we 're all honest , and everything like , Huh . that , we , we all carry them , but we , we do n't mind being checked . And , uh , and I think it kind of took that uh , neatness away from it , you know , like , well heck , everybody 's got one , you know and , I do n't know . I , So , it was , it was quite unusual to see the people in that town . That 's kind of an odd thing . I do n't know , I have a gun and , uh , my folks have always had . I learned to shoot when I was real little . Uh-huh . I think that 's a lot of it too , is that people need to teach their kids , Right . what not to , what to do and what not to do . Exactly . Because I started shooting , my Dad started letting me shoot like a little air B B gun , Uh-huh . when I was probably five or six years old . Yeah . But , you know , it was , this is how you hold it , this is the only place that you do it , which , was , Right . you know out far and away and you do n't ever touch it unless I 'm here , and you do n't -- That 's what we 're doing . -- you do n't point it at people , and then they had , then they went to the Texas Parks and Recreation , I guess , but anyway the s- , hunter safety program , Oh , yeah . that you have to do now . I think it started in about nineteen seventy . Oh . If you want , if you want to go deer hunting and your birthday 's after nineteen something , Uh-huh . fifty-five or something , then you have to attend one of these hunter safety courses -- Well , that 's neat . -- or you ca n't get a deer license . Well , that 's real neat . And it , and it , it 's basic stuff , it 's like , it 's do n't , you know , when you 're climbing over a barbed wire fence , do n't point , lean your gun against it , you know , Yeah . and then you crawl over it , Right . and shoot yourself . And , uh , Well , that 's real good . those things happen . It , it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people . Right . Right . And they usually are real basic , Yeah , put the safety on the gun . common sense things . Do n't assume , always assume it 's loaded . That 's , that 's got to be the most common thing that people , I know and people do n't want to believe that . Yeah . 

It 's , oh , it 's empty , it 's empty . 

Boom ! Yeah , well see I , I took the clip out , or whatever and I forgot about the one in the chamber . Oh . Yeah , well we , we 're trying to teach our daughter . She knows real well about , uh , about her Daddy 's guns , Oh , yeah . what not to do and what to do around them . Does he got them locked up all the time too ? When he 's MUMBLEx , Yeah , um , and , and she , and she 's real , um , she 'll know , she 'll even tell her friends , do n't ever , Do n't even think about it , yeah . 

touch my Daddy 's guns or something like that . Yeah . So , she 's real , she 's real good about it . And , she 's never been curious , Um . I mean , cause he 's always , you know , if he has them out , cleaning them , you know , she can be there and he 'll tell how he 's doing it or , you know , show her the insides or stuff like that . Yeah , if you make it where it 's not something , to be feared -- Curious , -- and , not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about . Right , exactly . If it , if it 's just one more piece of something , but they , but they 've got to understand , like you said , never touch it . Right , they 'd have that respect for what it does , Yeah . and what it can do . Ours is a , we have a shotgun , and it 's up in the closet , Uh-huh . and then the shells are in another part and it 's something to think about , and I got it because my husband used to travel , and be out , he was out of the country at one time for three months . Oh , yeah . And , I was like , I live in a nice neighborhood , but still , still . and then I 've got it so far , sometimes I think , I wonder if I , I 'm not about to load it because I , you know , I assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there , Uh-huh . and it 's in a case , and it 's , you know , it 's put up and it 's away and all that , Right . but , I do n't want to take the chance and , I think , if somebody ever does break in , He 's got to go to a lot of trouble . it 's going to take me a year to find the shells , Yeah . and then get it , hold on , hold on , Yeah . He 's in here somewhere , I know he is . Right . Yeah . Well , I know how to use one . We , we go hunting every once in a while and he showed me how to use his guns and I really enjoy it but , boy if someone did break in , I do n't , I do n't know that I could or would even grab it . I know , I , I used to think about that , it was a lot easier when I was , when I was single , it was one thing and when I was just married with no kids , Uh-huh . That 's true . when it was just me , it was an easy decision . Yeah . It was like , you , you come after me , you 're going to get it . 

Yes , you know , and now there 's so many other things , where are the kids , what are they doing , Yeah . you know , where is this person coming in from , Right . uh , you 've got , and , and , if , if you manage to get it out and then , you know , what , how can you even afford to , to think about what , what you 're going to do because you do n't know where your kids are , True . at the same time . True , well we , we have dogs -- Ugh . -- that are pretty , you know , very protective , you know . We feel if they make enough noise that , Yeah , if they 're stupid enough to come through then . Yeah . 

It , it , we have two big dogs in the backyard , Yeah . and always kind of thought that too , kind of an extra buffer . Yeah . They 've got to be pretty stupid , and , and most people that , uh , break in or whatever , go to houses without the dogs , Yeah . luckily . Anything , that the , well any , any advantage that they can take . Right . And , that 's one of them so , 

Unfortunately , yeah . Well , Guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years . Yeah . Really does . Well , do you think we 've , Yeah , I , I think that 's about all I can , Me too , on gun control . We , we 're in pretty good agreement actually on it . Yeah . I think we are . 

It would be an interesting , it would be even more interesting you , you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum . Right . Right . I 'm glad you 're not . Me too . I 'm glad to find there 's another reasonable person in Garland . Okay . Well good ! Well , it 's been nice talking to you . You too , thanks . Bye-bye . Bye-bye . .
