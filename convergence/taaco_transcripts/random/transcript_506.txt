Okay , I guess it took , so I guess the recording has started now . Yeah . Uh . So , have you ever served on a jury ? I served , I was in the Air Force , and served on a court martial , uh , board a couple of times , which is very similar to a jury . A lot of the same rules apply . Have you ever served on one ? Yeah , I finally served on one last year . I 've , um , been voting for years , and I could n't figure out why I had n't been called yet -- Uh-huh . -- and I finally was . So it was an interesting experience . I was kind of boring . Was it civil or criminal ? Uh , it was , uh -- A grand jury or , -- uh , it was , uh , well , let 's see , it was municipal court -- Uh-huh . -- so it was a combination of , uh , and I was in the pool for a couple of weeks -- I see . -- so it was a combination of criminal and civil , and they had , uh , well most of the time we , we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors -- Uh-huh . -- and then , it was always exciting when we got called to , to , to go , because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides , uh , just sit in the jury room . Uh-huh . Uh , did , did the judge , uh , hand down sentences or did you folks do that ? Uh , yeah , the judge did . Uh , I , uh , I had a hard time getting seated on a jury . I kept getting , uh , I 'd be questioned , uh , for empaneling the jury , and -- Uh-huh . -- they kept , uh , dismissing me . Um . Course they do n't have to give a reason , but it 's just -- 

No . -- whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like , you know , they want to get the best , uh , mix for their case , so -- That -- -- they ask all kinds of wild questions . -- that 's a science in itself . Yeah , well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions , and I think part of it was they did n't , uh , they did n't like the fact that I do n't drink any more . So . Uh-huh , I see . Because you 'd probably be , uh , too puritanical and -- Yeah , that was -- -- MUMBLEx . -- probably it , although in my case I might have been more , uh , sympathetic with the person who got caught , I do n't know . Uh-huh . So , uh , were , were the , uh , sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair , or would , if you were deciding , do you think that they would have been different . Well , I was never there , never there for any sentencing . Uh , I finally got empaneled on one case , uh , on my next to the last day , and , uh , we got into the , uh , jury room to , uh , decide the case , and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he did n't need to deliberate , because he 'd already decided that the guy was , uh , not guilty , and he would never vote for guilty . Huh . So , uh , they appointed me jury , jury foreman and I , uh , did n't think that , uh , going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict , so I told the judge that we were n't , were unable to reach a verdict because we could n't get one member of the jury to deliberate . Um . So the whole thing had to be tried over again . Wow , I bet that made him happy . 

Yeah . Yeah , it was , uh , it was funny . The , uh , I ju- , I , I do n't know , I , uh , I did n't , uh , uh , I did n't like not being able to deliberate . Right . I , uh , I , I wanted to vote guilty for the guy , and the other people were kind of mixed -- Uh-huh . -- so , uh , the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again . Cost him a lot of money , I 'm sure . Yeah . Oh , how many members were on the jury ? Was it a six or twelve member jury ? Uh , it must have been six . Uh-huh . Yeah . That 's kind of curious to me . 

I did n't realize until the , uh , Wayne Kennedy Smith trial , uh , a few months ago that they had six member juries . I thought that they , you know , it was always twelve , twelve men tried and true , so to speak . Um . But , uh , apparently for some , some crimes , it 's permissible to have six people sit in judgment . Um . I know on a , getting to this unanimous thing , whether , you know , a jury should be unanimous or not , or not , in a court martial case it does n't require the jury to be unanimous . It 's a simple majority , you know , rules . Yeah . Well , let 's -- MUMBLEx . -- see , is it on , uh , capital crimes that they have to be unanimous 

and , 

Probably on capital , I do n't know , we were n't , we , we , the two that I were on had to do with drugs -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , we were , uh , unanimous is acquitting the person , even though we in our , in our , uh , gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends , because of various things , the government really failed to prove its case , and , you know , being fair to the person , if the government does n't prove its case , no matter how you feel , you have to go by what 's offered as proof , and we had to acquit him in both cases . Uh , it was too circumstantial ? Uh , yeah , it was , yeah , in some of the critical things , like the off- , special investigations , at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person , but something happened to the camera and the tape and -- Um . -- all they could do was testify ,
