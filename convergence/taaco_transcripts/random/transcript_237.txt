Okay , uh , have you , did you , have you grown up in Dallas , Stephanie ? Uh , no I 've only been here for the last ten years , uh , Oh , where are you from ? I grew up most of my childhood in Germany . In Germany . Uh , and , Well , we , we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance . Now there 's a place I 'd like to visit . So we , we travelled all over Europe . Oh , that 's neat . When I was , when I was very young . Unfortunately , a , a little bit too young to really appreciate . Uh-huh . Uh , I was grade school age . Uh , My hus- , my husband had a bicycle tour of Europe , or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war and so we 've seen lots of pictures of the , of the beautiful , Um . spots and , That , areas , that would be a , to me , a really nice vacation -- -- because I 'm , I 'm not in physical shape for something like that , but , uh , I , I sure would work on it , if I had an opportunity like that . Yeah , that 's neat , neat . What kind of vacations do you like ? Uh , well my husband and I are scuba divers . Oh . H- , So , we both like to go to dive resorts . Uh , we went to Hawaii on our honeymoon , Uh-huh . and we dove there . Uh , but , we , we did about six dives while we were there . And , uh , we were originally planning on going to Cayman , Oh , uh-huh . uh , last year -- Uh-huh . -- uh , but , we were n't able to get enough people together for the trip . We had to have , like , eleven people for , Oh , uh-huh . this package , uh , deal . Yeah . Uh , and we could n't get enough people together , uh , to go , so it ended up falling a- , falling through . Yeah . We were going to get a really good price . When , when our children were younger , we enjoyed , we lived up in , uh , New York , Uh-huh . or New Jersey and , and used to like , uh , traveling into upstate New York and camping -- Uh-huh . -- and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and , that sort of thing , but we 've never really , uh , did any diving or anything . Little bit of s- , of , uh , uh , , oh , Snorkeling ? 

s- , water skiing . Oh , really . But , not much of , uh , Um . of anything else . Uh , Well , my husband and I both like water , Uh-huh . so any , any vacation that we go on is usually , It 's got to be the water . involves , close to the ocean , Right . or , or something like that . When , when we were in Jersey , we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot , and really enjoyed that a lot . It 's really , they had , Yeah , we , 

a really nice beach areas there . After we moved away from Germany , we moved to New Hampshire . Uh-huh . And I lived there for seven years . Oh , I see . Uh , That 's a really pretty area , too . 

and I really enjoyed that because , you know , the mountains were real close , Uh-huh . we like the , we like the white mountains and , Yeah . Uh , unfortunately , I did n't really get to go skiing much while I was there . I went skiing once . Yeah , we loved the , we loved the , the New Jersey area , too , because the the lakes were really pretty close , you know , you could , Uh-huh . you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and , and just really , and then we were n't too for from the Appalachian Trail , we did quite a bit of hiking , which is kind of fun . Are you a , you a hiker , or not ? Uh , Not so much , huh ? Not , not really so much . If , if , if there was some place that , that we went to where there was hiking involved , I , I would be you know , happy to go hiking , Uh-huh . but we , we never have really planned a vacation around , uh , places to go hiking . So your , your next , your plans are try to find someplace to s- , scuba dive . Yeah . Our next vacation will , will be scuba diving , I 'm sure . You have any children ? No , not yet . Okay , then that 's probably one of the reasons our , we had little children all the time , Yeah . so some of the things are not as , quite as , uh , adaptable . Yeah , it 's a , it 's a little more , difficult planning a vacation , Yeah , it is . when you have , have children . You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy , too , 

and , Yeah . so , I think , wha , Yeah , and diving is something that , especially for small children , uh , I think the , the minimum age for diving is , Yeah . is probably , legal anyway , would be probably about sixteen . Eleven or twelve , I would think , probably but , maybe fifteen even . Yeah . I know that , uh , uh , one of , one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family . You know , we go wherever somebody is , Uh-huh . that we have n't seen for a while . So that , that 's kind of , uh , we just came back from , uh , uh , Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate , from , uh , with his Master 's Degree in social work and so that was fun , and , and the summer we have a , we have a , a reunion in , in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities . Where we 're going to camp for a week with as many members of , of a rather large reunion group that , uh , as we can get together so , That , that sounds like a lot of fun . 

Ye- , Our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that , too , Yeah . that there were several hundred , uh , people and they all kind of met at a central place . I , I did n't go , Um . uh , but it would have been nice . It would have been a nice vacation . We , we 've tra , we 've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country . I guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe , you know , like a , 

Uh-huh . a small camper . We 've , we 've travelled in a big one . I hate them because they 're hard to jockey around , you know , but maybe a pickup with the back on , Some- , or something like , uh , what 's the , like the Volkswagen Vanagon . Yeah . I 've heard is really nice . So you could kind of sleep in it sometimes , but you would n't want to do it all the time . Yeah . Uh , we have enough friends here and there , I would just love to just drive through the United States and stop and see people I know , 

Uh-huh . and visit for a day and then go on and , you know . My dad has been talking for years about , uh , getting a fifth wheel -- Uh-huh . -- and just picking up , he 's retired -- Uh-huh . -- uh , he 's in his sixties , and he , uh , would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there , Yeah . and just , you know , not , 

Yeah . be settled anywhere , Yeah , I think , just see , see the rest of the country . I think that would real , and I would like to maybe not take great long trips , but , but have your home base , where your home is -- Uh-huh . -- and then just travel out for , like , maybe , oh , a month , maybe go , 

He , he does that quite a bit . And , He , he has n't lately , though , uh , because he 's been ill , Yeah . uh , but he 's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time and , you know , he 'll say , this is my itinerary . I 'm going here , here and here and I 'll be back in about two months . Yeah . There are a lot of neat , neat places to visit in America , that 's for sure . 

We 've , I have n't been much to the south , I have n't been in , in Georgia or Florida or Mississippi or Alabama . I guess that 's , those are the only states I have not visited . But , uh , up the coast , uh , at , uh , uh , in Maryland and around there , where the , where the early history is , there 's some Johnstown and , uh , in s- , in that area is just really neat , interesting things to so , you know . Uh-huh . so , Have you been a , to a lot of the different historical sites ? Yeah , we took a trip , uh , around to the , uh , Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something , Uh-huh . I believe it was . Uh , had about three kids then I think , but that was a really fun , interesting trip . I we , we read Bruce MUMBLEx book before we went , you know , and , so we were ready to look up the places we read about . Yeah , I -- -- I think right , right now while my husband and I do n't have any kids we 'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and , 

and adventurous types of things , Yeah . and then when we- , eventually , when we have kids , Yeah . Now , his , his folks did a lot of traveling across country . You know they went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that . Well , now , camping is fun with kids . If you 're , Yeah . you know , once they get a little bigger , not teeny tiny ones , but , even , even some little ones do pretty good but , Yeah . but when they get a little bigger so they can help , that , that 's a fun way to , to , uh , cut costs and it 's enjoyable , too . Very restful . I mean I find , Yeah , I , I do enjoy camping . Yeah , I find the outdoors very relaxing and , you know , kind of a change . As long as I have a shower nearby , I 'm fine . Yeah . And electricity . Well , I 'm with you . I need my creature comforts , too . Yeah . Well , it was great to talk to you . It was nice talking to you , too , Beth . Okay , see you later . Bye-bye . Okay . Bye-bye .
