Tibby is the dog and Liberty is the cat . Uh , wife and I , we have , we have two cats . Oh . Uh , one 's real nice , but the other one is a , well , she 's pretty wild . Oh . Ours are pretty calm . Yeah , are they , um , just house pets ? Uh-huh . Yeah , that 's , that 's what ours are too . Yeah . Our cat we got from the pound the day bef- , the night she was going to be put to sleep . So -- Oh , really . -- that 's why we call her Liberty . Oh , well , that 's a nice , nice story . Um . 

Do you want to hear about my other animals I 've had ? Sure , sure . I 've had a skunk -- Yeah . -- I 've had a Burmese python , I 've had rats , I 've had mice -- Wow . -- uh , let 's see , I 've had gerbils , I have , I had a son , he 's now gone from the home , that was an animal lover . Uh-huh . So at one point I had a snake , skunk , dog and cat running loose in the house . Wow . Um , do the skunk , uh , was it kind of like a cat to have around the house ? Yes -- Yeah . -- it was litter trained -- Yeah . -- and we had it perfumed -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , it was very aggressive . Right . But all the , all three of them , dog , cat and skunk , used to chase each other all through the house . Uh-huh , and the skunk . And the only thing we have with the skunk , he was very , very protective of his territory -- Oh , yeah . -- being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa . Um . Nobody came near it when he was there . Oh . Uh , I had , I had a dog one time , and , uh , he chased after a , after a skunk and got sprayed -- Oh . -- so we had to , we had to give him a tomato , tomato juice bath , and , uh , get him cleaned up , Yeah , they um , ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them , but -- Uh-huh . -- the glands had been removed so , Right , but I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to -- Right . -- to back up and get ready .

Really . So , when he died , we got a little one . Yeah . But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old , and it just , you know , was almost cruel -- Uh-huh -- -- because , -- almost cruel for him to , to walk . Yeah , he just , he could n't get up , he could n't walk , so , he was a hundred and twenty pounds , so it was a chore . Wow , yeah .

Yeah , well , do n't even talk to me , I , when I was single -- Yeah . -- I had gone away for the weekend , and my husband , then fianc3e , was to keep my cat , and he let her out , and my house was loaded with fleas , I mean , you walked in and your legs were just black .
