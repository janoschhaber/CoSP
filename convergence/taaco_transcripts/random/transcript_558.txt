MUMBLEx . Well , we have , we used to , when I was younger -- Yeah . -- we 'd go every weekend . All right . But we have n't done m , l- , whole lot of it lately . Yeah . I 'm kind of into it . I 'm , uh , kind of a sailor . Yeah . I 'm up in Minneapolis now , 

but I was in Florida , so , uh , yeah , I was kind of into it for a while there . 

Were you sailboating ? Yeah , for the most part . 

Yeah -- Yeah . -- I had a little sail , Well , we do n't get to do a whole lot of that up here . No . Just motorboat 's all we , What part of Texas you from ? Uh , Nacogdoches . Okay , whereabouts is that ? That 's between Houston and Dallas . Okay , all right . It 's the oldest town in Texas . Is that right ? Yeah . Wow , that 's pretty wild . We have , uh , Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches , so we do a lot of boating on . Okay , so you got some lakes around you can do that on . Yeah . You do skiing and stuff or , Yeah , little bit . Yeah ? 

All right . Just got through snow skiing . Yeah ? Yeah . All right . Just came back from Denver but , Yeah , that sounds good . Yeah , we 've , uh , our , the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now . Yeah , it , it , it was heavy when we were there though . Yeah . I did n't see any boats there , though . Not , not , not too many , no . But , uh , no , I just got back from a weekend . We went and , uh , had a , kind of a picnic in the woods type thing . It was pretty nice , but , uh , no , I , I have , uh , I had a boat last summer that I took out , a catamaran that I do , did a lot of sailing on and stuff . Yeah ? That 's a lot of fun , but , uh , my parents are pretty big sailors , too , they 're kind of into it . Uh , all we , all we have up here mostly bass boats . Oh , yeah , I guess it 's pretty , uh , fishing 's a pretty big thing , huh ? Uh-huh . Yeah . Lot of , lot of fishing going on up here . Yeah . 

All right . So , where about in Texas is that ? Is that centrally located or , It 's , uh , well , you ever heard of Lufkin ? Uh , no , what , what major city is nearby ? Houston . Okay , and that 's south or north of there or something ? Let me see , Houston 's north . Yeah ? Okay . Dallas is south . Oh , okay , all right . Well , that sounds pretty good . Does , uh , I guess the weather , 

does that stay pretty constant there or , It 's , it 's gets cold at night , and then warm in the afternoons . Yeah ? Probably seventies , eighties in the afternoon . Okay , well , that 's pretty temperate . Yeah , that 's not too bad . But , uh , yeah , have you done , uh , any other boating then or , No , I had n't done any in a l- , uh , lately , but that 's all , I used to ha , uh , have a friend that owned , his daddy owned a boat shop . Yeah ? And we used to , when I was in high school , we used to go out , go boating every day just about . Oh , that 's great . Yeah , I , And we had a n- , different boat every day . Oh , that 's fantastic . Yeah , I used to , uh , kind of be that way myself when I lived in , uh , north western Florida in the panhandle , I used to sail about every day . I 'd work , go to work , I 'd like to do some sailing . Yeah , it 's a lot of fun . It 's , uh , especially if you get a , a pretty fast boat like those catamarans are pretty fast . Yeah , what , You can actually , Do , if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that or they just , Well , actually , I , I 've known how to sail pretty much my whole life . Uh , my family 's pretty into it -- Yeah . -- and , uh , I took sailing lessons when I was about six and then , uh , Is it pretty easy ? Yeah , it , it 's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while , you know , uh , just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and , and the physics behind it . Yeah . So it 's , it 's not too bad , it 's pretty easy to get the hang of , I think and , uh , generally , everybody I 've , I 've known has kind of gotten into it , but some people are more motorboaters , you know -- Yeah . -- which is fine . Well , that 's about all we have . Yeah , yeah , lot of people do n't , do n't see the excitement in sailing , 

but , then , again , they may nev- , m , they may never have tried anything like , uh , catamaran -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , that 's when you really start getting into speed . You know , you actually , some catamarans you can actually pull people behind , the skiers , they get so fast , you know . I did n't know that . Yeah , they get pretty quick , but -- That -- -- uh , -- that would be something . Yeah , yeah , I have n't , I have n't personally done that , but , uh , the races , I , I work with a guy right now that , uh , races catamarans in the summertime -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , he 's pretty gassed about it . 

He 's got a good , uh , What kind of , what lake do you all use ? Well , he , uh , he 's from Detroit -- Uh-huh . -- so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes , I think , and does his sailing . Uh , for me , I , I go back to Orlando , uh , in about a month , and so , down there , basically just go to the coast . We 're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast , and there 's a lot of places there you can go , you know . So , uh , so that 's a good thing . Yeah . But , yeah , so , what do you do for a job ? Uh , I build transformers . Oh , really ? Yeah . Okay , is that for T I or , No , it 's for Cooper Industries . Okay . Are they primarily electronic , then ? Yeah . Okay . Well -- Well that , -- they have a , you know , worldwide , but -- Right .

Been here all my life . Oh , no doubt . Yeah . Okay . I 've never been to Texas . I 've been to Oklahoma , but , uh , that 's about as far as , Oh , it 's , n- , Oklahoma 's nothing like it . Yeah ? Okay , well , that 's good , because I did n't like Oklahoma that well .
