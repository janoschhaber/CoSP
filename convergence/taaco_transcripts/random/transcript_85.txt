Well , in the norman , in a normal route of way we do things , how about the ladies go first ? All righty . Um , well , I , uh , have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year , so I 'm really just starting to get involved in , uh , in what 's out there and how they do things . Um , as far as the system as a whole , I really do n't see a problem with it . I do see a problem with graduating people that , that ca n't read and are not , you know , productive in society or productive to themselves and , uh , I think that 's the main problem at this point . How about yourself ? All right . I 'm , live in Plano , Texas and , uh , Uh-huh . uh , today we 're not even suppose to be in school because the , uh , the way the taxation and all that crap is , there really legally is n't any funding for the school systems in Texas today . 

Right . So , uh , I mean , when you , when you take , uh , uh , professionals and put them in situations , they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education , and they ca n't get their finger out of their ear long enough to , to get that major subject in line , something 's wrong . So , I think here in Texas mainly that the , the , they 're not serious , they 're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what , how the level of education should be for children . I have a one year old so I 'm not , I 'm more opinionated about the observations than , than the true facts , but , Uh-huh . it 's just a shame to me that , that the , our firemen , our policemen , and school teachers are the three least paid utilities , um , that have the biggest impact to our well-being . 

That 's true . I have , I have a real issue with that . Um , I think that if from every year when they , when they pull in the , the , the , uh , test that the last three years , you know , ten , eleven , twelve year , uh , graders take , and , and then you see that their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states . They 're not saying that something 's wrong with the educational system here in Texas , I have a real concern about that , um , as a matter of fact I 'm very content to spend my daughter out of state to college in Virginia , Uh-huh . uh , verses having her go down here and not learn anything , and then , uh , so I 'm , MUMBLEx my opinion I think there 's a big concern hope , hopefully the new , uh , education , secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but , uh , I do n't know , they 've got to quit worrying about , uh , the , uh , religious , uh , overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product . Yeah , I think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people , you know , special interest groups can blow up , Uh-huh . and , uh , and not really get down to teaching what 's important . Teaching these kids , you know , how MUMBLEx really the basics is what it comes down to . Exactly . I was astonished to find out that , that across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed . Is that right ? 

Ha- , they do n't even , a lot of the school systems do n't even , uh , the kids nowadays do n't even know what , what the president 's fitness education program is all about , Huh . they do n't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school . I remember . And , yeah , and , uh , I talked to a thirteen year old last night who 's , uh , goes to , uh , one of the Plano high schools or junior highs , I guess , and she said that she had a choice , she could either have taken tennis , or weight lifting so she choice to take weight lifting , over the regular gym , 

I mean , give me a break , I mean , the kids sit there and they , and they drink cokes and eat popcorn for , for lunch and , And talk , yeah . then go out there and lift weights and do n't learn anything , it 's just a real , I have a real problem with the whole system . Huh . They need to put some sternness back into the , into the teachers and let them be able to , uh , get the old whip out and get some discipline . Yeah , then it comes down to what you said before though about them being some of the lowest paid public , you know , public service , Uh-huh . employees that there are , I used to , and yet they 're so important . I used to date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level . Uh-huh . I mean , I was absolutely flabbergasted at what , they wo- , what she was paid . True , she was young , you know , but still it 's the principle . Right . Of course , if she got her Master 's degree it would all be different . But , uh , Well , you know , it 's hard though because then you start talking taxes and , Oh , taxes Lord forbi , that 's a bad word . Lord forbid , taxes . Goodness gracious , if we would , uh , plan our expressways a little better , that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads , we 'd cut that in half and get some teachers we might have us a problem . There 's an idea . Maybe I should run for office , huh ? . Run on that then , no income taxes in Texas , huh ? That 's true . I 'm in Texas too , so , That 's funny , that 's funny . Well , that 's about all I have here . Well me , too , I , uh , I think we both agree there 's some problems there but , ma'am . we 'll , maybe do our small part to fix them up . Surely . I 've enjoyed it . All right , you too . Bye , bye . Bye .
