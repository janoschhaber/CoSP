Okay . Um , I guess what , I guess my task . I usually ride my bike . I have , uh , a stationary bike and , uh , a regular bike . And when I can , I like to ride my regular bike outside , because it 's so much nicer . The stationary bike is , is so , uh , Boring . boring . But I have head phones , and I , plus I have it , uh , in the living room so I either watch T V , or we have a fish tank , so I watch the fish , you know . Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied . If , I like to have the T V on , because that usually keeps me , um , more occupied . It kind of takes the time away and I do n't realize , really , that 's really the only time I ever watch T V , is when I 'm on the bike . But , and then usually after I 'm done riding the bike , just to cool myself down , I usually take a walk , you know , and that just kind of gets myself , uh , gets me , you know , to where I 'm not quite as tired I guess . But it 's definitely a task . You think so ? I ca n't say that I really enjoy it . I wish that I did enjoy it more , 

but I do it because I have to not because I want to . I bought a stationary bike , but I find that if I sit on that seat too long , it hurts . Yeah , yeah . And I have n't figured how to get that soft , and I tried even tying a pillow to it . But two years ago , I joined , well , it 's not quite two years , it 's almost two years , I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano . Uh-huh . And I love it . Really ? I just love it . So is it just women that go there ? Yeah . It 's totally women . See , I think that 's what 's my biggest problem with going to a place , uh , a , a health club . Because I do n't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise . You know , so I have tried to just do stuff at home and , uh , I just feel conscious about it . I mean , I 'm not big , you know , or anything , but I still do n't like other people watching me . I like to be able to sweat , have my hair a mess . Yeah . Uh , feel that , okay fine , if my bathing suit slips a little bit I do n't have to be conscious -- Right . -- of it being a little bit too low . And I , my bathing suit 's just one piece , so there 's no big deal all the way around , but -- Uh-huh . -- I do n't have to be conscious of what I 'm doing or how I 'm doing it . And it 's , uh , oh , it 's just , I do n't know , it 's , it 's a total free relaxation . Because , hey , you can do what you want . You 're a female , and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing . That 's what , And they 've got such fantastic equipment in there . Really ? That 's , Oh , yeah . that 's great . How , And I love the water aerobics . I love the water aerobics . Do they have a pool or what is , Oh , yeah . They 've got a nice one . Huh . They have two types of water aerobics . They call it aqua exercise , I guess is what they call it . I 've heard that that 's really good for you to do . It pushes you because you 're pushing against the water -- Uh-huh . -- in itself . So it is like double strenuous . But you 're not being double strenuous on your own body . Because you 're pushing it yourself . Uh-huh . So you 're doing it yourself . So you do n't really feel like you 're really working that hard , do you ? Huh-uh . When you 're in the water ? Huh-uh . The only thing that I ever felt was , every time I stop and start going again , because I end up getting two jobs once in a while . I end up having to quit for a while . But I get blisters on my toes on the bottom because , Oh , wow . . I really jump a lot . Well , that 's funny , I never would have thought of that . Well , a lot of people wear those little , uh , terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom . Especially around the pool . So they just -- Like wat- , -- wear them right into the pool . 

Are they water shoes ? Is that , Yeah . They 're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with -- Oh , okay , okay . -- rubber , you know , soles , Okay , 

okay . so that , you know , no big deal one way or the other . 

Huh , that 's really funny . But , I never think about it until after you go there for about a week , your toes , you start getting blisters anyway . So no big deal . Huh , that 's , But it 's fun . So , how often do find yourself going ? Um , on a , if you 're doing it on a regular basis , how often do you go ? I try to make it at least three times a week . Yeah . That 's really , For a while I was doing it every day . Just , Really ? going , uh , five days a week . I wish that I could make myself exercise every day . But I do force myself to do it at least three times a week . Which I do n't feel like is enough , but i- , it 's , it 's at least something . You know , it , it , I just force , I have to force myself to do it , like I said , because to me , I really do n't enjoy it . But I know that I have to do it . I mean it 's just , it 's , it 's not a question of whether I want to , you know . Well , But , When I was working up at , uh , The Summit , Uh-huh . here in Plano , I 'd leave there , and I 'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock . Oh , that 's , Oh , actually about four thirty because they start at five to six , so I was there by four thirty , every night . And the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet . Uh-huh . Because no matter what I did or how I did it , I invariably got myself wet . Uh-huh . But the water only comes up basically to your , anywhere from your waist to your , oh , chest , I 'd say . Yeah . So I mean , it 's your choice where you want to go , but , Did you ever , I enjoyed it higher . Well , I 'm sorry . That 's okay . 

Uh , did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I ? Did you -- I have a , -- ever try that ? I have a bad back , so I 'm very limited what I do . Oh , okay . It 's like I can walk , but if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it 's going to bother me . Um . Especially when you 're on cement or anything that 's hard , it will bother me . Then that would , yeah . it will bother me . I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you , would n't it ? 

Well , that , what pushed me that way though , was basically was the fact that when I went in there , is was n't for the water aerobics . I went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles . 

Oh . And , uh , she said , Hey , go for the swimming pool . She says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor . She says in fact you get more . Wow . I said , okay , because I 'm not a swimmer . Uh-huh . I like water . I 'm not scared of it . But I could n't , I guess I could swim across the pool , but I 'm no swimmer per se . Yeah . But I found that this worked really well . 

And I came out of there and I saw my stomach going down well . Oh . I dropped , oh , I 'd say almost twenty pounds . Wow . Just by watching what I ate . And they fix you up with a diet , which worked real good . What if you 're already on one ? I mean , What ? A diet ? Yeah . I mean , when you go in there , they would n't make you do theirs . Would they ? Oh , no , they have nothing to do with that . Okay . See I joined , uh , when this one down here opened up , I joined as a V I P . And the V I P gives you , uh , oh , gives you a diet , a computerized diet . And they go over all your health and all your history , and they show you how , everything to do , and how to do it , and the whole nine yards . So it became part of the package , so I went through it . It worked out well . But they have packages where they just offer the exercise program . Is that what you 're saying ? Oh , yeah . You can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too . I see , okay . I just went and took the , because they were offering it as an opening benefit , so it was , it 's less than what you pay now for going in there , Um . after all this time . So it 's like when I got laid off , I went back in there , and start all over again because it had been a while since I 'd done it . Um . So I get all the same treatment again . So it 's kind of nice . Wow . That 's , Like I said , I like it . I like the heat . I like the , I jump out of the swimming pool , and I go into the hot tub . Oh . And I love it . Yeah . That would be really nice . Because I have n- , I have never , let me reword that , I think I have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore . But that 's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did . Uh-huh . That 's , I knew I was pushing too far . Uh-huh . But usually , when I go into the hot tub before I go swimming , or when I come out , I 'm totally relaxed when I go home . It 's no big deal . So you really do enjoy your exercise then , since your , It 's fun . It 's fun . Uh , I 've gotten on the bike . And they 've got , uh , the stepping bike , where you step . Uh-huh . And I 've enjoyed that , watching how well I can walk up and down stairs . That 's , you know , I wanted , But most of the others to me are very dull . I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike , but I got talked into the bike instead . And I do n't know , I really wanted a stepper . I 'm considering maybe even buying one of those too . But I 'm not sure if I 'll get benefit out of both of them . I mean , I do n't know if it would really do any good having both of them . Which one do you feel is better , since you use them both ? Um , I get bored very easily . Uh , the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit . Like you said , you can sit and do it , and watch the T V and not even really be conscious of what you are doing . Uh-huh . With the stepper , you are conscious of what you are doing because you 're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down . Huh . So you have a little , you know , little , you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so , Uh-huh . to what your gear is . 

Uh , I , it would depend upon which one you want . I think now that I 've had the bicycle , 

I would go to the stepper . But if I were you , I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while . Because you can buy a month 's membership . Oh , really ? And see what you feel is best for you . Um . Because it all depends , you know , for everyone their own what they want to do . Because I jump on the bike here at home . Mine has its , see , the handle bars go up and down , Uh-hum . so I can sit there and read and listen to music , like what you said , and it has no effect on me . So I mean , it 's boring . Uh-huh .
