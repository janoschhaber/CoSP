Hi Ed . Hi . Hi . Uh , books , I 've , actually I am reading a couple of different books , uh , one wa- , is , uh , a story , well it is not a story , it is a collection of , uh , of memos , supposedly written by Howard Hughes , uh , Oh . that was , uh , that was , it came out a couple of years ago and I have just now gotten around to reading it . I have had it a couple years , but , uh , jus- , jus- , , Who wrote that ? Oh , I do not remember the man 's name , he was , used to be a reporter for , uh , I think , the NEW YORK TIMES , or the WASHINGTON POST , one of the two , and he supposedly got this , this , s- , story , uh , I mean this , uh , was contacted by this guy who had these , these memos he wanted to sell , and they were , they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the , uh , corporate headquarters in , uh , in Los Angeles . Huh . They , on I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something , there in Los Angeles , they used to have a , or , I guess they still do , uh , had a , uh , uh , big warehouse kind of thing , which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a , uh , you know , for the size of the company which , inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected , he , he was , uh , a great collector of everything , he , he , he did not , he did not throw anything away and , uh , supposedly this guy had , had been breaking there for awhi- , he was a , like , you know , burglar , had been breaking there awhile and , uh , I see . And had ended up , he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect , and they , uh , they broke in one , one night and found a bunch of memos that were , uh , supposedly from , from Hughes to , uh , to his main , uh , main a , assistant back , uh , in the fifties and si- , well , I guess , in the sixties , Well , that is interesting . up until his death . 

Right . 

So , it 's pretty interesting work so , That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that . Yeah , it 's a , it 's a little , it 's a little hard MUMBLEx you have to plod through it and , you know , it does not have a real story , or any plot , Uh-huh . you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on . And , they have not made a movie of the week of it yet . No , I have not seen it .  But it 's , but it is , it is real interesting , Yeah . uh , I also reading , uh , the , uh , thi- , it 's a , an old , another old book that I happen to have . I am sort of rereading it . It 's , uh , a book about , uh , the Bermuda Triangle , but it 's , uh , it 's about , it 's a real good book that a guy , uh , wrote who was , uh , a research librarian , he wrote , uh , sort of debunking many of the , uh , uh , MUMBLEx the stories about the , uh , Bermuda Triangle . You know , he , he was thinking many , Uh . 

many of the the myths , many of the myths of the triangle were , uh , actually , could be explained , Explained MUMBLEx , and , you know . Uh , and the rea- , reason I was , MUMBLEx picked it back up was in light of all the , uh , MUMBLEx Well when they found the , uh , the airplanes on the , in the Atlantic , thinking they were Flight Nineteen . And I do n't know if you are familiar with that at all but it 's , uh , Flight Nineteen was one of the , uh , was a , a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two . Right after World War Two , and they were , they were lost and , uh , Supposedly scooped up by the triangle . Yeah , they were . Yeah . And so , and in the book , you know , even , he wrote this book back in the seventies , and even , and even then he , he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water . And , uh , because he , he mentions , he , he goes through and brings out points from the Navy 's findings and so forth . And , uh , it 's probably , you know , real close to what , you know , everyone is thinking , now that , they just got turned around and could not find their way back . Yeah . On that same topic , have you ever read anything about , you know , the Amelia Earhart story , whatever happened with her ? Uh , no , I have not . I , I think that would be , I am sure there is something out there , uh , MUMBLEx , Yeah , I would I would like to , too , because it 's a lot of things coming up here lately about her , you know , possibilities of he- , of where she MUMBLEx , I thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years . Uh . Well whatever , this is one aspect of it . Yeah . Of course , you know , it is so weird , cause no one will ever really know , it 's , it , tha- , so but it 's entertaining 

and it makes you think about things . Right . That is for sure . Yeah . So , that is pretty much for right now , that is , Yeah . what I have been reading . I kind of like to read different stuff 

and , uh , I like to read a novel every now and then , but , uh , I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time . Right . Well , I , I guess I just have not read anyth- , I mean , usually , I just , if I find a good book , I will sit , you know , for two days until it is finished . If it 's that good , Yeah . 

and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow 's and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT . Yes . And I just really , really liked the way he writes . It 's just , Yeah , I read that , too . I got it , uh , right , incredible . after it came out . My , uh , you know , Yeah . he was an , an assistant district attorney in Chicago at , uh , and while he was writing the book , and , uh , my sister-in-law lives in Chicago , and she had , before it actually got big , she sent me this book saying , you might like this , this guy is , you know , Uh . from here . And , uh , I read it and really liked it and then about , that is when it really got big . And , uh , so I , That was good , I think . MUMBLEx . And , and the other book I am trying to think , you know , like was in the last year and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY , uh , BONFIRE OF THE VANITY , BON yeah . I have not read that , although , Uh . I have heard it is pretty good . Yeah I , that was really , really good , the movie was nothing compared to the book . Yeah , that is what I have heard . And . 

Yeah . I saw the movie , and , uh , Oh , the movie was a joke compared to , I mean , because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive , Yeah . when it comes to , you know , pinpointing , uh , so- , so- , society 's ills and , Right . things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things and , Right . and so , it was , it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie . I know . And , anyway , we are not talking about that , 

but , uh , gee , I just I like to read gardening books and things like that . Just to tell me what to do with my garden and , uh , Yeah . And , uh , I have a lot of , uh , uh , computer books that I am , I do computer work and so I have a lot of those . So , I spend a lot of time looking through those , not necessarily reading them but , Yeah . looking through them . But I , I 'm interested in a lot of that , but , uh , I have got a lot of books that I , I intend to read , but I have not been able to yet , you know , for one reason or another . Like , what is a book on your list , you know I have a list too and I have never gotten to it . Oh , gosh , I do not , I do not really have a list , cause I just kind of , uh , I just have all the books out , you know , I have book shelves and I have them all out and usually when I am through with one , I will go in and , uh , uh , uh , look , look through , uh , I have one now and I , I can not remember the name of it that I , that I got is the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or , or Christmas or something will send me another , another good book and , uh , Oh . uh , sh- , I have one and I can not remember the name of it , uh , it is supposed to be a mystery .
