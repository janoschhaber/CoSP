Okay . Hi Norma . Hi . Have you taken anything back lately , uh , that you 've bought ? Well the only thing we 've taken back recently are plants . Well why ? Shrubbery , that were guaranteed 

and we had no problem with it . Very good . We got our mo- , got our money back . Good . Well wh , do you think that , uh , consumer goods , goods are generally getting better , or worse in quality ? Well , I believe they 're better . I do too . I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time , but I do n't , I , I believe that they 're better now , you know , wh- , I think so . I do n't think they 're shoddy , not as shoddy . Electrical appliances I think are pretty good , r , reliable . however , I did n't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty-three thousand miles on it . Right . And I do n't like it very well if , when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at , uh , on one side . 

Oh , did you return it ? No , I had moved away . No , uh-huh . I had taken the first one back . I did n't think that it heated well enough . It never did get anything but just moderately warm , took it back and , uh , the people told me well that 's the way it 's supposed to be and I fell for it and , uh , when I got this one it did , a lit , it heated a little bit warmer and then after one year it started heating only on one side . Huh , so either you or your husband can be warm but not both . Also , I took an iron back after having it only one year . Oh . Now I figure th- , uh , anybody that is dumb enough to iron , needs to have an iron that will last a long time , and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last . No , huh-uh . Did they replace it ? Well without even any question , but I think it was the store . Uh-huh . Wal-Mart . Wal-Mart , I was going to say , it must have been Wal-Mart . Yes . And , uh , well , have you been buying any clothes lately ? Any new clothes ? I have n't bought any new clo- , well the last thing I bought was a dress last Summer . And the buttons turned on it ove- , over the winter . The buttons tarnished slightly and I have not gone back about it . That was poor quality , I think . I think it is too , and it was an expensive dress . I wondered if it were n't expensive , Yes it was . and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever . That 's right , that 's what I think too . And one belt loop , the wo- , uh , you know , like the chain link , chain belt loop -- Yes . -- half of it raveled out . And that was , I believe a Leslie Faye dress and it was , I think , over a hundred dollars . You spent that much on your dresses ? Yeah , I do n't usually , but I did that one . You 're really divulging very personal information . But I think it should have been better than that , for that money , is what I mean . Oh , of course , I do too . Well I believe that we 've been talking about five minutes . Okay , 

I think so . And Norma , it is just wonderful to talk to you . Good talking to you too , I 've enjoyed it . You are a good one to talk about consumer goods , because you keep up on it all the time . Well , we 'll be talking to you later . Bye , bye . Bye , bye .
