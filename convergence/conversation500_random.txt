A: Well , uh , I do n't know .
A: I think the budget is really out of hand right now ,
A: and especially in this election year , I think that , uh , there ought to be so- , at least some conversation about what --
B: Uh-huh .

----- Topic 1 start at 4 -----
A: -- we are supposed to do about this .
B: Yeah ,
B: it kind of seems to me that everyone 's offering , you know , their token little tax cut program , you know , when it 's --
A: Right .
B: -- when it 's just such a bad time for it .
A: Right ,
A: and , uh , well , as you said , mostly they are token cuts .
A: Uh --
B: Yeah .
A: -- especially what , for instance , George Bush is offering .
B: The ninety-seven cents a week .
A: Yeah ,
A: ninety-seven cents a week .
A: Now what ,
A: that 's really not going to do a lot of good , it does n't seem to me , to your average --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- middle income person , you know .
A: Another ninety-seven cents ,
A: hell you can buy a coke or something for that .
B: Yeah ,
B: I mean , mostly it 's , it 's not actually a , a , a cut ,
B: it 's just a cut in the withhold , in the amount withheld , you know .
A: Yeah .
B: Um , yeah
B: I do n't see this MUMBLEx changing my lifestyle a whole lot .
A: That ninety-seven cents really is n't going to do it for me either .
B: Huh-uh .
A: Uh , I , I have n't really heard much of what the other people , other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either ,
A: especially the Democratic candidates do n't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah , maybe that could do something to affect our budget --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- at this point .
B: Yeah ,
B: I mean , you know , in retrospect , um , was it , was it Mondale or Dukakis that said , you know , I 'll , I 'll tell you right now I 'm going to raise taxes ?

----- Topic 2 start at 37 -----
A: I believe it was Dukakis --
B: It was Dukakis ,
B: yeah .
A: -- but I , I ca n't .
B: I have a lot of respect for him .
A: Yeah ,
A: I mean that 's better than George Bush who came out and said , No ,
A: I will not --
B: Yeah .
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- and then , you know , ten months later he said , well , sorry , you know , I , I ca n't follow through on this .
B: Uh-huh .
A: But it seems to me that , uh , that the budget is so out of hand ,
A: and especially now that they say , Okay , the cold war is over
A: and we 're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of , you know --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- of X number of billion , trillion dollars a year .

----- Topic 3 start at 54 -----
A: Well , I 'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go ,
A: because , in my opinion , I do n't think I 'm ever going to see any of this peace , so-called peace dividend .
B: Oh , yeah .
B: Yeah ,
B: it 's , it 's .
A: I mean , if they could actually put something together and make ,
A: I 'm not really in favor of large government social programs , either , because I feel that they waste --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- money , also ,
A: but with this peace dividend , it seems like you could set up some kind of like --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- public works projects like they had in the thirties , or whatever .
B: Oh , yeah ,
B: I , uh , I , I think that would be a great idea , you know , like the conservation corps , you know where .
A: Right ,
A: ex- ,
B: It wou , it wou , it would help unemployment greatly .
A: Exactly --
B: And it .
A: -- and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country .
B: Yeah ,
B: infra structure is in , is in ,
B: I mean , we , we , we have hurt ourselves incredibly MUMBLEx last fifty years in the --
A: Yeah ,
A: and --
B: -- cold war .
A: -- and there 's no way that we can ever really recover from , from the state that we 're in right now , unless , at least I feel , unless we focus on the infra structure ,
A: and I surely do n't hear anybody saying that right now .
B: Uh-huh .
B: Um , yeah ,
B: I , I agree totally .
B: Um , I mean , this , this , it just seems so , you know , so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen .
B: Um , I , I 'm in college right now ,
B: and .
A: So am I .
B: Oh really ,
B: where do you go ?
A: Uh , I U .

----- Topic 4 start at 92 -----
B: Right ,
B: I go to Georgia Tech , um .
A: Uh-huh .
B: And , in ,
B: what ,
B: I had pol , you know , the required political science class --
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- a couple of years ago .
B: And one of the things we discussed was , you know , where our , where the budget situate- , how the budget situation just got so out of hand .

----- Topic 5 start at 101 -----
A: Right .

----- Topic 6 start at 102 -----
B: And essentially what happened was ,
B: I think it was like in the , um , tax year of eighty-one , um ,
B: Ronald Reagan basically said , you know , I 'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and , and , created this , this ludicrous budget that he knew , that , that , um , that the Congress would not in their right mind pass --
A: Right .
B: -- and Con- , Congress , realizing that they were going to lose a , the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war , you know , bye-bye , you know , bye-bye removing the tax cut --
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- further cut the taxes and created , you know , that , that , that , you know , created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit .
A: Right .
B: And you just , MUMBLEx .
A: You , you just have to wonder what they 're thinking in Washington .
B: I mean , it 's just like they 're playing chicken with a loaded gun .
A: Yeah ,
A: uh , well , it 's , it 's more than a loaded ,
A: it 's a loaded cannon .
A: I mean --
B: Yeah .
A: -- they 've got trillions of dollars to spend every year ,
A: and they , in my opinion , do n't do a very responsible job --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- of spending that money .
B: Well , yeah ,
B: um , what really bothers me is it just seems like if , if anyone were to say , you know , well I 'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we 're MUMBLEx , we 're going to have to do some unpopular things , I mean , he would n't have a chance of getting elected .
B: I mean , it 's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing , you know --
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- where people just want , want to have , you know , whatever will make them feel good , right now , you know .
A: For , for the moment ,
A: and that 's what really is getting me about what George Bush 's stand on the budget is right now --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- is that he is saying , I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you 'll be happy come November , and you 'll elect me again --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- and then I 'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- or you know , it does n't seem that it 's going to make much of a difference .
B: Uh-huh .
B: It ,
B: I mean , I do n't know ,
B: I I do n't , I do n't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week .
A: No ,
A: no ,
A: not at all .
B: I just do n't think it was a well thought out incentive .
A: No .
