Oh . And I 've never been there before . Oh . And found that there 's , uh , individual vendors and the foods are wonderful . And one of the , uh , the , um , vendors had cakes . All sorts of wonderful cakes . Uh , they , fresh str- , strawberry cheesecake now and , and so on . Oh . And it 's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake . Um , which is really not such a bad price . I decided I , I just could n't quite make myself , um , buy it because I do make cheesecake and somehow -- There you go . -- I did n't want to do that because it , but I was very tempted because it looked wonderful , and the- , they had black forest cherry cake and all those things . Oh . That ar , but those are homemade . They are not , um , commercial bakery made . And in that they are made in their homes , um , so it , it 's kind of interesting , uh , it 's out there if you want to pay the price but , Oh , it is . I mean , we have bakeries around here that , you know , you , you just gain weight going by the door , Right , you know , just like that . just smelling the air . Yeah . Right , but I do n't know I guess some of the best things I 've ever had , um , I , some of them were just hors d'oeuvres , you know . Uh-huh . Doing little hors d'oeuvre things that , I have a kick making that , I mean , you know . Yeah . I get off on strange little details of food , I guess . But -- Yeah . -- um , gee , we have so much going on here because you know this is Dallas , this is the southwest , this is , Uh-huh . you know , chips and Picante sauce and anything hot . You know you can always make it hotter , Right . and , and lots of stuff like that , you know , so . That 's , um , a really good party time , Yeah . eating all that hot food and , and they just love it , you know , down here .
