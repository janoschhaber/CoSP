Uh , J C Penney 's come down from New York and , of course , T I and Xerox from Rochester and we just , have lots of people from everywhere . Yeah . Lots of industry coming in , and it 's a very wealthy community . Uh , not that I am but other people seem , to be and I would love to know why but I mean they do .
