Now we 're ready . Do you have a personal computer ? We have one . You do , in your home ? Yes , yes , ma'am . I do not have one in my home . I use one all day at work , but I do n't have one at home . Do you wish you , Do you find you use it a lot ? I do n't use it as much as my children and my husband do .
