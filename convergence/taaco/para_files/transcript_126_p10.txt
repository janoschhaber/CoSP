I try to go real late or real early before they get there . Yeah . There some things I 'd like to try , but , you know , sometime when I ask , I just feel like , boy , am I stupid or what . Uh-huh . Well that 's one thing I like about the Spring Creek place . At least the fellow that 's there , one of the fellows that 's there at night and on weekends is real helpful .
