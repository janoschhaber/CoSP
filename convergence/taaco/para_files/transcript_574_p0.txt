I , uh , get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio . Uh , that is one of my big sources for current events information . Uh , I really like that coverage . My wife , uh , on the other hand is home most of the day and she watches a lot of the cable news network . Have you seen , uh , h , have you , uh , ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED ? No , we do n't have the , uh , national public radio in , in my area . Uh-huh . I can hear it at the , uh , uh , oh , the college town nearby when I 'm in Stillwater , which is about an hour away , but the F M signal does n't reach this far . Uh-huh . Uh , I 'll listen to shortwave quite a bit . It gives you a whole different perspective on the news , uh , when you hear it from , say , a European -- Uh-huh . -- point of view , or from the country of origin . Uh , I agree with you , too , on the , uh , uh , the cable channel , C N N and HEADLINE NEWS .
