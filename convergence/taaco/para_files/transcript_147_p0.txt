What kind of lawn and garden work do you do ? . Well , right now the place where I 'm living , the yard was basically neglected for about the last twenty-five years , so I 've been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn , and after three years of working at it , I 've , I 've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back . Instead of mowing in the same direction every time , changing , one day you 'll , or one time you 'll cut it , cut the lawn the long way , then you 'll go the opposite way , instead of going lengthways , you go width , and it helps the grass come back .
