Well , ironically enough I 'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because I resumed an aerobics class the night before last . Oh , no . I ripped the ligaments in my right ankle . Gosh . Yeah so , Exercise is not supposed to do that to you . That 's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way , you know , down the hallway . Do you do anything on a regular basis ? Well , off and on , off and on . Right now I 've been off but , I 've been going over to the fitness center . Yeah , that 's a good , yeah , I , Yeah , three times , My husband 's a T I -er in the MUMBLEx unit here . Well I try to go over there at least three times a week , and I try to walk , um , at least five times a week . Do you , when you go to the MUMBLEx , I have to ask you , and if this is getting to MUMBLEx , we 're not supposed to get too particular , but I 'm just curious , when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged , either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek , in terms of , there 's so much , it 's so much of a weight orientation , weight lifting , et cetera . Yeah . Uh , well , I 've been going to Spring Creek . I have n't been to the Dallas one now in , oh , a couple of years . Uh-huh . At least since they 've redone it , supposedly redone . So I do n't really , Yeah , it- , well , it 's not that great , and I go to the Spring Creek one on and off . But my husband 's working over there and he just goes to the Dallas one . But I just do n't , I mean , it 's just so much weight lifting . Even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it . Yeah , that 's true . Or is that what you 're into or , No , No , well , I 've used the Nautilus equipment . Uh-huh .
