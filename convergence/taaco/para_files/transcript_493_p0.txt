Well , uh , what is your favorite kind of music ? Well , I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be , uh , classical music . Oh , same here . Oh , really . Yeah . What type of music do you like in the classical area , or what era do you , era do you like the most ? Oh , well , I guess I like a wide range . Uh , everything from , uh , from Baroque through at least some modern music . Uh-huh . And my wife and I these days are especially into opera . We 've been sort of opera fans for a few years now . Um , do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages ? Well , we , uh , generally , the places we 've gone they sing in the original languages . Uh-huh . Like the Dallas opera here normally does , I guess . Uh-huh . I , I have n't gotten into that too much because , I , uh , if I do n't know the story line and , um , I do n't speak the language , then I have difficult time , comprehending what 's going on . Well , one thing that 's helped us a lot is that , uh , you , you know , you can buy a lot of these operas now on video casse- , uh , video tape -- Uh-huh . -- and so we have quite a collection of those , and you watch them at home , and they have subtitles ,
