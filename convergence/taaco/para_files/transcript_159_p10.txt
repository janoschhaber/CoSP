Uh , we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football and I did keep statistics for his team , and , Oh , great . his Dad did take movies of the football team and movies of the basketball team , and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time . Yeah . So , wh- , I feel that I learned a great deal from my students , uh , with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents . And a thing such as , uh , one of the biggest complaints I well remember because I spent a lot of time with seniors , uh , was , um , carrying their MUMBLEx when I was your age I did n't have this or that , Uh-huh . and I know I never ever said that because I knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people . Well , I guess that was good that you were , you were hearing it from other students . Yes , and I had to deal with their problems and I could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect and our son would share this and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of , of , uh , lines . So that , Well , um , I think he benefited from my experiences . Does your son work for T I ? No . Oh . No , he , uh , works , uh , for a different company . Yeah , in the Dallas area but when he went away to coll- , and he was on the lawns from the time he was in the seventh grade and , uh , a small MUMBLEx and all the way through college and he held three jobs . Wally was in college and we did n't even know it . Oh , goodness . He did n't even tell us . Uh , that he had three jobs but when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account
