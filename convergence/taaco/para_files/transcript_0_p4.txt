Well , my , uh , my , uh , probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision -- Uh-huh . -- than just delegate it . I think that they , they had a great deal of , um , all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference . That 's great . And , I mean , it was just , it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family , getting down together and doing that . That 's right . And , and just the children were involved in the decision , because it involved just them . Right . Yeah . And , you know , making that decision and then finding a place and everybody had duties -- Uh-huh . -- to perform . You know , whether it was just , you know , giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot , Uh-huh .
