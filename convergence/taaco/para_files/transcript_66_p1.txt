Most of my fishing has been in the saltwater . Oh , really , Uh , mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish -- Oh , neat , -- and , uh , I have caught one or two small sharks -- Oh , really . -- and , uh , yes . What 'd you do with them ? Put them back . You did n't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do ? No , no , no , I love shark steak , but , uh , the ones I caught were never large enough to really do anything . Do they have a limit on sharks , I mean , is that like a , a sport fish , can you actually catch those and there 's no limit . Is there a limit ? I have no idea . I know , I , my home is in , uh , Pensacola , Florida -- Uh-huh . -- so , it 's , they do a lot of shark fishing in that , you know , in the gulf -- Right . -- and , um , there 's a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf coast from , I guess from Galveston to Mayport they have , uh , shark tournaments , and , you know , there 's part , either as part of or separate from the , uh , bill fishing tournaments they usually have -- Right . -- so , I have not done , uh , much freshwater fishing -- Oh , really . -- oh , for , you know , lake , lake fishing for bass and so forth -- Right . -- but , uh , maybe some what they call brim -- Uh-huh . -- and those sorts of things , but nothing , I think I 've been trout fishing once . I 've never fly fished . Have you fly fished ? Uh , no I have n't . I do n't know that I could do that . That looks awful tiring . I 've tried it -- Did you .
