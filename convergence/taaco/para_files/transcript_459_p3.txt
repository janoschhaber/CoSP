that 's a good idea . It 's , it 's real easy , I like doing that part . Yeah . I 'm in favor of very little clean up , um , very -- Uh-huh . -- little planning -- Uh-huh , yeah . -- because we 've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games , and -- Uh-huh . -- it 's , we invariably end up at my house since I 've got two kids . Uh-huh . And that , it 's , it 's fine , because then I can just say , Okay fine , you bring this , you bring this , you bring this , we 're done . Yeah . And it 's pretty cool . Yeah , that 's good . Well , one of my favorites if I do n't want to have other people bring stuff , I just want to treat them is -- Uh-huh . -- to make chicken and rice . Oh . It 's very easy to . Oh . You do n't like it ? Oh , I love it .
