I 'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other , you know , since I did -- Uh-huh . -- you know , complete a survey in one area , I 'd switch to the other . So I know the greetings in about ten , and how to do market stuff , but in about , uh , about five I guess , I can do better in it . And my French is pretty good but it 's , uh , MUMBLEx French so , uh , I 'm terrified to speak in , uh -- In France . -- in France . Yeah , because they 're real snobby about their language and MUMBLEx French is street French and I just picked it up off the street and I knew what I was , I knew what I was communicating , but I did n't know what I was saying . I never sat there and got a direct translation and said something here when I came home and French to somebody and he paled and said , uh , I 'm not going to tell you what you said . So , since then I have refrained from speaking any French . So . In MUMBLEx . Uh , I do n't know what I said to him but , uh , I did n't ask him either . Must have been terrible .
