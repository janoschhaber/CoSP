Oh , okay . Uh , to one level down from assistant description . Oh , okay . Okay . Oh , well , it sounds like you 're pretty much into computers . Well , I sure need them . Uh , there 's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to , to try to do my job without them . I can believe that . Well , it 's , it 's been interesting . Yes , uh , maybe you 'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things . I think that 's when you , you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have . When you start seeing what all they can do for you . Yeah , of course , needs and wants are n't necessarily the same thing . Well , I understand that , you know . MUMBLEx if , needs and wants were the same I 'd have a four eighty-six machine at home . I wo , is , is that the newest thing now , the four eighty-six ? Right . That , that must be a fairly recent release . Uh , that 's , came out around the first of the year . Okay , okay . Because I , I had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes , but I did n't know they had a four eighty-six just yet . It does a few more things , Uh-huh . uh , than had been available before . Yeah . But I 'm not sure that it 's such a massive improvement . Uh , you know , once you get passed thirty-three megahertz , all help is , kind of lost in the , in the translation . Sure . Because you no longer can think that fast anyway . Yeah . Well , okay . I enjoyed our discussion . I did too , and you have a good day . You do the same . Bye-bye . Bye .
