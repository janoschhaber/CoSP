So , what kind of music you into ? Well , I have a , uh , pretty wide taste , uh , in music , ranging from progressive rock to jazz to , uh , lot of different forms of , uh , music . In fact , it 's easier for me to say , uh , the types of music that I do n't like are opera and , uh , screaming heavy metal . The opera , yeah , it 's right on track . I like classical , but I ca n't deal with opera at all . And heavy metal , uh , it 's noisy . I 'm into , uh , some industrial music that 's , a , a bit even harder than that . Uh-huh . But it 's , it 's got to have a point to it . Oh , I do n't mind music that 's difficult to listen to ,
