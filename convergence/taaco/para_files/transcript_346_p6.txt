And then what my father did was , was , uh , in- , you know , obvious to me and I , I helped out with it . But , uh , although I have brought my boys into to see where I work , it 's not that easy , and it 's , it 's certainly not at all common , and they , they just do n't really have that same idea , Right . so th- , they , uh , it 's a , it 's a whole different , uh , kind of thing there then , uh , My husband has taken us to work with him , and we still do n't know what he does . Yeah . So , we just say he travels a lot . So , that kind of covers it . Yeah . Yeah . Well , that makes it hard though for in terms of , you know , family time with , Yes . with him . Yeah . Yeah , I 've been lucky in that respect that I do n't , uh , do n't travel too much MUMBLEx . He 's been on temporary duties where he 's been gone nine months . Oh . Yes . Yeah . So those are the real killers . If he 's just gone , Yes . he 's gone three weeks right now and that 's , that 's mild compare to the big ones , Yeah . so we just , you know . I just do the carpooling and , and handle whatever needs to be done . And something major , Yeah . always needs to be done . Yeah . So -- Yeah . -- you just have to , to handle it until he gets home . Yeah , right . And hopefully he wo n't have too many surprises when he gets home .
