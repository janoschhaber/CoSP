this is the first home we 've lived in we 've had a sprinkler system , Oh how , and boy , it is really nice , Oh . it sure beats dragging hoses around . Yeah , you can have it come on just early in the morning . That 's right . And , and off by the , you know , by the time you 're up and about . That 's right . It 's really nice . Yeah . I , I usually get it started for my wife -- Uh-huh . -- and I , and she moves it around ever other day . I 'll have to admit I do n't , I do my own yard . I , I really do n't enjoy doing that . I enjoy having a nice looking yard , Uh-huh . I just do n't enjoy the work , Uh-huh . that it takes to get it done . Yeah . I had a lawn service to do my yard for me -- Uh-huh . -- during the real hot summer months , you know , until I retired and now I , I 've lost my excuse for that so I have to , for the last couple of years I 've done it myself . Yeah . Sometimes I wish I could get one of these , uh , chemical services to come , Uh-huh . out and spray for weeds , Yeah . and fertilize , Uh-huh . and all that and take that one step out of MUMBLEx . Uh-huh . But , uh , they want too much money . It is kind of expensive , it is . Yeah . Of course , the chemicals themselves when you buy them , they 're expensive too . Right . Right . But it 's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself . That 's right . If I have a problem discipline , you know , I think , now , boy , I really need to get out , you know , and apply something , you know , and I screw around and do n't do it or wait too long or something . Right and the weed come up , That 's right . and all of a sudden you 've got to do something else .
