My budget or philosophy , I guess , is spend as little as possible . Well , that 's , that 's good . And , uh -- Especially for these times . -- and it 's , it 's sor- , sort of always worked . Uh-huh . Uh , but that depends , you know , on the individual if they can I guess have self-control . Well , that 's a lot of it . Uh , I know we tried several different ways . One time we tried something that really worked but we did n't keep it up . I passed it on to a friend and she wo n't quit doing it . She loves it and that was the envelope system . Uh-huh . Where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend , and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that . So you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera . And then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form , uh , causes you to realize how much is left .
