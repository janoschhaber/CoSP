And I just loved the neighborhood . Yeah . And I mean , everyone , everyone had houses like that . They were all completely different . Uh-huh , that 's right . and so neat . Yeah , ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big , oh , I guess , it 's twenty-eight by fifteen front porch . Oh . Next door , we 've got an Austin stone . Across the street , the guy , it was burnt out about two years ago and , and the guy moved in and completely redid it 's got , oh , it 's got a rounded front on it . It 's all brick , and he 's , he 's landscaped his yard and he 's about ready to put in a pool and things like that . So , yeah , there 's a variety , you just do n't see it anywhere else , as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot . Now , why could n't your wife run around the golf course ? Is that not good ? Oh , she could , a little bit . We , I tell you what , we got into the fitness center at Methodist and they have a quarter mile track there . So she has started doing that rather than uh , rather than take off . The problem is she 's a school teacher and for her , she ca n't run in the morning . For her to get home and try to run at six o'clock in the night , in the winter time , it 's starting to get dark and , you know , you do n't want to , she does n't want to be out by herself anywhere in Dallas . Regardless whether it 's north Dallas or whatnot , when she goes over to this fitness center , it 's fenced in , and there 's somebody in the building , watching her and all that , so there 's a lot of consideration .
