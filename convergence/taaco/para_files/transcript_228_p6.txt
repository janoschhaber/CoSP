it 's always ran just fine , the clock and stuff . Uh-huh . But it runs about ten minutes fast , except for about a month , for about a month the , the clock ran normal . Um . And then the power went off again , lightning or something knocked it out and we hooked it back up and now it 's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again . Um . But on the east side of the house it runs fine . Oh boy , you do have a strange wiring problem there . He put new wiring in , it 's all new wiring up in the attic , Uh-huh . or I guess crawl space , Uh-huh . but , uh , oh , no , he did n't know what he was doing , he really should have hired people . Well that 's something , my husband 's in construction and he wo n't even touch electrical stuff . He , i- , I mean , he 'll do a little MUMBLEx things but he wo n't do any major rewiring . He says he 'd rather pay the electrician to handle it . Right , he 'll end up killing himself . Pardon . End up killing theirselves . That 's right . My husband , he 'll change out a light switch , but that 's about as far as he 'll go .
