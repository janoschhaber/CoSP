Okay , um , I do n't know about you but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like every day . I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next . It 's pretty bad , but it 's true , you know , they tend to try to be , you know , real lax and supposedly the policy is like , you know , we , you know , we , hire these wonderful creative people and we do n't want to smush their creativity , you know . We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want . And , you know , you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next . Well , I 'm kind of that way too . I work in the legal department
