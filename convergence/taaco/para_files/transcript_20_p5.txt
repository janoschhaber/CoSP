Right . Because I , Well , I think that 's the only thing you can do , is just say no and mean no and , Yeah . It 's like , not be tempted . I 'd like to know where they determine that I 'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say , you get this much credit line . You know . Well , i- , You 've already been preapproved . oh , absolutely , preapproved . That 's their favorite word . Yes . Everybody in the country is preapproved , I think . I think so , you 're right . So , Well , it 's interesting , uh , that , uh , Yeah . people have the , generally the same view . Uh-huh . of credit cards , Yeah . no matter where you go . And , then , some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find , you know , one day they find , wow , I did n't realize I had this much , That much stuff . you know , I 'd spent this much money . Right . And , then they ca n't meet the minimum monthly payments on it . Well , and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own , Uh-huh . and , I mean , that does nothing , but exacerbate the entire problem . Yeah , it does because you 're , you know , you , you 're , you know , you 're just co , costing yourself more money because you , if you ca n't make the monthly , the minimum payment , you 're paying interest , That 's right . again so , That 's right . Yeah so , Well it 's been enjoyable talking with you . Yeah . It 's enjoyable talking with , seeing that somebody feels the same way , so , well , Right . Well take good care . Take care of your little ones . You , you too . Good luck . Uh-huh . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
