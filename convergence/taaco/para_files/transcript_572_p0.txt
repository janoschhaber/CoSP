Okay , looks like we 're ready to go . Capital punishment , uh , the problem I have with capital punishment is that , uh , uh , it 's supposed to be a deterrent to crime , but I do n't think that it really actually does that . I do n't think it deters anybody , because most of the time crimes are , uh , are committed with a , without any thought to the consequences and they do n't think that , uh , stop and think and say , well , maybe I should n't do this , uh , because , uh , I might get the gas chamber or something like that . They worry about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it . And , uh , how about you ? Well , I think that in some cases , it is warranted . Uh-huh , I do , too , yep . And I do n't , I think in some cases it does n't matter if it 's a deterrent or not . Uh-huh , yeah , you still have to do it . I , I mean -- I , -- I mean , I 'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer --
