and , you know , it 's like you 're , I mean , employments are contractual by nature anyway -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that , where I had to , uh , uh , do a drug test and , and it 's , it was kind of a long story , but it was , it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through , and it amounted to , uh , going in , uh , before any of these interviews , I 'm not even working for this company , I 'm going in for , like , interviews and they flew me out to Chicago and , and , uh , before I went into any of the interviews , uh , they took me to the doctor to give me a physical . They said it was going to be a physical , you know , and , uh , actually bec- , beforehand they told me they were going to , uh , do drug screening , but I had forgotten about that , and so , basically , I 'd already peed off in that morning and , and when I got in there , I did n't , I was n't , like , able to give a full sample , and so -- Oh . -- they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes , drink a whole ton of water -- Right . -- before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again , and the , and the , the procedure is utterly humiliating . You go in there with the doctor , he makes you take off all your clothes and then he examines you .
