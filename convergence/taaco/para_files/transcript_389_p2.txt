I , I know with our , our long winters I , I enjoy watching it . I do n't know if it 's just because I like the game or I just like to , to see the warm weather . Uh , well , we can usually play here year around . Sometimes in January it 's not too comfortable to play . Uh-huh . But there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play , and I 'm pretty much addicted to golf , so . I get out there one way or the other . Yeah , that 's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter you almost have to relearn every spring to , to get back out . It 's a good game though . It 's very challenging and the reason I like it so much is because I 'm essentially playing against myself . Yeah . That 's the way I look at it . I , I play in , in lo- , a lot of groups and but I , they keep score and , between themselves but I really do n't care . Um , I go out and each shot I say , well , this is what I 'm going to try to do -- Uh-huh . -- and then I see how close I can come to that . Right . Yeah , you always work on trying to improve each day and , Yeah , and i- , inevitably one facet of my game is n't working at one time or another . Either I 'm not driving very well or I 'm not hitting long irons very well or I 'm not putting well or , but sometimes it all comes together . Yeah . Yeah , I know what you mean .
