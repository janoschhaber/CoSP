Is n't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange ? Yes . Yeah , oh , yeah . MUMBLEx . He does have some real bizarre things , I think . Uh-huh , uh-huh . So , other than that , I do n't know . What 's that ? Guess I 'm not much of a T V person really . Yeah , well , I guess it was n't a real good topic for us , but . Well , tell me , is it snowing up there ? Um , no . No . It snowed a little bit , um , probably about four days ago -- Uh-huh . -- and they said we were n't going to get any more for Christmas . Yeah -- Oh . -- there is snow on the ground . Well , that 's nice . I , I wish it would snow a little bit more . I 've heard it 's raining there . Oh , gosh , we 've broken all sorts of records . Oh really . They 've got , I mean , we still have some highways closed , and it stopped raining almost twenty-four hours ago . Oh , my goodness . But , um , oh , just phenomenal , I mean , I , you know , you see it on the news all the time , but until you 've really seen it , it does , it does n't really hit you . Yeah . But I was driving home from work Friday , and I saw , there were some stop signs , I mean , submerged up to the writing on the stop sign , and that was just -- Oh , goodness . -- it was amazing to me . Oh , gee so . So . So there has been some flooding and , Oh , there 's been a lot , yeah . MUMBLEx . It 's , it 's too bad but you know , the thing is that this happens , in the last three years it 's happened at least once a year , if not twice . Uh-huh . But the people continue to move back in the flood zones . Oh , gee . So , I do n't know . I mean , you got to wonder how long they 're going to keep doing that for . Yeah . I do n't think I would . Oh , boy . Because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood . Yeah , oh , what a mess . Yeah . Well , now , do you work for T I ? Yeah , I do ,
