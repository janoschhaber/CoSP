No , it , Because I mean , there 's a lot of people that , uh , I mean they could require , you know , ob , obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because I 'm , you know , there 's a huge part of the population , not a huge part but a , you know -- A growing part . -- the AIDS population I guess that have it , that do n't know they do -- Uh-huh . -- are spreading it . But , again , to require , you know , such a test and jus- , and then to make , make it MUMBLEx is to subject them to , to discrimi , discriminatory practices and other things . I do n't know , uh , I do n't know how exactly I feel about that . Maybe chop their weenies off .
