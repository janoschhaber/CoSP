Of course , I feel like once I 've done it , if I 'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes , because you 've already kind of shot your night . Right . But , um , so I 'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday , Thursday now that I can just kill two nights , and -- Yeah . -- and , uh , get a reasonable amount of workout in . Does it cost the same for just two nights or , No , it 's less expensive . Well , that 's good , too . This one was only forty-five dollars . But I 'm glad it 's not too totally cheap , because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more , probably . Yeah , yeah . Since it 's more expensive , I think , Okay , you spent that much money , you 'd better go . That 's right , that 's right . So hopefully . Yeah , yeah , it 's right there , and it 's , they have a really nice facility at the T I . They 've got two different aerobics rooms , they have the mirrors . Of course , sometimes you do n't like to see the mirrors on the wall -- -- you do n't like to see how you work . But , I guess , sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going . But , Yeah , and then they hire private instructors ? Uh-huh . Oh , that 's great . And they have ceiling fans in the rooms , and it 's , it 's a pretty nice setup . Um , and of course it 's real convenient , because it is right there at work . I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere , I 'd never make it . Yeah . And just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the , the recreation center and do it helps a lot .
