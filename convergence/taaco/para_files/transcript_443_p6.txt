Well , no , it seems like she does n't write as often as , oh , well , like Danielle Steele and those silly things . She writes the same thing . Well , she can , she can turn them out overnight , I swear . Yeah , and , and they 're the same silly things , I mean , if you 've read one , I mean it 's , Yeah , I 've never read a whole one of hers , I do n't think . It , it 's practically the same thing over and over , you know . And think how rich she is .

And then make movies out of some of them . Uh-huh . You know , mini series and so forth , and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often . I have not seen as many of hers . Well , hers are so involved , and they 're so -- Uh-huh . -- such a higher intellectual level , because she quotes a lot , you know . I think she does a lot of research , too .
