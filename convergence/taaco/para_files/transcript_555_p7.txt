Uh-huh . I mean , these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret . The , the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild -- Uh-huh . -- and , you know , they should expect something like that to happen . And so bas- , now it 's like ferrets are outlawed in the town . Oh , did it attack the child , then ? Yeah , it , it bit him . Uh-huh .

Well , the -- Had n't , they had n't , -- the people that owned him should have been on the -- Yeah , I mean -- -- lookout for that . -- they really should have , should have expected it . And taken the precautions . They did n't . Sure , yeah . It 's too bad it happened , though . Yeah , because then the , the animal 's in trouble , and not the person . Right .
