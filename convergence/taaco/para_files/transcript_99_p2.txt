I think on the lines of , make , how do you , you cook crawfish ? I , in fact , I just came back from the grocery store and being in Texas we do n't have too many , you know , people that , that eat crawfish but they had live crawfish , Oh , yeah , on sale . um , you 're not supposed to , I mean , you 're not supposed to eat them dead . I mean , Uh-huh . well , you eat them dead but , Do n't buy them that way . Right . Because if , if they are dead for too long , you can always tell whenever they 're cooked if they 've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out . Uh-huh . And you 're not supposed to eat those because they 're bad for you . Okay . Well , I 'll remember that . Yeah , so if you ever go in a restaurant , order crawfish ,
