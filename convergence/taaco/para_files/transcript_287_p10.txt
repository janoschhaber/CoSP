huh-uh . you know , what you know about that . Uh-huh . I am not either , but , uh , that is one area where it , that I can see might change , but I really doubt will change . Yeah , yeah . Not for a long time anyway . No , probably not . Huh-uh . So , uh , uh , how about , what in particular would you think that , uh , women still , other than the work place , where women still are being , uh , oh , you know , MUMBLEx found wanting , you know , or not re , as highly regarded as men would be . Uh , I was just trying to think . Oh , I know something . Uh-huh . Maybe you could te- , what do you think that , what do you think , tell me what you think about this . Uh-huh . The , uh , the , uh , the role of women in combat roles during the war ? Oh , oh . Because , I know that there , now there , they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles . Uh-huh , uh-huh . And the only , uh , branch in the armed fo- , services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force . And , Huh . uh , I spoke because women were filing , flying missions into , you know , for whatever reason , into , uh , in the Persian Gulf war . Yeah , yeah . And so . But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job . It was real interesting , they were . I was listening to some of the comments on ra- , television the other day , Uh-huh . uh , about it , and , uh , one of , one of the men who was a , I do not know if he was a general or , you know , what his rank was , very high . Uh-huh . He said , MUMBLEx it 's just a personal thing with me .
