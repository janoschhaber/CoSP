Because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder . Right . You know , Yeah . I , and I believe that , and this is one of them . Yeah . Because these little girls will never be the same . Huh-uh , that 's terrible . Never be the same , so , I do n't know , it 's , it 's really scary and I do n't know what to , I do n't know what needs to be done , you know it seems like there 's no room in jails to put them in jail and when they do put them in there , you know , we- , I 'm taking a business law class at night and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney and , Oh , gosh . so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases , you know and he said you can pretty much , you know if you ever get on a jury , you know , you 're not told this , but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess , whatever you sentence them to , they 're going to serve about a quarter . It 's going to be reduced , right , uh-huh . They 'll serve , they 'll serve a quarter of it , Yeah . so , if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years , do n't sentence them to fifteen years , sentence them to a hundred . Yeah .
