So I have no doubt that he 'll , I mean , I , I think overall he 's been a , a , good figure for the Soviet Union . I mean , I think his intentions and his ideals are , are uh , well intentioned . Uh-huh . And in the long-term , but I just think that because of the basic needs that the people do n't have , I think that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him look , look worse that what his , um , what his ideals are , personally . I agree . What 's bad for the Soviet system is that , they have the resources to grow and produce their food , but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should . I think it 's , I think it 's a lot of , uh , oh , how do you put it ? , bureaucracy and , and , uh , one thing , and then all the corruption . I think there 's a , a large amount of corruption on the , the have and the have-nots . Yeah . That 's probably more true than , You know , I -- a lot of people realize . -- I know you 're going to have that with every society . At least we 're more blatant about it , but it 's very secret , and it 's been going on for years . I mean , you ca n't change things overnight . Uh-huh . And , but if it gets to a point where people ca n't , survive , I mean , there 's revolution . You know , and that 's , It seems to be headed in that direction too .
