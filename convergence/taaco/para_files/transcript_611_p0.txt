Well , we , in , in , in our family , have been pretty remiss in trying to , uh , you know , keep track of , uh , daily finances . Uh , the , uh , way back , what , twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer , I did what everybody else does , which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks , and , you know , checkbooks and all this kind of thing and we kept that going for about a month and it became so onerous that we gave up on it . Uh-huh . That sounds about right . You know , so , uh , the only thing we 're , you know , that we do now is , uh , I keep a , a little spread sheet of , uh , what I call the net worth calculation which is just the , the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth . Uh , and I only update that , oh I do n't know , maybe once every quarter or so . Every three months . Just , basically when the statements come in . Uh-huh . You know . Just to see whether or not we 're falling , you know , getting ahead , falling behind or staying even or what . Right . Uh , that 's really about , you know , the extent of , uh , of the kind of , uh , financial score keeping that we 're doing . Uh . Well it 's kind of difficult for me . Because right now , uh , like most teachers , I 'm laid off and -- Huh . Oh dear , that 's terrible . -- so , um , I spend most , you know , I substitute a lot . Uh-huh . So it 's a lot , it 's very hard on a nonfixed income because I do n't know how many days I 'm going to be called in and whether I am or not , to try to keep track of finances .
