I would go to the stepper . But if I were you , I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while . Because you can buy a month 's membership . Oh , really ? And see what you feel is best for you . Um . Because it all depends , you know , for everyone their own what they want to do . Because I jump on the bike here at home . Mine has its , see , the handle bars go up and down , Uh-hum . so I can sit there and read and listen to music , like what you said , and it has no effect on me . So I mean , it 's boring . Uh-huh .
