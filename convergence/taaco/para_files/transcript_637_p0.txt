Uh , with regard to , uh , to jury trials . I , you know , I , I really feel as though , uh , jury trials are , are , uh , whatever system has been , been used historically , in particular jurisdiction , you know , is really the , the only kinds of things that you can use . Because the , the jurisprudence is , you know , based on , on , uh , you know , on accumulated n- , body of law . And if , if you have a situation where you change that body of law , then all of sudden they , they start , they could start going back and digging up all these cases that , uh , that would be handled differently were -- MUMBLEx . -- they judged by today 's standards . So I , I really do n't think it , they can really do much of anything to change it . What do you think ? . Uh , I , I do n't think so . Possibly in the jury selection would be the only , just for example , what we 're seeing in California I guess . It makes you wonder , uh , had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome . Well wo n't , well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that but then -- Uh-huh . -- then , you know , the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently and , you know , the -- That 's , that 's bad . -- other two guys sat in the car -- Uh-huh . -- and they did n't get beat up . No . It , You know .
