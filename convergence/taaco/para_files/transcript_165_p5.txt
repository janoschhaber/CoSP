I agree . But it just , it , it really does n't make any difference . This is just a , a , another chapter in Middle Eastern history . Yeah , and , you know , and it , there are many of them . There 's no doubt about it . Oh , sure , I mean the , the British occupied the place , the French occupied it , we 've done it . It , it 's happened so many times , this is , this is really nothing special . Uh , Uh-huh . Well , and , and , and so many of the , so many of the conflicts , um , really do n't have a basis in , in , uh , politics or , or human rights or anything like that . It , That 's right , it 's al- , it 's mostly religious anyway . It 's , it 's religious based and , uh , you know , by , by self-proclamation this is a holy war and it is right . Yeah . And then , uh , we , we go on from there and , Yeah , exactly . Yeah , it , it 's , it 's a mess . It , it 's , there 's no doubt about it , and , uh , Well , I , I , I think one of the big problems , I mean looking at it from the Am , the American public 's standpoints , they do n't understand the Middle Easterners . That 's right . They do n't understand what , I mean their politics really is n't politics . It 's religion couched as politics . Uh-huh ,
