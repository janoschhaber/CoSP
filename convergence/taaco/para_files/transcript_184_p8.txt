I had a , uh , Dodge pickup several years ago , and , uh , I ca n't remember the size of the engine it was a three oh , seven or something like that , Yeah . but , uh , I remember working on those cars , you 'd open the hood and there was basically nothing in there but an engine , Uh-huh , uh-huh . and a few things . Now , you open the hood and it 's scary . Yeah . Like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes . The friend of ours over here , he 's got , uh , sixty-five , or sixty-six Mustang the six cylinder . Yeah . And , uh , I was look under the hood of that the other day and like you say , you can see the road .
