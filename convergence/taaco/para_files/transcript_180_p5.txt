It 's like I can walk , but if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it 's going to bother me . Um . Especially when you 're on cement or anything that 's hard , it will bother me . Then that would , yeah . it will bother me . I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you , would n't it ?
