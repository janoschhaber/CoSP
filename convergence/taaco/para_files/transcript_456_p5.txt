seems to me I remember that , uh , I was hired , came in and went through some orientation and I thought I , boy , I ca n't remember . That would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test . Maybe it was during the interview . I came up a couple times for an interview , so it 's hard for me to remember where I was when all that happened .
