As far as I 'm concerned , where it could eventually , perhaps , there 's some problem , uh , pollute the groundwater . So , I do n't know what the answer is . The best answer , of course , would be solar or , uh , fusion , or something clean . Yes . Well , we 've got a problem on the line , do n't we . Yeah . I , I get that sometimes , um , my line gets some static . I do n't know why . Uh-huh . But , uh , solar , of course , would be the clean , the cleanest . Well , I know it 's MUMBLEx , um , we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston and , uh , oddly enough I thought our part of the country was ideal . I ca n't hear you at all for all this static . Oh . I do n't know what to , usually it 's the other phone I have trouble with . It must just , be on the line . Can you hear me ? Now I can again . Okay . I do n't know what , uh , I , I do n't know what the problem is but , uh , when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater and -- -- we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy
