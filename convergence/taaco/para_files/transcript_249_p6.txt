I , I , I do not know , uh , I should imagine Virginia , from what I read , uh , uh , is like every other state . It , it is faced with , uh , uh , enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system . Because I guess , Right . everywhere I read that there is a shortage of judges . Right . Not that they wo n't appoint them but there is no budget for them , I guess . Or , Huh . and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the clerk , uh , Yeah . Whatever . court clerks . So it seems , uh , no , I , I , I do not think I would change it . The more I verbalize it , I , I do not think I would want to change the system . Right , I do not -- uh , I do not think I would either . -- know what we would replace it with . Yeah . I know , it , uh , does seem like the , the , the , the purpose of getting people in jail so that , you know , the , the , I can not think of the word I am looking for . Anyway , the deterrent . Yes . For people to , to commit the cri- , uh , to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away . People have , I do not know , they just do not care any more . The benefit , I guess , of crime outweighs what the deterrent is . Uh , and yet -- You know , people that , -- there are , there are so many , there are so many people in prison . I mean the prison population , uh , as far as I , I , uh , you know , my impression of it is that it has , that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty . Um . I mean it , so has our , I guess our population has grown some too . But there , there definitely is , uh , uh , you know , to me the , one of the worst things that could ever happen , uh , from what I read and see and understand .
