Uh , yeah , this is , the , uh , the , the , uh , mutual defense thing was , uh , we , we , it was complicated , and I do n't think everybody knows the whole situation . I do n't .

Uh , but , uh , the , you know , the French , yeah we go in as an ally to the French and says yeah , we 'll , we 'll help you out , if you get in a bind . Well , they got in a bind and says we do n't want to , you know , play any more -- Uh-huh . -- so , uh , we , we kind of , we kind of got , got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly organi- , uh , um , oh , operations and then the full scale , you know , full scale troops , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera .
