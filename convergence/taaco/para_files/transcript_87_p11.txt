And it , it depends on what it is , you know . But some things , especially letters , if they suggest certain colors for letters , I just go with whatever I want to . That 's what I would do , too . Yeah , yeah . Or whatever I have . There 's yeah , there 's a few designs I guess I 've done myself , but not very many . Real simple ones , you know , I do . I 've made , I made a little , uh , little , uh , little thumb print and made it a bunny . Ooh . It was really easy . I mean , just , just did a thumb print . You know . What . With ink ? Uh-huh . Oh , okay . And then , see I did n't cross stitch the actual thumb print , you know , that was just the ink , and then I made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth . That was so simple . Oh , that sounds really neat . It did n't take anything at all . Did you do , did you use , like , uh , a stamp pad -- Uh-huh . And then I just , -- and ink . Ok so you , just like being finger printed ...
