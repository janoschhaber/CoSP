Well , yeah , if you just , you know we did n't tape anything , we were n't that careful , but it was n't , you know , I do n't know , it 's , it 's funny , it 's like , if you just go slow , you do n't get , or at least I did n't get that many mistakes -- Uh-huh . -- I did n't make that many mistakes , Oh , me , I would have had to have taped the whole thing , and then brushed around the edges , and , and then I 'd have probably rolled it on . I 'd , it would have taken me forever . Why ? Just because you 'd be afraid to do it , or have you done it before . Yeah , well , the first time it 'd probably would have taken me forever , so . Well , it was n't , if it was my own I would have , but my friend said , oh just go ahead , you just go ahead , it 's easy . I said , Okay , it 's your place , Well , how long did it take you all ? Well , a couple of week ends we would go down -- Uh-huh . -- two or three hours on the weekends , and , So there was two of you all ? No , there was , they were doing all sorts of repairs , and there was , I was just painting because I do n't know how to do anything else . Well , that 's easy enough . So , there 's a whole bunch of people . Um . So now I feel like if I ever buy a house , I can probably paint , if nothing else . I think I could probably do it -- Yeah . -- uh , as long as the hardware store told me what to buy , then I could do it . But you know , I went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys , and the guy said , Oh , get this , it 's a nice shiny gloss , which was true , but I did n't realize what , you know , pain it is to clean the brushes and everything , if you do n't have latex I do n't if it 's worth the shine , Uh-huh .
