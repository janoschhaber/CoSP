because , you know , I 've talked to many people and we would n't mind going its extra effort to do it . Uh , If they make it so that it 's not a horrendous inconvenience , I think most people would . Yeah , oh , yeah . You know , and I do n't mind , you know , at first it was the , the little extra money that you got , you know , returning the cans in and stuff like that . Right . But now , you know , I do n't mind as long as things are getting recycled , you know , that we do n't get reimbursed . No , I think it 's , it 's , to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up , Uh-huh . then to get that two cents when you take it to the store . Oh , I , oh , I know it . We still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans , Uh-huh . for cash . But so few people , uh , have enough to make that worthwhile you 'd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back . Right . Yes . And then the , plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also . Now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags ? We have , I know of one that , the one that we use , uh , has , uh , recycling for the bags . Uh-huh . And , uh , and they 're promoting the cloth bags . You know , the reus , reusable cloth bags . Yeah , well , we can get a nickel apiece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused . Oh , that 's great .
