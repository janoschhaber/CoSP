Okay . Do you , have you ever had to put your children in , child care , Mary Dell ? Oh yes . I 'm an old experienced hand . I started back when it was n't , stylish to do that at all . My daughter that 's seventeen now -- Uh-huh . -- I worked even when she was a baby . Oh . And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then I was really lucky to have put them in a , Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist , right off -- Uh-huh . -- of Walnut Hill and Preston . Uh-huh . And it was a wonderful environment . I , I just wish all kids , if they have to be put in day school , could have that kind of place . Uh-huh . I see . So , it worked well . Oh .
