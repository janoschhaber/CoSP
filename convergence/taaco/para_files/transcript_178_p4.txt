Well , that , that says a lot for the , for his ability , though I think . Well , yeah . For Staubach 's , I mean . You know , he was one of the few who come through in history that can really perform , uh , we hope , every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through . In a way Aikman has done some of that . But , uh , the guy winds up getting hurt every other game . Yeah , I , I tell you , it 's difficult in that guy 's position coming into that because there , he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things , you know . Yeah , they did . They put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside . Uh , it 's funny watching them , them play , he 's probably like a lot of quarterbacks , uh , when the pressure is really on when it 's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best . Uh-huh . And I have n't quite figured that out , if they figure they have got it won or if there 's no real hurry because the first three quarters or , uh , if , uh , if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing . They say , hey , we got to do something now . And then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes . Yeah . So , I do n't know I 'm looking for a good year . I guess we 're always looking for a good year . So , obviously though , do you think they 're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the Super Bowl this year or who do you , who do you like to do that this year ? Uh , no I do n't think the Cowboys have got a chance . I think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year ,
