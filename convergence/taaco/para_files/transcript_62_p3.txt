And , and , Yeah . the nature shows . Yeah . Yeah . But , I think there 's enough out there to pick from . I 'm not , we do n't have cable to the point of , of the H B O or any of that stuff . Yeah . Yeah . But , uh , Well , I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children . Because , Huh-uh . with two kids and , you know , I do n't want them watching something that I do n't think they should watch or , Sure . I used to be really hooked on ALL MY CHILDREN , Oh , me . And I watched that for like , oh , ten or fifteen straight years , Oh , no . and then I had , well , you know , I 'd eat like at work , we 'd have a T V or whatever . And then , um , as my kids got older and started , you know , recognizing what was going on , I thought , this is n't really very good . So I gave it up . Fifteen years . Yeah . Bet they hated that . I watched , I had watched it since it started . So , Oh , goodness . Uh , now I , I do n't know who the characters are , and , um , I 'll turn it on every once in awhile and I do n't recognize anybody ,
