Because I have been brought up mostly Italian American food . Because my , uh , parents are Italian and Portuguese . So we cook a lot of pasta , and , uh , gravies , and pizzas , and , you know , roasts , and that kind of thing . Uh-huh . That 's why I enjoy going to restaurants and have , you know , trying different things . Well , have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana , you know , to visit ?
