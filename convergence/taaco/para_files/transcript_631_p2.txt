Uh , they 're certainly all leaders and , uh , and , uh , with their nations pretty , pretty solidly behind each one of them . Yeah . And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the , uh , early decisions of the Vietnam war . That the , uh , people saw the cold war as , uh , you had to draw a line and , and defend it . Otherwise there 'd be , they 'd get you someplace else . Uh-huh . Looking back , it seems like that was only partly true . That , uh , there might have been a better place to draw the line . Uh , I guess you can , I guess you can say that a , a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight , uh , brought the cold war to an end . But I do n't think you can just fight anywhere just , just in order to , uh , call the bully out and beat him . And I have a feeling that that 's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war . They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line , beat them and they would n't come forward . And , uh -- -- we were wrong . But I , uh , you know , the , like I said , the more I hear about it , the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable . But the accumulative effect was to really get into a , a hopeless situation where , and as you say , uh , going halfway was probably worse than , uh , committing , uh , committing to a completely and , uh , winning it , whatever that would mean .
