Yeah , yeah . Oh , yeah . It 's just that , yeah , it 's just that the rating system seems , you know , instead of having X now , they have what , N C seventeen ? Yeah . They just changed it because X had a connotation with it , you know , so , And even on those type they do n't show what you expect . Right . A lot of those are really violent type movies . Right . Really gory . Yeah , that seems to be the norm of most movies , but -- Yeah . -- what the hey . This is America . Let me see . One movie I saw , I guess it was a while back , RED OCTOBER . Yeah . Have you seen that one ? Yes , I have . That was pretty good . Yeah , I read the book before so I knew the story line going in , but they changed some things in the movie . It was n't the same . I thought the book was better than the movie , but I thought the movie was really good as well . I always wait for the movie . I do n't have time to read the book . Yeah . I do n't , I read about one or two thick novels like that a year . Uh-huh . You know , that 's about all the time I can , I can spare . But that was a good show I thought , you know . I read about how they did , uh , an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine . You know , that was n't a real submarine you saw in the water . It was , it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic . Yeah . All those underwater scenes . I thought , you know , it looked to me like it was a real submarine , They MUMBLEx , that was in the water , you know . That 's the magic of Hollywood , special effects . Yeah . I hear this movie F X part two coming out is , uh , pretty good . Is that right ? Did you ever see the original one ? I did n't . It was , uh , you ought to rent the , uh , F X part one . It does n't say part one , but it , it 's F slash X . Huh . What 's that about ? A , uh , special effects man who somehow gets involved in this , um , oh , I 'm not sure . I ca n't remember .
