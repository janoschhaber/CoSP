my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and I just hated it . And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays . Yeah . And , uh , so when I met my husband , he was watching football and I figured out that I could n't see him all weekend . I could n't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL , if I did n't , like football . So , That 's exactly where both of the wives came from I think . Yep . It was , uh , you know , it 's easier to join them than fight them . Uh-huh , uh-huh . And if you want to see them , you might just as well enjoy football . Yeah . And I used to tease my husband sometimes and say , my gosh yo- , did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about , these games . Uh-huh . Well , I do . I just , I love it . It 's such , I just think it 's such a fun sport . And , uh , I 'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet . We 're not convinced that we 're going to be Cowboy fans yet .
