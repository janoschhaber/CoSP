where have you , uh , Oh , I 've been camping for years , not on a regular basis but , uh , I first started camping out in the desert in California . Uh-huh . And then sometimes in the mountains also in California and , uh , then I moved to North Carolina and I , I did n't camp for a long time , and then I started to , uh , go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting , so , I 'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting . Uh-huh . And then maybe camp another night and drive home .
