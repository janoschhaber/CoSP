Well , I remember back during the , uh , during the war , everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on , because that , they were going constantly with that stuff . Right . But , uh . Well , I , um , they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of , and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news . You know , we just do n't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas -- Yeah . -- that we want to hear what 's going on with the economy , what 's being done to help it , what 's going on in other countries , what 's , you know , just more information . If they reported every , if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take , it would probably take the whole news hour . Yeah . But , uh . Well , I guess we 'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the , uh , summer olympics . Oh , yeah , that 's , they start , already they 're having like , um , in the newspaper they have a section , I think , every now and then , on the Olympics , you know , and they 've got like a countdown , it 's like sixteen hundred days or something . I know , we 're trying to get tickets to it right now . Oh , really ? Yeah . That 's going to be crazy that time of year here . But , uh . Yeah . I ca n't believe , I mean , they 're , they 're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over , I guess people want to hear about it . Also big in the news right now is the Braves , because they 're , uh , they 're in , you know , tr- , spring training or whatever -- Right , right . -- and they did so well last year . Yeah , they spent a lot of time , that 's another thing , they spend a long time on sports , and I think that , um , that 's fine , I would like to see more time spent on other things .
