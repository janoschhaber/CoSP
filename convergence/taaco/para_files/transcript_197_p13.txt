But , and you get satisfaction out of it . That 's right , And , I think they underestimate how much , how much value the satisfaction But I think a lot of it , you know , I think things come both from the , uh , individual side and also from the company side because the companies that , let , give the attitude that , well , you know , you 're the last one hired so you 'll be the first one fired , and we just want you to do your day 's work , Yeah . and we do n't really care about you , Yeah . as an individual . When you 've got that type of attitude on it , the people do n't care , No . about their work . And so , It probab- , it probably basically goes right back into the h- , home though unfortunately .
