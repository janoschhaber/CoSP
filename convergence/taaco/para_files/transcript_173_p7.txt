They , uh , yeah , they had to choose between the better of the two , two bad situations , and , Uh-huh . uh , I do n't know what I 've would have done in the situation . Yeah , it begins to make you wonder why we did n't go ahead and go on in and , Yeah . finish the job while we were in there . Right . But I understand why Bush , you know , does n't want to go in and , and uh , take sides . I mean , because that would definitely look like another Korea , Uh-huh . and he 'd have all these people jumping down his back , even though I 'd agree with it . I think he ought to , should 've gone in there and blew them away . Seems to have helped him though , Yeah , it , it , popularity wise . it did a lot . He did a real good job I believe . I have , uh , in-laws that live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too . Hm . It , uh , it , uh , you know , we , so we kept very much abreast of what was going on .
