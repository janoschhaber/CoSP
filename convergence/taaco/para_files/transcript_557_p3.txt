I was really tired of , uh , the Michael Bolton . Mi- , Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he , he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes . Oh , yeah . And I could , uh , go down to a bar that 's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money . Uh , but he picked the right songs and -- I guess . -- and that , that 's about all he had going for him . Or still has , for that matter . That , and a marvelous hairdo . Oh , yeah . Yeah , I 'm sure that , that so , that sold a lot for him . That 's all you really need for a lot of , lot of pop . I 'm ki- , I 've kind of like developed a , a short hatred for , for pop .
