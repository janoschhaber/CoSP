Okay . Okay . So tell me about CHINA CRY . Okay , CHINA CRY was basically the , the true story written by this , this lady who had , uh , was a native , a native Chinese , uh , uh , who was raised by Christian parents . Uh-huh . And her , her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution . I see . Although she , herself , had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other , uh , Christian , uh , portions of , of the faith , repentance , baptisms , et cetera , et cetera . She had always felt a very strong , uh , leaning in this direction . And whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or their , all the clergy and so forth were killed or , or imprisoned or , and the property confiscated , she was safe because she had , you know , not officially joined the , the Christian movement . Uh-huh . So , anyway , she , as she grew up towards maturity , her parents , well , her dad was a doctor and , and he was rather well , you know , rather well to do in the old regime and the , the Chin- , the commu- , the communist Chinese did n't like this at all . You know , the bourgeoisie was , was , was definitely out of , uh , style , then . Right . Everybody was back to a commonality of one . And so they kept picking at him , picking at his , at her mother and , uh , finally , uh , started picking on her . Uh-huh . And getting her to , you know , they were starting to , uh , accuse her of , of , of , uh , crimes and atrocities before the , the revolution and , and had her write her own story over and over and over . Uh , and the , uh , the major point of the movie was that , that she had , uh , married this , this Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court . Now , I think I 'm leaving out a portion . She gr , she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had , uh , gotten a job as , as an instructor
