No , they ended up getting out . They ended up helping several other people though that were , that were stuck . Yeah , huh . Well , so , they evacuated it . Yeah , yeah , they , the whole , the whole campsite was evacuated . Wow . I mean some , I think some people that had fairly sturdy , um , vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water , I think they stayed . Yeah . But everybody that was real close to the water ended up , it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream . I know I always I like MUMBLEx to get right on the water , yeah , by the campsite , it 's so , Yeah . MUMBLEx we have lean-tos up here . I really like them , like I say , they 're kind of , just kind of more sturdy than anything , you know , just , just , They have them right at the campsites ? Yeah , they 're , they 're lean-tos . Wow . Yeah , they 're pretty nice , they 're , they 're , uh , it 's like a little house except the whole face is open , and the one time that we went , we got one , it was overlooking the water but it was a big embankment , I wanted to get one right on the water . MUMBLEx we had an electrical storm too , and it was really , it was neat sitting there watching it , I mean , it was raining , when we called MUMBLEx home , everybody said , oh , we were worried about you in that storm ...
