Okay , what do you think are some current trends in , uh , the way families spend time together , based on what you 've seen . Um , I , I think that it 's getting to where they 're not spending time together . Yeah . Um , I think , uh , like in my situation , today , on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together , my husband 's been off doing his thing all day today , and I 've been off doing my thing all day and I have n't seen him since eight o'clock this morning . Really . So , uh . Are you newly married , or , Um , two years . Yeah . Same , same situation here , I 've been married about ten months , so . Yeah , I can , I can , I know what you mean . It 's , it 's really hard , hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and , uh , you both have hobbies that are different . Yeah . you know , if you have hobbies that are the same , then , you know , you can enjoy your hobby together , but my husband and I have different hobbies . Is he a hunter and a fisher and all that . No , no , he 's a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector . . That 's we , that 's wild . Um , so he was off today , uh , looking at , at records . Uh-huh . So , uh , and I was off , you know , doing , you know , hou- , household type things . Yeah . You know , laundry and , um , did some shopping and stuff . Um , from the people I 've talked to , I do n't know if I should bring this into it ,
