we 'll see . Pretty good trip . So what do you , what kind of hobbies are you in ? Well , I 'm mother of four , so basically I 'm just , real busy with my kids right now in sports , and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight , and , I substitute at the schools part-time . Oh , that 's great . Well , I am a travel agent at heart , and my hobby is just , I love traveling and , and being involved of that and finding out more , uh , but , it 's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband , so -- No , kidding . -- I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school , so I 've been librarian all this week , which has been real interesting , and I 'm enjoying it . I 'm around my kids That 's pretty easy substituting is n't it ? yeah , it 's great , it 's great , and what else do I do ,
