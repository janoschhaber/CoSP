And , uh , it 's just human nature to walk through an open door . So , and I would be glad to see that . I hope I do n't see a lot more single moms , but , MUMBLEx . i- , it seems in my experience I 'm running across single women all the time . I 'm , I 'm noticing that , too , and , and I notice the , the , a terming ex- , em , emerging called solo parents , Yeah . that I 'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that , that I encounter in the work place , and that , that is a little troublesome . Yeah , yeah . Uh , because the pressures on them are , are , It 's awful . rather , rather formidable . Yeah . Uh , and maybe that 's a change we 'll see . Maybe , uh , the possibility of , of women , uh , who deliberately say , no , we 'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps , Uh-huh . in the event of a separation or whatever . Right .
