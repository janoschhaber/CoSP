Yes . The reason I ask if you went to college is I thought , well , you know , what were your selection criteria . Did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or , you know , there 's all of these areas to look at in making the decision . Uh-huh . Those , and those were several , uh , that we did consider . Uh , my parents , uh , certainly did n't push but wanted me to look in the south and because I had been in a small school , they suggested that I probably , I , when I say small , my graduating class had eighteen in it . Oh , wow . And so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one-on-one -- Oh , definitely . -- uh , or small group situations . And I did pick it because at the time I was interested in majoring in biology and -- Uh-huh . -- I also wanted to spend one year studying in Europe . Uh , I had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year -- Oh , how exciting . -- and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing
