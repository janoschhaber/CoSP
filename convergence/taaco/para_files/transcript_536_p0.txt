So , uh , you know , my feeling is that , uh , it 's really being used today , it , it , you know , it , it really is n't doing any real good purpose for anything because it 's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal . Right , I think I 've seen some statistics that say that , uh , it 's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life . Right because y- , you , you 've got all , all the prison expenses , plus all the legal expenses . Right . Uh , and , you know , it certainly does n't seem to be a deterrent . Uh , for one thing because it 's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly do n't think the people that are committing the c- , crimes that would be eligible , you know , really care . Well , that 's , committing them mostly is , you know , either crimes of passion or at the moment or they think they 're not going to get caught or , Right , I mean , it 's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon , you know , I 'm invulnerable , I do n't need to care about this . You know , I , I , I 'm -- Yeah , b- , -- never going to get caught . Yeah , but you also have to think whether it 's worthwhile on the individual basis , for example , someone like , uh , Jeffrey Dahlmer , do you want , by putting him in prison for life , there is still a possibility that he will get out again . Yeah , one , one -- Whereas -- -- way or another . -- if you kill him , there is not that possibility . Yeah , but , but the other side to that is , if you put him in prison for life , there 's a chance that he might do things in prison , or , you know , and somehow redeem himself . Yeah , I do n't think he could ever redeem himself ,
