Regarding , uh , taxes . I , you know , taxes are really a necessary evil and , in a civilized society . But really , people get upset at taxes because you , it 's more efficient to do things yourself . Right . And , uh , and so as , as a result , uh , you know , it 's , it 's a trade-off , you know , for the common good , you know . For , for the benefit of others , you know . How much of your resource should you dedicate to , uh , making things work for others ? Have you , uh , you know , ever thought , you know , just how much of that money should , should go to other people that really do n't deserve it ? Uh , well yeah . I know it 's , it 's a lot , you know , that , uh , that I feel like , you know , just like you said , that , there 's just so much that you can do yourself . That you take care of your own self that you do n't need the money for but they 're giving it to other people that do n't really need it ei- , either , but yet they accept it . Well , the thing of it is , if I wanted to just , uh , you know , permanently become a book reader , I guess I could just , uh , you know , uh , go on public assistance , uh , you know -- Like so many people do . -- lo , lo , look for , uh , look for people to , uh , take care of me . Uh-huh . And , uh , probably a good woman , right ? Right .
