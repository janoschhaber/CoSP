Okay . Okay . Well , uh , do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote ? I think it 's somewhere really close to that cause I think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference . And they really do n't listen to any of the issues anymore . Huh . Because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked , you know ? Uh-huh .
