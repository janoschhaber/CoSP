and my , really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere . Oh , jeez . And so that was really the only experience that I 've had with guns and it , Right . it kind of scared me . Uh-huh . But I think that if I learn how to use one , I would , I would feel better . Right . I 've also always thought about the idea , you know , most sports , you know , which are the N R A and people have their thing , you know , if you ban guns , you 're just banning the , the recreation , the sport of hunting , things of that nature . Most of that 's done with rifles and such . Uh , though there 's , you know , probably I 'm sure some sector that does it with handguns . But just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns , would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous , you could n't be inconspicuous , Yeah . when you walked into a store stuff like that , you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately , you know , you- , if they had to have a rifle or was , you know , made it more difficult to get a , a , uh , a handgun . Now of course , you know , in this world anytime you 've freedom you can be able to get anything you want . Yeah , that 's true . But I guess to make it more difficult for the person who 's just so irate and upset and , you know , temporarily a little bit , uh , offset or off keel , I do n't know if that 's a large percentage of , uh , crime or not but I guess it would be some . But I , I think definitely , like today they just introduced the , what 's called the Brady bill . The seven day mandatory waiting period , Uh-huh .
