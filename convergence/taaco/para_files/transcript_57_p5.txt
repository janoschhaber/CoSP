Uh-huh . and , uh , it 's , well , it 's not that they came in , it 's they were conquered by the Germans , And then , and then the Russians even , just never given back . took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back , Yep . you know , so . That 's a , Well , that whole a , a little different situation . the whole i- , idea if you look at the Russian history and I guess all countries the way it used to be is , the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer . Uh-huh . And that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers and maybe , you know , more and more people are seeing , oh , countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer is n't going to help you , you can , well , I guess like , Yeah . with , uh , Israel is a perfect example . The reason they have the Angolan Heights and the , the , uh , all their buffer area is between Jordan and the , the Sinai and , and Lebanon was just as a buffer but , you know , as you can see with the , the scuds go right over there . Uh-huh . Yeah , they do n't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers . Yeah , there 's , there 's very little that , that binds you anymore in today 's technology . I knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany they said that 's the safest place in the world because if a war starts , all the bombs are going to go right over Germany and they 're going to land in other places , you know , that 's going to be the safest place to be .
