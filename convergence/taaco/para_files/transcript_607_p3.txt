Oh . Uh , I , you know , I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them but -- Uh-huh . -- I do n't think it 's as common as , uh , the newspapers would make you believe . Uh-huh . And another thing is cost . Oh , yeah . I mean that , I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now and they finding , in some cases they 're finding it 's just not worth it to work because it 's all going out in daycare . Right . Um . Well , in our case , we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were , uh , in school . And I 'm really happy we did it , although it was very , very difficult . And -- Um . -- I think it was the right thing to do and we were , uh , we just decided that we would do it and we went ahead but , uh , not everybody can make that choice and even , even though my wife was n't working , we did have , uh , one or another of the boys in , uh , child care for part-ti- , just for part of the day . Uh , or a couple of days a week just so that , uh , other things could get done around the house and so on , so , Huh . So , we did look around . I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not and , uh -- Huh . -- so I would always trust her judgment on that . Huh . Well I 'm just thanking heaven . My husband just got a new job . His last company , he was only working four days a week . Uh-huh . So it 's , and he just got a new job . He 's getting lots of overtime , he got a pay raise
