Okay , Eric . Uh , are you married and do you have a family ? Uh , yes I am to , uh , both questions . Okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances . Uh , yeah we do . We , uh , uh , basically there 's the , you know , the expenses that are fixed during the month -- Uh-huh . -- you know the ones that come every , every month and we , uh , enter those into , uh , into a spread sheet and , uh , whatever is left , uh , after that we , you know , we sit down and agree on kind of what , what sort of range we are going to -- Uh-huh . -- generally going to shoot for . I see . Uh , So what do you do ? Well , that 's basically what we do . Uh , about every , every three months or so , we re-evaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest -- Uh-huh . -- and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks . I work part time at night -- Wow . -- and he works , and my husband works full times days and so we have four checks , but that works out nice because we get paid every week and -- Yeah . -- so that does help , that helps a lot . And then , uh , we do n't have a lot ex , extra for extra spending , so it 's pretty well ear marked . Yeah . All allocated out . . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Every penny is ear marked but , uh it , we have found that works the best and and so if we can just divide them up , all the major bills up . In fact , we found it easier to divide the major bills up , you know , cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half ,
