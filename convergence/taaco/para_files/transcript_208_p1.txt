Um . What about yourself ? That 's pretty impressive . Uh , I guess I bicycle . Uh , the amount varies as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week . Uh-huh . Uh , I guess a play softball one night a week . And I backpack a lot over the summer . Oh , really ? Yeah , that 's , that 's about the extent of it . I mean , I do n't do any of those things particularly , you know , for exercise . But , uh , I guess the bicycling is the one thing I 'll sort of , like , do if I feel like I need to go exercise . Uh , but I do it mostly for fun . Yeah , uh , what do you ride , uh , like , a bunch of hills or pretty flat ? It , it , it varies . Uh , out near my house is pretty hilly . Uh , but sometimes I bike to work which is about , uh , a fifteen mile trip each way . And that 's mostly flat . How long does that take you to get to work ? Uh , about forty-five , fifty minutes . How d , how does that work , work out with , uh , storing your bike and showering and all that ? Yeah , it can be a pain . Uh , basically , uh , I work on a campus so I can store my bike in my office and walk across the , uh , campus to the , uh , gym , use the shower there -- Uh-huh . -- uh , but , it 's , it 's enough of a pain , that I did it consistently one year , I would commute every day , uh , but it just became such a pain .
