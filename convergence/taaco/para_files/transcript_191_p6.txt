I housesat from cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis , Uh-huh . and what we used to do was just put , um , newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter and then I would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing . Same idea . Then I would do it , you know , everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very , very rarely , Everyday ? and so it was n't so bad . Oh , okay , I see . MUMBLEx two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling , I would put just a little bit of cat litter in there , Uh-huh . because if I put a lot , one of the cats would have been , all of her animals that she ever had were adopted . Uh-huh . I that true , yeah . Yeah , she 's even got , she 's got one dog now and the two cats and her dog there is , is basically a reject , somebody had bought him , Uh-huh . and wanted him . It was her ex boyfriend and , you know , just was not mature enough to keep the dog , did n't realize how much work it was and now , Uh-huh . she 's stuck with it . And she 's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals but I think that for me , well , my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat . because that 's all there is to it . So , you know , So , you do n't have anything right now ? No , we do n't have anything right now .
