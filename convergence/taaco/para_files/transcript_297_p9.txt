 She 'll let something slip and we 'll say , wait a minute . And , and that 's it , she , just , well I did n't want to bother you . She ca n't accept that we want to be the care givers . Well , when she got home , who took care of her ? Yeah . Well , she stayed , she stayed in a temporary nursing home . Oh . Until she was okay . You know , it 's just , but it 's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her . She 's down in Temple -- Uh-huh . -- and we ca n't see her often enough to really know what 's going on . Um . So , it 's difficult , it really is and we 're all heading that way and , Yeah , my , husband and I , we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station and we 've pretty much planned that we 'll be here in the Dallas area and -- Uh-huh . -- there 's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they 're retired . So we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here . Yeah .
