Kay . Okay . I guess we 're talking about exercise , huh ? Yeah , yeah . Well first of all I , I ha , have to ask you how , how old you are ? Oh , I am twenty-seven . Twenty-seven , okay . Well , I am quite a bit older than you are . But , no . I think exercise is extremely important and I I do exercise on a regular basis . You do ? What type of exercise do you do ? Well , I do , uh , jazzercise -- Oh you do . -- which is an aerobic , uh , program that , are you familiar with it ? Yes . It 's , uh , you know , a national company and we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes like all day long so you can , Are they different from aerobics or is it the same thing ? No it 's really , it 's an aerobic routine . Yo- , you warm up and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting , you know , slowly and then working up to , uh , you know , a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again . And you do that every day or , No , I only do it probably two or three times a week . Oh , okay . The minimum they want you to do is three times a week . And this is a club or , uh , do you belong to a group ? Well , it 's really a I mean it 's called a center and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time and then you just go in whenever you can . So , like I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings . Do you go with friends or do you go alone ? No , I go by myself and that 's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me -- Yeah . -- and most of my friends that are my age do n't exercise or they might play tennis -- Uh-huh . -- and since I am not a tennis player , uh , you know , I do n't get that , but I am , you know , I am between , I am in my late forties -- Uh-huh . -- so , uh , there are n't many people , you know , that want to do that . Oh .
