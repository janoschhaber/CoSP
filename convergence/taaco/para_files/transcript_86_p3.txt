Sort of like the , uh , what is that , A B C 's NIGHTLINE . Uh-huh . Well , I guess they only normally stick with just the one , um , story . But they , they can do a much better job since they do n't have to chop it into little two minute stories . They do n't report on every murder and shooting that happened in , in every little town . No , no . It 's very much national interest news . Yeah . A lot of times they end up , um , with these panels of experts and they go back and forth , where everyone 's giving some opinions and sometimes that , I do n't know the value of that , because I saw plenty of jokes and , and , um , oh , editorial cartoons about all the retired generals , making a living during the , the Gulf War . I 've been getting a kick out of those lately . Uh-huh . Although , um . I- , I 'm only twenty-five , so I 've never actually been through a period of war -- Uh-huh . -- and I do n't know anyone in the military and I do n't have a lot of background knowledge in , uh , military strategy and , and weaponry , and , and all that kind of stuff . And I thought the generals were very interesting . Now when they started to speculate , I , I saw that for what is was , Uh-huh . and thought all of these guys do n't know what 's going on . But I thought the- , the- , they were interesting , and , and they shed some light on what was going on for me . I will admit it 's interesting . I- , I- , I 'm twenty-six . So I do n't have any more experience in that than you .
