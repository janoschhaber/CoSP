to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts . Right . Oh , I was thinking about , you know , like the , uh , the Styrofoam used at , uh , the fast-food restaurants , Yeah . that if everybody , uh , and so , yeah , I know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of Styrofoam but , uh , Now we quit that about two years ago , no , three years ago when we got china mugs for everybody . Huh . So , and the only difficulty with that is that we 're in the middle of a five-year drought and so i- , it 's a real difficult choice whether we want Styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or , uh , china cups to use up our water . But at the moment we 're using the china cups , and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year , and then , uh , you 're supposed to keep it recycled every day . Well , that 's good . That 's a , Yeah . they should last awhile . Well , let us hope that everybody 's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get , uh , better reuse of things because , I believe we are . I h- , I have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening . Yep . And so it will , it will be good , It sure will . in the long run . Well , I enjoyed it . Well , good to talk ,
