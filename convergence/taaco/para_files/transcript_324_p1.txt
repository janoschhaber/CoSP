And I , so I mean , how I would go about doing it is I would just call all my relatives . Uh-huh . Because I , since I came from , my father has , uh , five sisters and two brothers and my mother has four brothers and two sisters . So I ca- , both of my parents had big families , and we always wer- , we always got together , just always . Now it 's different because I live here and I , you know , when I go home I try to see the families , as much of the family as I can but -- Yes . -- it 's real different . And I grew up in a real not , I think not normal setting . With all of you living so close together . Right . I mean Sunday dinner was at my grandmother 's and , you know , like I said there would be thirty , you know , thirty people , and everyone would just bring things
