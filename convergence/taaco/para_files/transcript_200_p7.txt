well , hoses were being used , Uh-huh . and , uh , uh , soaker hoses , made out of old tires . Yeah . What else , something else was made out of old tires , I was trying to remember what it was . Oh , I ca n't think of it now . But I was , I was trying to get my , uh , kids , you know , to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes . Uh-huh . And just anything , to , you know , recycle rather than keep throwing it away , but my biggest problem is , I take the bags out of the store , buy the bags to bring the back , and then I forget to bring them in the store . Yeah . I 'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out . I wish they 'd really push this recycling bit , because I never realized , I really did n't realize how much stuff I actually throw away . Well , I think the , the more people are aware of it , the , the more they 'll do . I think that 's just the biggest problem is keeping it in , in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is , and how important it is to do that . You know what I 'd like to see a little more . I do n't have any little tiny kids , Uh-huh .
