Okay , so , um , how do think , how do you think we 've changed in the last ten to twenty years ? Uh , I 'm at a little bit of a loss , you know , I do n't know , ten years ago , see I 'm what , I 'm about , uh , twenty-eight now so -- Uh-huh . -- when I was eighteen , things have n't changed a whole lot . Really . People are being a little more , oh , I do n't know , a little le- , a little less bigoted in some ways , I do n't know -- Uh-huh . -- seems to me . Well , I guess I 'm like my parents . The younger generation gets away with hell , but , uh , Yeah . Well , it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted but that may just be because I 've changed . You know , I used to live up north . Down here , Dallas , seems to me , the police are militant -- Really . -- but , uh , Where 'd you live up , where 'd you live at , I lived in Akron , Ohio . Oh , did you ? I 'm from MUMBLEx , Illinois , so . Oh . How long , how long you been in Dallas ? Oh , about eight years . Oh , really ? In fact in the eight years I 've been here it seems to me it gets more and more , gets to be more and more restrictive place to live . Yeah , uh -- I think , -- you know , uh , as you 're talking like police and stuff like that it 's definitely a tough job to do . Yeah , I think it 's , crime has gone , got a lot worse in the last -- Oh , yeah , I agree .
