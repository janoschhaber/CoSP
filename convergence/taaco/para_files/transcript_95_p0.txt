Well , what d , do you think in terms of , uh , benefits ? Well , personally , you know , I think , you know , of course I 'm sure we 're familiar with the exact same benefit package and I think that , uh , we 've probably got one of the best around , you know , besides , they tend to offer ad , adequate vacation , I guess . And the paid time off is wonderful , and , uh , one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered and I think that is just a , a fabulous one , so . I do n't know if you participate in that or not , but -- Absolutely . -- is n't it great ? It 's just a , it 's just a miracle that how fast that adds up , you know . Well , I have to agree with that . You know , I was thinking about , uh , importance of benefits and that kind of thing , other than salary -- Uh-huh -- while I was waiting for , uh , the system to find a , a respondent . Uh-huh . And I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and I suspect that that 's probably true for everyone . Yeah . When I was much younger it was , uh , less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits . But as I grow older and my family grows , it , the medical benefits are more important and the retirement is more important . I had never really thought of it that way but I guess that 's true , I guess that 's true . I 'm still young enough that , that , uh , the vacation 's real important to me and the paid time off is real important to me and , and that kind of thing . But , uh , you know , I was just , as a matter of fact , I just , uh , celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and , uh , kind of started looking through the , the book because of that , you know , now that I 'm a hundred percent vested , you know , you kind of look through the book and see well , what exactly , what does that mean and what is the pension all about and , you know , when you 're , when you 're , you know , in your , I 'm only in my late twenties now , so you tend not to think about retirement . But , uh , it 's , I guess now is the time to think about it , so . Does T I have a pretty good retirement package , do you think ? I think they have , uh , a- , one that we need to recognize that we 're going to have to supplement ourselves .
