We do n't get to go that often , but something on the tip of my tongue , and I ca n't think of which one it was . Uh . Gosh , I ca n't remember . The last , uh , in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw -- Uh-huh . -- I said that wrong , the last movie I saw was THE HARD WAY with Michael J . Fox . But that , that sounds good . Well , that really was n't too bad . There were , you know , he 's supposed , you know , he 's this actor , right -- Uh-huh . -- and he 's playing a cop . Right . Or he 's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff . I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop . Oh , okay . I mean , there , there were times when he was , like , he 'd be running with a gun or whatever .
