I was going to pick up my daughter . But , anyway , it was , uh , the , it , it 's interesting , though , or did he just do it ? I think that , I think he really , his heart was in it , but I , I do n't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was . I think it was something that he really wanted to do . He wanted to direct it , he wanted to , to star in it . You know , he , he enjoyed the story line and I think he just really w , he really wanted it . And whether it , whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office , I think he would have been happy . Because I think that , I think he did a good job and , and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him . Do you know who the guy was that was playing the , uh , the , the wagon driver ?
