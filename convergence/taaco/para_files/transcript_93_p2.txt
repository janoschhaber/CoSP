I says , you go pay to have someone do it . Yeah . Because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something . I guess as far north as you are if you like gardening , you 've still got a couple months to go , have n't you ? Oh , yeah . Um , well , right now we , um , start our seeds inside . Uh-huh .
