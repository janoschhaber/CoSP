I can see that would be , uh , easy . They make it as easy as they possibly can for you . Oh , yeah . Well , um , do a lot of people take advantage of it ? Quite a few do . They have probably , ooh , I 'd say fifteen different , fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running , and they have them anywhere from six in the morning . Uh , they have some during , during lunch hour that are shorter , and I guess guys can take advantage of that . For me , I would n't have time to do an hour , hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get , get dressed again . Oh , yeah . But there 's a lot more guys that do that one . Uh-huh . And , um , they have them , you know , in the evenings , they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that . So they have big variety . They even have some , uh , aerobic , uh , water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool . I 've never done that one before . But . Oh , you have a pool there , too ? Uh-huh . Oh , how nice . They 've got an olympic pool , and , and basketball courts and sand volleyball . They 've got the full weight room and , uh , the locker rooms with , uh , a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities , and hair dryers , and all the , you know , everything you 'd need just about . Wow . It 's a real , it is a real nice facility . It 's also got a full insid , inside basketball court , and I think they 're working on building a jogging track and some other things . But it 's , it is very nice .
