And , my face hurt so bad , from laughing -- Oh . -- because I love Billy Crystal . And course , growing up on , on the back of a horse , you know , and being on ranches and stuff , so much of that was so true and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles . It was so funny . Both of them were great . Oh , well good . I 'm , I 'm glad to hear that because they , Oh , they are , are we just laughed so hard . And like I said , with CITY SLICK- , I mean with SOAPDISH , it is so cornball and it is so overacted that you 're just hysterical -- Uh-huh . -- you know . Just , they just carried it off , to the tee . Well , I do n't , I do n't know if you got to see WEEKEND , um , AT BERNIE 'S -- No . -- that was out a couple of years ago . They had a free showing at the Berkeley , um , United Artist . How neat . And , I do n't know who was here or whether Jay called a friend and we did n't think we 'd have much chance of getting in but we thought we 'd try it , you know , free movie . Shoot , yeah . It was so funny and it sounds like , uh , what you were just describing , SOAPDISH , too . I mean , we just , we hurt by the time we came out . Oh yeah . And the whole theater was hysterical and it 's just , it 's just goofy . I mean , it 's , uh , if you have a chance to rent it , at least , or it should be out on T V , I would think , Yeah , I think it is . I think it is . Um , cause it 's , it 's just a fun summer light comedy , make your cheeks hurt laughing . Especially in the theater it was contagious , you know -- Yeah . -- I , I imagine the way SOAPDISH was , but , with -- Oh gosh -- -- everyone laughing . -- I never laughed . And people were just screaming and applauding and , you know , it was just hysterical . Well , I 'm glad you did that before your surgery . Oh , me too , because I do n't even know if I could live through it now . Yeah .
