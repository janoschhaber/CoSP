no let 's see , the one that they have the , the whole opera singing in the background . Oh ! Bo , Bo , Bohemian Rhapsody . Right , right , yeah , yeah . Yeah , that , that was great . I heard that the other day on the radio and I pumped it up . Because , I mean , I just love that song . Yeah , that , that was a real good one . Yeah , but they had , that , that whole record was pretty good . But then , they started going downhill like everybody else . Well , that 's true . They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that . Yeah , they 're , they 're still around , they 've got a ne , new C D out , but I , I would n't buy it . Because see , what happens is , the old , see whe- , I like , I like the old Rolling Stones . I do n't like the new stuff . Of the Stones ? Yeah . Yeah . I agree . That 's the ne- , the older stuff is the best of it . The , the new stuff 's kind of more like , today 's rock and roll , which I , Yeah . do n't really care for today 's rock and roll too much . Well , for example , I used to like old Phil Collins . Right . Yes , definitely . I agree . And , and , then what happened was that Phil Collins said , hey I can make money , a lot of money doing this , and then he came out with , uh , see , for example , his , his record like , No Jacket Required . Uh-huh . That was good , but it was on his way of going downhill , because he said , I can make a lot of money just singing alone , and then he came out with the Invisible Touch , with , uh , Genesis and that really , like now , I hate Phil Collins , I ca n't stand him . Right . Because , I look at him and I say , you know , you were singing at this time , and with these people , and you were great ,
