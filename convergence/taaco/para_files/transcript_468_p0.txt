Okay , uh , what kind of hobbies do you have Lori ? Uh , I guess , I , uh , I like to play golf . Uh-huh . And , uh , I also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts . Uh-huh . Where do you play golf in this area ? Well , we live , uh , pretty close , to the Mesquite Golf Course . Uh-huh . So , we will play either out there or at Firewheel . That is usually where we play , but I have played you know different courses in in the Dallas area . Do you , uh , do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf ? Uh , both . Oh . Not at the same time . I was going to say , that could be difficult . No , sometimes we ride and sometimes , uh , we , pull , we like to , to , uh , a lot of the times just walk , uh , for the exercise . But -- Uh-huh . -- I find that when I ride in a cart , I play better and I think it is cause I do n't get as tired .
