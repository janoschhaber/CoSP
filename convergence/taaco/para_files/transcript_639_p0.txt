Uh , around here we have a program where , uh , we , we put out the , the , we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers . And we keep the newspapers in a , in a , they 're collected twice a month and the trash and , and this bottled stuff that is put in a , in a little blue bin that 's picked up and sorted out into a truck . So they ma- , actually have about three passes at this collection . One for -- Sounds , -- the regular trash , one for the , uh , uh , you know , the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers . But I gather you do not separate , uh , the bottles and cans . No , they , they do that on the truck . Uh-huh . They separate them as they , as they , you know , dump them . And , you know , one guy comes around with his truck and , and dumps it all in there . And I think they 're , they 're running out of , uh , you know , MUMBLEx . The sanitary landfill , I think , uh , is , you know , running out . Of course , uh , you being from New Mexico , you 've probably been n- , to Washington . Especially if you 're , your present location . Yes . You must have come to Washington at least once . Yes , I know . Not only have I come to Washington but , uh , I find it very amusing that , uh , the thing that was just instituted here is very similar . That is we also have blue bins . We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and , uh , landfill space is , in deed , the driving factor here . And , in fact , uh , despite all of our open space out here , landfill space is still , uh , very hard to come by . My , you 've got a lot a , a lot of nothing out there . A- , You know , they got , I mean there , there 's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could , you could use for landfill . MUMBLEx .
