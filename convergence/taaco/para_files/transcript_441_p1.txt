And , uh , see the , the , the state has a law that says you can not borrow the money to build your own home . R- , is that so ? I did n't know that . You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you ca n't borrow the money to build your own . Well that sounds kind of dumb . Well , it 's to protect the , the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home -- Uh-huh . -- and then it does n't sell and then the bank 's -- Yeah . -- holding the bag . Yeah . Well . Huh . As , as you know , anything that involves the government is , works half as well as it 's supposed to costs three times as much . Right ? That 's right . Hence the savings and loan problem we have . Yeah , that 's true . But , uh , you know , my home is , uh , fairly simple . It 's designed to be added on to . Uh-huh . That 's good . Yeah . Well , I figure it 's just me and my wife but , you know , I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot , so I want -- Yeah . -- to have a shop . How big a lot do you got it on ? Ten acres . Wow . That 's nice . That 's real nice . Well , yeah . It 's really nice too because I ca n't see my nearest neighbor . He 's on the other side of a hill . Oh . And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon . Seriously . God . That 's pretty good . Well , in the winter time , I can see , see another guy but , you know , he 's -- Uh-huh . -- I can just make out his place , you know . Yeah . I 've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north . Yeah . And , uh , Oh , that 's pretty good .
