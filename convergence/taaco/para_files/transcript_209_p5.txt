he 's , he 's just about a year old himself and never had really , I do n't think he 'd swum before . Really . But he jumped in , in the , the river . Did puppy go to ? Well the puppy jumped in the , into some of the pools but not into the , I was careful to keep her away from the , Oh , that 's good , yeah . the fast moving water , 'cause if she fell in then I 'd of been , had to go in after her . And up here the water 's probably about forty degrees right now . Ugh , ugh . And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her , but , uh , this dog , Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now , as he 's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and , uh , actually paddled up against the current and , uh , made it back to the shore and climbed up and then , he , he jumped in again , and he was swimming for quite a bit , all afternoon . He loved it . Yeah , Cocoa did n't think too much of it , though . She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out . I pulled her out and , uh , then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad , Yeah . and so , but , uh , she got over it , so . Well the German Shepherd that I had before , we , we had a little pool , Uh-huh . and , uh , she was , she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to , to get in the pool on the first step . She 'd just get on the first step and lay down . Uh-huh . You know in the summertime when it 's really , really hot . Yeah . And she 'd just lay there on that step and just , you know , cool off . Yeah ,
