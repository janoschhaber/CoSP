What , what , how do you get your main source of current events ? Well , uh , until recently I was taking the WALL STREET JOURNAL , and I thought that was a good way , but I have about five different magazines that I get that keeps me up on things . You know , it 's a week or two late , but , uh , that 's how I 'm staying up . I either watch the news or , or occasionally I 'll read the paper .
