That , well it can be . It , it really kind of depends on , on , um , what they were , you know , what they were looking for . In other words , if , if in Spring cra- , training they were looking at all their kids , like a lot of them do , um , then it really does n't give you any indication . But if they were , uh , playing the people that they 're going to play , then that might be pretty good indication , so , you know , it 's , it 's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just , you know , come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring crani- , training and then gone on a , you know , fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so , You know what I think is remarkable is , uh , it seems that what you really need to do to win though , is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have , have , have real breakthrough years . Exactly , yeah . And , and the question is how do you forecast that , You ca n't . if you had to , if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series , I mean it would be really tough . Right , th- , I think the best thing that you can do is go with , um , the players that are , that have the talent to do the best years . And , um , that they had n't had these , uh , gigantic , uh , career years yet and , Yeah . and just kind of assume that , you know , so- , one of them is going to break through eventually , so . And I , I think they said the Reds , um , this last year , I 'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years . Yeah . You know , and , and so they may be even be , better this year . Well , well when are the Rangers going to come through th- , Uh , that 's a good question . I , the Rangers have a , have a pitching problem
