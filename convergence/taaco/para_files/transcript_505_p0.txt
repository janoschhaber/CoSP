Right . While I 'm at work sometimes , I , on the computer network -- Uh-huh . -- um , I read the news sometimes , and that 's kind of helpful .

That 's true , I mean , my roommates and stuff , you know -- Yeah . -- people around me talk about it . And the people I work with are pretty , you know , up , up-to-date on that kind of stuff , so . Right . Well , I 'm a housewife , I have three kids , and so -- Uh-huh . -- um , I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock -- Yeah . -- and then , um , talking with people and just hearing what 's going on . MUMBLEx . Do you watch , do you watch the network , like major network news , or do you watch like -- Just the regular channel -- -- the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR ? -- just channel eight . Oh , really . That 's our channel here that 's the , um , eyewitness news . Uh-huh . So . Oh , ch- , see channel , where I am channel eight 's , um , like public T V , so it 's kind of different . Oh , uh-huh . Yeah .
