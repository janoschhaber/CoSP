Uh , usually have them come from MUMBLEx you know , projects to collect old ones . Usually just get dumped out with the trash . And phone books are a large volume of annual trash . Yeah . They , they just , matter of fact , that , that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa- , the local schools , you could send your phone book to your , uh , to , with your kid to school and what they 'll do is they 'll recycle it . Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that , uh , trash , uh , the telephone books are the type of thing that do n't break down over a long period of time . A guy went to a d- , a landfill , dug down five feet and , and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty because they do n't , they do n't degrade over such a period of time . Well , part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper .
