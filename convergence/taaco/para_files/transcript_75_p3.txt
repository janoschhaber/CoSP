Yes , as a matter of fact , I heard the weather the other day on T V and I think it was one day this week a year ago -- Uh-huh . -- they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather . You know -- Right . -- it was n't just a super bad storm , but it was -- Right . -- it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the , the late spring time . Yeah . One of the weirdest things I saw , I think it was around this time last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm . Oh , wow . I , you know , I was going into the grocery store , and a , a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead , and it was twenty- six degrees out . Um . And I thought , Well gee , I 've , I 've never known it to lightening at that temperature . Yeah , that , that is pretty unusual . And you really take notice of it , too . That 's right . It , uh , it probably was a lot warmer up high . Sometimes they get those inversions , like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing . The air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees . Um . The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and could n't get away . Wow . I do n't , do n't like that super cold stuff . Nope . I just do n't move very well when it 's that cold .
