I , uh , I just moved down , in fact , from South Dakota in , in June , and that 's when the movie was filmed , Uh-huh . and , uh , we , when , when the movie came out , we went , uh , my dad lives in the state capital , which is Pierre -- Uh-huh . -- and it was filmed right outside of Pierre . In fact , the buffalo , the scene , the big buffalo herd scene , that was , that was a live scene . Wow . Uh , there 's a guy that has got a , a buffalo farm , and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and , and , uh , we , my dad has got a little plane , we flew over it all a- , looked at the buffalo , it was really neat . But , uh , so we are watching the , the movie in the movie theater in Pierre -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , just every time I would start to get into the movie , and it was getting good -- Uh-huh . -- someone in the crowd would yell , hey , there 's John Red Eagle , you know or , you know , they 'd start recognizing people . They knew , they knew the extras or the , Yeah . So , I kind of , I think I enjoyed it more when I , when I watched it on video cassette than I did , uh , in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they 'd say that . I 'd go now , now which one could that be -- Uh-huh . -- you know , and I 'd , I 'd start trying to focus in on people instead of , of picking up the overall , Scope . Right . Exactly . Uh-huh . So , but I , I thought it was a good film . But you are right , I think , I think it was very one sided . It , it was , but it 's a side that has n't been told . Uh , as far as , you know , telling it from , you know , the Indians as the good guys and the , the white men as the bad guys . I , I really thought about , uh , all the , the westerns that we have seen for years and years , Sure . and it 's just , shoot the Indians , and they are always the savages . Right .
