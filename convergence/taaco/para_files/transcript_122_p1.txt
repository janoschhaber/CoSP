I 've been called , but I had to beg off from the duty . And you ? Well , I was called and then I was not chosen . Um . Well , I was , I was , uh , originally chosen primarily , I think , because I was a young fellow and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict . I do n't know why . Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago . Oh , really ? Yeah , it 's that the younger they are , they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason , and they kind of liked me . I looked conser , and all that stuff and they , I do n't know what they saw in me , but they saw it . But , uh , back to the issue , is , uh , I do n't know , at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted , especially in cases in which there 's no smoking gun . But , there , too , there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable , particularly , I think in civil cases . In criminal cases , I 'd like to see the unani- , unanimity remain , but in civil cases , I think a majority rule by , by jury would be sufficient . Well , uh , could you give me an example of a case where you think that ? Well , in a criminal case , say one in which , you know , there is , like , say assault or some such . I think there ought to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this .
