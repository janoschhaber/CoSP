I think the taxes have just , every time you turn around they , they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products , and I , I , I think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now . Well , I , I tell you , um , I remember every time , it seems like , we turned around , they 're adding another nickel or -- That 's right . -- a few more cents onto the price of gasoline . That 's right . And actually , that one , the , the , the taxes on gasoline do n't , do n't bug me as much as , uh , uh , what are we , eight and a quarter percent sales tax ? Yep , that 's right . And every time you go to buy anything now , uh , even , you know , they , they tax food . That 's the one that really kind of bothers me . Well , I think that , uh , that the problem with the sales tax , of course , is it 's an unfair tax across the board , uh , as far as ability to pay , which a- , allegedly , allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards . But , uh , now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of , you know , taxes on everything they buy , and where people that make , you know , two hundred , three hundred thousand dollars a year , certainly a portion of that , they are n't going to be paying taxes on , you know . And , uh , that 's the unfair equity , inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue , but I do n't think it is anymore , not in Texas anyway . Oh , I got you , because people that , uh , do n't make very much money wind up spending it all . That 's right , that 's right .
