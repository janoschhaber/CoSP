That 's true . I have , I have a real issue with that . Um , I think that if from every year when they , when they pull in the , the , the , uh , test that the last three years , you know , ten , eleven , twelve year , uh , graders take , and , and then you see that their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states . They 're not saying that something 's wrong with the educational system here in Texas , I have a real concern about that , um , as a matter of fact I 'm very content to spend my daughter out of state to college in Virginia , Uh-huh . uh , verses having her go down here and not learn anything , and then , uh , so I 'm , MUMBLEx my opinion I think there 's a big concern hope , hopefully the new , uh , education , secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but , uh , I do n't know , they 've got to quit worrying about , uh , the , uh , religious , uh , overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product . Yeah , I think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people , you know , special interest groups can blow up , Uh-huh . and , uh , and not really get down to teaching what 's important . Teaching these kids , you know , how MUMBLEx really the basics is what it comes down to . Exactly . I was astonished to find out that , that across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed . Is that right ?
