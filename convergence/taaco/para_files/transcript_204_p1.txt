why not an apprentice out to a , a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or , you know , just a technician ? You can learn on the job . Uh-huh . Which , of course , again , which m , would mean , again , our education budget will go down if this is , in a few years , I mean it 's not going to be overnight . Yeah . But that would come down . I think the pro- , you know , that 's one reason , uh , you know , we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board . Uh , they 're not willing to , you know , to put that , you know , the training for only a certain amount . So , uh , it 's , you know , as far as the technical side . But , uh , even like one , one of the biggest things now is like paralegals and stuff . I mean they , they 're trying to get more people into that field . But they ca n't just bring somebody in without even having gone to , you know , school in that area before they can work , you know , for a lawyer as a paralegal . Excuse me . I see it being done . I know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever
