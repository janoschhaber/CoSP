Okay , well , I can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows -- Okay . -- and they kind of are in different spectrums , I think . Um , one of them is QUANTUM LEAP -- Okay . -- and the other one is NIGHT COURT . And I think , I think they 're real different , I mean , I do n't think they have anything in common , um , QUANTUM , LEAP has , I mean QUANTUM LEAP is kind of a comedy in its own way , I guess , but , uh , mostly it 's , it 's kind of science fiction , and , it 's , um , it 's adventure and things like that -- Uh-huh . -- and then NIGHT COURT is just pure , you know , weird fun , you know , just , it 's , it 's nothing serious about it at all . So , I do n't know why the two of them happen , to be my two favorite shows , but they , that 's the way it is , so . It 's funny that those are my two , my husband 's two favorite shows , too , and I enjoy both , watching both of them , but I used to did n't like NIGHT COURT -- Uh-huh . -- and I , and the only reason I think I like it now is because I 've seen it so much and I 'm involved with the characters , but , I used to think , um , Dan Fielding was just too , too vulgar and too crude for me . He is . And I told my husband , that 's the whole point , but -- Yeah , that 's right , I mean , -- I , I just , it 's , I find him degrading at times . I guess that is the point , but sometimes it just , Well , they , they really have changed him though . If , If you 've watched it this season , um , he 's becoming , I mean , he still is in his own way degrading and everything , but , uh , he 's involved in that charity ,
