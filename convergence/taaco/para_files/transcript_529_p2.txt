Okay , ready ? Yep . Okay . So , so you think , uh , I think that a short work week is real nice . Uh , I have a thirty-seven hour work week . How about you ? Well , well right now , I , I 'm just a student . I only work part time , but I 've work in the job force before -- Uh-huh . -- and forty hours is just too long . You just do n't have any time to do anything . It seems like , Saturday you get get off , but Sunday you 're getting ready for Monday . And if we get have a -- Uh-huh . -- if we could have a thirty-two hour work week , with that happen is that , for every four people we could give another job . Right . And then that way everybody would have a three day holiday , okay . And that way that more , that would make a bigger market . We 'd have , uh , more recreation . People would have time to do it . There would be less of a stress level . We 'd have , we 'd have less crime . We 'd have to we 'd have to build less prisons , you know , less police force . Yeah , it all makes sense to me . Although , there may be more crime . I mean if people have more leisure time . It 's not clear . And that , It , it , that 's , that 's a possibility . Yeah . One , one of the problems they 're facing now , a lot of people now , is that the health insurance is that the small business ca n't , ca n't offer health insurance -- Uh-huh . -- and it , it 's too costly and what , what is happening is that they 're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it , okay . So they get a specific rate .
