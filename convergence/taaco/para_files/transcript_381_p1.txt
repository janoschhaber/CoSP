And we did not know in August to put down the , uh , whatever it is for grub worms . Uh-huh . And the next spring , I guess in that March , every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed , we 'd have big whole patches come up . Have you ever seen it -- Yeah . -- what grub worms do ? Yeah . And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it , it would just come off in the rake , down to the dirt . So we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything . It took a lot of money and a lot of time , so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazinon . Yeah , you , you think that 's what it was , huh . Oh , yeah , we found them -- Okay . -- yeah we found them . We dug under there about an inch and you could see them . They 're real fat little white things , and -- Yeah . -- they said they turn into black bugs in the spring -- Yeah , those kind of brown , uh , Ju- , -- yeah , but in , but in the , What we call June bugs -- Uh-huh .
