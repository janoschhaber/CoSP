Have to agree with you , and I 'm kind of i- , in favor of capital punishment also . I just do n't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because , uh , you still see them committing the same crimes , but , I tend to agree with you that , uh , we should have it . I just , I do n't know that it 's always effective , but I guess we , uh , we 're kind of stuck with it . It 's , it 's a difficult , uh , problem , is n't it , to determine how you 're going to punish somebody for a particular crime , uh , But , then , you know , I think that , that some murderers do n't really warrant capital punishment . Uh-huh . You know , just , like , for example , uh , you know , you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands -- Uh-huh . -- who abused them -- Right , uh-huh . -- and I do n't think , that would really warrant capital punishment . Uh-huh , huh . Do you think they should be punished at all , or , uh , like go to prison , uh , because they 're not really a danger to society . It was almost really self defense , is n't it , in a case like that . Uh , it is to a certain extent -- Uh-huh . -- but I think , I do n't know because , I know they put , uh , put them in jail sometimes , I guess . Uh , I think in s- , and it , just would depend upon the circumstances -- Uh-huh . -- and , and the extent of the abuse -- Uh-huh .
