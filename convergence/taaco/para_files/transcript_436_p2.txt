I , I do n't know , I think they 're a little bit biased sometimes . Like for example , the Kennedy , the Kennedy rape case . The coverage on that was , you know , when it first happened it was , he was guilty , he was guilty , he was guilty . You know , they try to have you form opinions or whatever , and then I , I did n't like the thi- , the things that were going on when we had Desert Storm and stuff like that . You know , basically I , I , I think they do n't present the , the whole sides of , of everything . So , it , it makes you feel like they 're , uh , wanting you to take their opinion . Right . It 's , it 's , it 's , instead of reporting the news , it 's more like an editorial , I believe -- Yeah . -- on a lot of issues . I 've noticed that too , and it 's kind of distressing , is n't it ? Yeah .
