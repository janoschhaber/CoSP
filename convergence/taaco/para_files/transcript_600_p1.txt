Uh , it seems to me that the judge does it and I , I think that 's probably all right in that they , you know , maybe know what the , the norm is -- Uh-huh . -- for a particular thing . And , I guess , also what the system will absorb . Right . Probably more tuned in to that . Possibly though on , uh , capital cases like maybe the death penalty --
