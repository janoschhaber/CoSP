You want to go first ? . No , you can start . Okay . Uh , one of the things they talked about was , uh , did we , d- , wh- , what do we think about a judge making the decision ? Uh-huh . And I really do n't agree with that . I think that the trial by jury is better , uh , you know , than e- , having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible . I do n't think that they could be objective in every case , every time . Right . Yo- , you know what I mean ? Right . There 's , there , th- , this topic is kind of mute . Uh -- Yeah . -- there , there 's no way . We , we could n't survive in a sy- , in a juror syst- , in a trial system without a jury . Right . Uh , one man can never be , one man , one woman can never be objectionable in every case . That 's it . Uh , every person has their opinions and that 's why jury selection is often very difficult . Uh . Well , I , I feel the other thing too , uh , they were saying , uh , you know , what new ways could y- , could it , you , you know , change the system . I , I really think that , uh , we spend a lot of time , uh , going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal , I mean , i- , if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed . If they have been caught , you know , point blank in the crime . Right . There 's , uh , no question it 's beyond a reasonable doubt . You know , all these things . I mean , you know , we 've gone through this over and over again . Right . They should n't allow an appeal . And it can go on for ten , twenty , years . Yep . I , I think this is a little ridiculous . Uh-huh . I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers .
