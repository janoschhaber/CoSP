I mean , when you listen to it , it 's um , uh , I think that they do n't use , elec , some of it , it 's , they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably , Uh-huh . so , you know , well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now , and from West Africa , that 's considered world music , because it 's not particularly using certain types of folk styles . Right . But , they 're , they 're trying to make it somewhat more modern . I , I , I , a good , another good example was I heard Miles Davis , and Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar , Uh-huh . if you can believe it , I mean , Uh-huh . You know , he 's a jazz performer , and then he 's playing with Robbie Shoncar , who 's a very good , he 's a very good arranger . Uh , arrangement to , uh , we 're going to have to get off . The , are they trying to MUMBLEx , I do n't know . But , uh , MUMBLEx We 've talked our five minutes though . Yeah , okay , but , I mean , when I heard his album , I heard it and it was just incredible . I 've been listening to that a lot lately . Yeah , I , I listened and , I heard , you know , you hear this guitar , and then you hear the muted trumpet . I me , and you never would think that they , that they can actually play together but , Oh yeah .
