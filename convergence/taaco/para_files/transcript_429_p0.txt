Okay , what do you think about , uh , the self insurance business ? Well , I watched something on T V a couple of months ago by , uh , General , ex , uh , Surgeon General Koop . Uh-huh . And he talked about Canada 's system and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that , but the expensive stuff , heart , uh , operations and things , they have a managed scarcity .

Uh-huh . Uh , I think they 're asking for it .
