I think that 's kind of when my husband hit the roof , Really . because it was a , uh , thirteen thousand dollar bill , but after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work , Yeah . and that was when they had , God it would have been the eighty-five layoff , Yeah . and I 'll tell you how they handled this and I was just outraged , I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been , uh , terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months later and they did n't have any coverage under my name and I went back and I said what the hell is going on here , you know . Yeah , really . And they told me that , uh , oh , well , you know , you know , your husband works here and he 's got a good salary we did n't think that you 'd be coming back anyway , and , uh , you know , we 've got people here that really , you know , need to be working and so that we had just , you know , it was , this way we did n't have to layoff an active person and we 'd just let you go . And it took me about a year of arguing , I said , you know , I 've got to put this in writing to me , Yeah . and because until they put it in writing , I could n't get my insurance benefits and I could n't get my , uh , termination benefits either . There you go . I was just pissed as hell that they could do that . I , I can believe that . But I , I guess things have gotten better , I 've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things , Oh , yeah , flex time is great .
