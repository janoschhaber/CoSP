We have like Carolina , and Duke , and Georgia Tech , and N C State , teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty . Uh-huh . So , hopefully we 'll have a good year . I do n't really follow the N B A very closely . And see that 's probably all , all I saw . I , we have moved in the last couple years from Utah to Texas and there 's so many colleges and universities in Texas , we have n't really followed them too much and none of them are our , our alma mater so , that seems to help . Do you like professional basketball ? Uh , I , I follow it especially around the playoffs , so , course , I was real familiar with the Utah Jazz , and the Mailman or Karl Malone was , you know , pretty big thing and , the Lakers have always been amazing to watch . Yeah . I , I did keep track a little bit of the Mavericks . They 've not had any good seasons for a long time , and have a lot of problems with , with Tarpley and , maybe now that that 's over they 'll , they 'll come out of it but , Well , that 's an up and coming team , though . Yeah , I hope they do something . They need to or they 're not going to have any of the team left at all .
