I could n't put in enough overtime that was necess , or that , you know , things that would come up at work , that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays -- Uh-huh . -- as is , you know , as is needed , because my husband for a long time was out of the country -- Oh , yeah , -- also with , uh , with work , for like three months and , So it was you and the kid and your work schedule is . Yeah . Well that 's the thing , see , you know , maybe if you get along for example if you 'd been a technician instead of an engineer . You know , the technicians work the eight to five job -- Yeah , might have been better . -- and know when they 're going to be there . Yeah . But if you 're going to be more professional oriented , then you 've got to have this , to be able to perform well on the job you 've got to have the flexibility that does n't really go with the family . Yeah , and so it was , in my case , I just , uh , decided that , as long as my kids were little , I would be better off at home with them , instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once .
