Oh , yeah . My nickname for her is Honey Woman . That 's what I call her . Really . Well that sounds fun . Well , I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago , and there were , we sent out five hundred , uh , announcements , because our family is quite large , like your , your family there . And so that was a real challenge , and I was president of our family reunion for two years , and I was n't very MUMBLEx at that duty , for two years in a row , but I found that advance planning was the key to success . Uh , also one thing that 's helpful , and I do n't know if your family 's spread out or whatever -- Uh-huh . -- but most of , all my family lives like in the same county so , Oh , that 's wonderful , though . But it 's just kind of like get on the telephone and , it 's so and such days from such and such date -- Oh . -- and everybody just shows up . Oh , well , that is , that is helpful . Yeah , our family ranges from , oh , goodness , well , Australia , I have a brother lives in Australia , to , uh , Boise , Idaho , and , and , uh , all kinds of places . I would say you 're spread out , then .
