like every Sunday you go out , and you buy all these parts of the cow , and then you just cook them over a grill . That 's , like , in our house , it 's already built in . There 's this whole special place in the back so you can make a barbecue . I 've had , I 've had that meal in New York , uh , where they bring you a plank , sort of , with all this wonderful beef -- Yeah . -- parts of beef , cooked and barbecued -- Yeah . -- and it 's marvelous MUMBLEx . And then . I have to find a place around here that has that . Well , they have one in , uh , they have an Argentinean place down in Georgetown . So . Okay , I 'll keep that in mind , yeah . Um . You serve that yourself , or the , for a family ?
