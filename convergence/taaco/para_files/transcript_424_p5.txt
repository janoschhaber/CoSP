Uh-huh . -- zero lot home , or , Uh , we 've got a house , let 's see , we moved in about four years ago and it was , it had previously been unoccupied , but it had existed for three years . Okay . This is a whole block of homes that , uh , a builder built all of them and , I guess he , he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away , type of deal . So the whole block was all foreclosed . Oh . And , so , some were vacant for quite a while before they , you know , they finally sold them because there were so many .

And I 'm not sure what happened , but I do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for , for about four years . Oh , no . I , I , I found a lot of things ,
