Yeah . If , if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you , then you stay where you are . Then you only go there as a last resort . Uh-huh . Or people send you there as a last resort . Right , right . That 's what my grandparents , it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . Uh-huh . So that was their thinking . Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency . Right . And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make . Right . So they would n't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time . I guess that 's a problem too for people . Wait lists and all . Yeah , I guess . That , uh , you ca n't always get in when you want too and of course , you ca n't just sit around and wait . Right . When you need it , you need it -- Yeah . -- I guess . And the money is also another issue . How you 're going to pay for it . Right . At that stage of life you only have so much money left and I guess it 's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings . Yeah . I mean it is kind of fair , but it 's also not fair because they have their own children to raise . Sure . So it 's another problem . And you probably , if it were you , you probably would n't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price . Right , right . So , it , it 's just so complicated anymore , I think . People outlive their savings . And , with medicine being the way it is , you 're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down and they 're not necessarily enjoying life anymore . Yeah .
