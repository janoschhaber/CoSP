Yeah , yeah , so , Well , I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable . Oh , I know . I do n't have cable . Now I told MUMBLEx , no , we do n't have that station either , so , uh , I have n't been able to catch any of that , but just what little we caught on the news .
