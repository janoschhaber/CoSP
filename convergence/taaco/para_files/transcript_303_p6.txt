But , uh , well you ought to try that . It 's , it 's , it 's very good . I would probably like that . One or two times in my life I 've ever had venison , I 've loved it . But , you know , just , it 's just not , I do n't know people who hunt so , uh -- No . -- That 's , that 's supposed to be a wonderful place . W- , uh , uh , uh , here in Plano , well , we tend to go to Momo 's a , l- , fairly often . And , uh , sometimes we 'll go , you know , we , we also go to Chili 's and , uh , Colter 's Bar B Q , and , and uh , we go to , lil- , there is a little Thai place that 's over on Park that , we go to . My husband particularly likes that . We go into Dallas , a lot and , because we 're both were from the Richardson , North Dallas area , up until fairly recently . And , uh , we 'll go down to , uh , Blue Mesa Grill , Mexican food , and -- Oh , that 's good . Yes , I 've been there .
