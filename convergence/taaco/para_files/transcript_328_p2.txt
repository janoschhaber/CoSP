It was real gray -- Yeah . -- but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and I saw all those trees , it just really made me realize how much I miss the fall . Yeah . I do n't complain weather wise though , because it was also thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning , and the high was only fifty , and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon -- Ooh . -- so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies . I guess you have to take some things and leave some things . That 's right . Yeah , I 'm from Utah area , and they , you know , they have tons of canyons where the leaves change and they 're gorgeous -- Yeah . -- you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area . We did that when we lived up in Michigan . We went up to the upper peninsula , and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure . And then on leaf weekends it was , which is this time of the year , it 's bumper to bumper traffic , people as whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves , because they had to keep watching the road . Yeah , it 's kind of hazardous for driving -- Yes . -- that 's for sure . But I ca n't complain . I do n't know if I 've been spoiled . I 've been thinking it 's getting cold sooner than normal . We 've only lived here a couple of years . I think it is , and my family said that in Ohio there was just an article on , at the T V news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule --
