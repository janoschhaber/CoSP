Okay , should begin . Okay . All right . Uh , I can begin this , um , basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis -- Uh-huh . -- and the , the benefit program we have here is really quite good . I 'm , I 'm pretty pleased with it . They cover , uh , just about everything , vision , dental , medical -- Uh-huh . -- uh , you name it , and for me this is the first job I 've had where they 've covered that much , so I 'm pretty satisfied myself . Uh-huh . Um , what 's your situation ? I work for the University of New Hampshire , and -- Oh . -- uh , our benefits package is n't , uh , is n't quite as good in some ways . Uh , you know , overall I 'm satisfied with it . We do n't have the vision care , we do have the health care and the , uh , and the medi- , or the dental . Uh-huh . Uh . Are you a professor there ? No , I work in , I 'm a , on the professional administrative and technical staff , and I , effectively I run the telephone switch at , uh , at the University of New Hampshire . Oh , I see , okay . Uh , so the , uh , the benefits , uh , probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the , uh , the , uh , very generous vacation time and sick time . Oh , no doubt .
