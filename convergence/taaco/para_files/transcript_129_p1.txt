I think when you 're in college you kind of , you have more of a regular schedule -- Uh-huh . -- in terms of , you can watch every week . Yeah , that makes a big difference . So , yeah , I , I used to , when my kids were real little and I was home , I watched , where I was home where I watched things on a more regular basis . But right now , the last things I watched regularly was THIRTY SOMETHING when it first came out . Okay . Did you all ever watch that ? I , yeah , I started , too , and , uh -- Yeah . -- kind of , kind of worked away from that . Yeah . I , I have a hard time sticking with something -- Yeah . -- like , like on T V , because , it , like , it gets real aggravating if you miss it , for a week or two . You feel kind of left out . Right , right . But , um , right . I know , but I tell you what , um , we 're really strict with our kids about television , and one night , couple weeks ago , it was just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch , and we said okay , well we 'll sit down and we 'll , you know , look at what you want to see . Let 's just turn it on and see what 's on .
