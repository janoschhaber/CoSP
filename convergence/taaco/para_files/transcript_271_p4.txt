right . uh , father 's . My mother 's father 's family had quite a few , Uh-huh . uh , brothers and sisters . So , it was a large reunion of , of , of that group , uh , from that descendants . Uh-huh . And , uh , a lot of those people have , and at time , you know , they all knew one another . Right , right . And now it has gotten , uh , that , uh , a lot of those people are d- , have , uh , have died off , or , you know , what we are left with is the , the relatives of , of , The next generation , uh-huh . of that group . And so , uh , it 's not quite as close as it used to be . So , I think people feel less of a desire to really go . I know that , Wh , why do you think that it 's less close than it used to be ? Well , I , I just think that , uh , you know , at that ti- , when , when they were a- , you know , the , those were all brothers and sisters a lot and or they were all in the same ar- , geographical location . Uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh . You know , back around , you know , in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up , uh , you know , they were all located together , Right , right . in one small community . Right . And as , as time grew , I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth . And now when they come together it 's , it 's generally , you know , like say the kids of those people who are not , you know , anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the , the closeness that they used to be there .
