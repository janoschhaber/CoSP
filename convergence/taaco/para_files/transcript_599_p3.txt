Clarence Thomas or , Yeah , the Thomas and Anita Hill business . Right . I , I mean that 's , that 's the closest thing . I deeply cared about that . Uh-huh . Uh , and I sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine and when I arrived at her house , she was engrossed in that . We ended up watching it for a couple of hours . Zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and ea- , watching it some more . And I thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on . But even then , I did n't end up doing it on my own . Uh , uh , Yeah .
