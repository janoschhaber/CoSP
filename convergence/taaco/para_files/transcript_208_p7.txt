Because I lived in Indiana all my life and , you know , you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that , or above the age of fifteen or something , -- Uh-huh . -- but , other than that it 's nothing up there like it is down here . Yeah , I 'm not sure why that is . I mean , generally in the Midwest it seems to be less , much less . I mean , maybe it 's because of the winters . Probably . Uh , or maybe just because , you know , there 's , there 's a lot more flat lands , you know , out in the West . Yeah . So it makes biking a better alternative for transportation . Yeah . It , there 's a lot of bikers around here . It 's , it 's really neat . Uh-huh .
