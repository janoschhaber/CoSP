and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it and , uh , and this was just recent , so I really ca n't complain about this one . How did you put that many miles on it , in , Um , well , I used , four or five years ? I used to work , uh , it was a seventy mile trip everyday , you know , two ways was seventy miles . Oh , a hundred and forty mile trip ? No , it was , it was just seventy miles . Oh , thirty-five miles each way . Yeah . Yeah . And , uh , I did that for about three years and it really , it really added up . I 've only taken , uh , maybe two trips that were about four hours long dow- , uh , down to Shreveport . And , uh , the rest of it was , you know , it 's just basically driving a long ways to work .
