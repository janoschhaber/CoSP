Yeah . Yeah , that 's about how I am on popular music . I do n't , you know , you do n't , I do n't know enough about it because I just listen , uh , everything I listen to is what I buy , not whatever they play on the radio so , Well , you have to figure out what to buy , or do you just buy along the same artist ? Uh , I , yeah , I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time . I do n't really switch around to new things very often . Yeah . It 's just , it 's , you know , it 's way to hectic and too confusing . Yeah , so you keep buying the same artists until you do n't like an album , then you stop ? Uh , yeah , generally , or , about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know -- Yeah . -- will buy something new that I have n't heard and I listen to it that way , but as far as , yeah , I do n't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I 've heard it . Yeah ,
