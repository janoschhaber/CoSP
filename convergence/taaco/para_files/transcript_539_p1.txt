Uh , -- read one book , I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things , that , uh -- Uh-huh . -- went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases , and in many cases looking at what had , at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right , went back to the jurors , uh , based on the deliberations . Some of them did say that , you know , when they were the only one left opposing the verdict , uh , you know , everyone was getting on them so , so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote does n't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict . Yeah , I , I understand .
