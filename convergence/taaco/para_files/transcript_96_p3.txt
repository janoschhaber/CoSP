And normally I , do n't eat , we do n't eat like that during the week because of the , you know , the calories and the fat in it . Uh-huh . But you know , when we 're having guests , we just kind of say , oh just do it . And I made blueberry cobbler and we had extra crust with it , Yeah . it was so fattening . That sounds good . But , I do n't think we gained any weight from it so . Well , every once in a while I , I think I feel the same way . When I 'm entertaining , I do n't take that thing into consideration unless it 's really , really , like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it 's too rich simply because they do n't want the extra calories , so I think dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play , sometimes . Right , I made an apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over and she did n't eat it . Oh yeah . But I did bake apples so that it would be , not brownies , you know . I figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies . Yeah , yeah . So , um , I 've read a good brownie recipe . Oh , that 's good . But , uh , anyway , so I guess that 's about what I did when I entertained . Uh-huh . So , do you have anything else you want to say about it ? Um , nothing comes to mind right off , so I guess not . Okay , well it was nice talking to you . Okay you too . Okay , bye .
