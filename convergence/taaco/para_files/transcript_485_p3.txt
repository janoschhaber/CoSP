Um , I put it on the frame , the quilting frame . Have you , are you familiar with that ? Uh-huh . Yeah , okay . But , um , my , again , my mother back in Indiana , we had a quilting frame in our basement , and she would , she would quilt whole quilts by herself . Oh , my God . Um , yes , which , I was always amazed . I have one of them . Um , but , uh , you know , to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that , it 's a tremendous amount of work . Well , I have n't done tons of them . But , um , I used to do more before , um , before I had , before we got our baby , but . Oh , you think , children , you can , um , use crafts to make wonderful things for children . Uh-huh . I think when babies , I think afghans and , and the crocheted little sweaters , and , are , are wonderful . And , and they 'll wear them . Yes , exactly . Once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear them .
