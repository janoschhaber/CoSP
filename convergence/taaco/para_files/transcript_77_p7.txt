it 's In our parking lots , uh , two or three days ago I saw one of the new Honda sports cars . Uh-huh . Uh , I , I ca n't remember what the name is . It 's the thirty-five or forty thousand dollar one , whatever it is , and it looked , it resembled a Mazaratti -- Um . -- very , very closely . And it 's an absolutely beautiful automobile -- Uh-huh . -- and well appointed and so forth , but to pay that much money for an automobile , uh , is just , I ca n't , I ca n't conceive of doing that . Yeah , that 's , uh , I went to a , a car show down here about , uh , about two weeks ago , and , um , you know , of course they had the normal , the Ford , the , the Chevrolet , that stuff . But then you started looking at the , uh , uh , they had Ferrari there , they had , uh , B M W and all these other kinds of cars . And Ferrari did n't even let you near the car , I mean , they were , that 's how expensive they were . Uh-huh . And then you saw , uh , hundred thousand dollar cars , you saw eighty thousand dollar cars , and even , even though I , I , I do enjoy cars , I enjoy , um , driving them , I enjoy , uh , riding in them and everything , but , I ca n't see buying , or paying more for a car than I would for a house , you know . That 's true . Well , That does n't seem likely . The difference there is , too , uh , is between us is that I am not really crazy about driving .
