or . I , I , well , the way I 'd like to try and use it is , um , you , you , you make your purchases at , at prime buying time -- Uh-huh . -- and then you pay that off and do n't use it until , uh , it 's paid off . Uh-huh . That 's , that 's my ideal way . Uh-huh . How , how do you use it ? . Emergencies come along , and I -- Yeah -- -- and I use it . -- that 's understandable , exactly . Uh , like , uh , my car , uh , had a major problem , and -- Uh-huh . -- seven hundred dollars , and -- Right , right . -- uh , things just come up and you just never get to use it the way you 'd really like to . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Well , actually I do have quite a few more credit cards than you have . Um , and I use them , you know , like my American Express I use for , you know , gas , things like that , and I pay that off monthly , and then , um , some other credit cards , like store credit cards , you know , I do have them up there a little bit , but , uh . Uh-huh . I try not to use them too often . But living in this area , uh , like I live fifteen miles west of Washington , D C -- Um . -- it 's a very expensive area . Yeah . So , sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something . Yeah . Well , I , I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards , and I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble -- Right . -- so we just disposed of them , paid them off , and -- Uh-huh . -- got out of it . I just . Uh-huh , well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that . Yeah . Uh-huh . MUMBLEx . Now are you married , that you both , you and your wife use a credit card , or ? Yeah , yeah .
