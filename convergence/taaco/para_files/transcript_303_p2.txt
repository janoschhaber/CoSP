Sometimes I think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner -- Yes . -- or lunches so , uh , it just , you know , it just varies , we do a mix . Sometimes it 's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband and it would n't even really matter which restaurant it was , just to , you know , have a moment of peace and quiet without -- Yes . -- little ones at the table . Yes . So , uh , I guess -- Well , -- I guess actually on those , those times , uh , we even , there are times I even say , oh , please do n't sit us next to a table with other children , this is our night out . So but , uh , anyway , where do you like to eat ? Uh , well , uh , we do n't have any children so , uh , we tend to , like to try all sorts of different things . And , uh , we 're very attracted to exotic food . Uh-huh . And , uh , we like Indian food , and Thai cuisine and , uh , sort of gourmet Mexican and , uh , things like that , as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and , uh , Chinese and things , and , and things of that sort . Now , yes , of course , we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers -- Right . -- or something like that , too . And , uh , we probably go out one to two times a week .
