Like I am , probably within a year I would like to buy a new car . Uh-huh . So , I kind of have a , an amount in my mind and I am making every effort to , to sal- , put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever . Uh-huh . Yeah . Uh , cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget . Not only for buying them , but for keeping them on the road too . Right .
