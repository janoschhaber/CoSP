Well , this is an unusual topic . What do you think about it ? Yeah , I , at first I , it took eight times to find you so I told my husband , uh , you know , what should I say and then he reminded me , but , uh , uh , hi- , in his family , uh , what they usually do , on his dad 's side , his mom or , uh , the aunts will send out little postcards , like , two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the , the , where to meet and , you know , just , to bring anything , and so they just notify everyone by mail , and then they just meet at , like , a park or something to have like a , a short , uh , or a small , uh , dinner type thing . Well , that sounds great , Ellen .
