Because , uh , I , I think about that a lot . But , you know , when I first moved here was when they , well , no , I guess it was about a year ago they did this . This interstate seventy-five song . Uh-huh . Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety-five and everything . That was kind of a funny song but they sure do , it seems to me like they really love their Cowboys here .
