Now , not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment , but some of them have already been in youth centers . Um . And that kind of thing , and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals , and I 'm not talking about necessarily in the school system , I 'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action . Uh-huh . I think that 's one reason we have problems in schools , uh , and some of them are our problems , but a lot of it 's because everything society wants , we are supposed to do . Uh-huh . But that 's another subject but , Well , that 's probably true . W- , Anyway , I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has , making a decision what to do with them . Um , yeah , I guess that 's not an easy solution . There 's , there 's no easy -- Uh-huh . -- solution for that . I do n't , I do n't know that there is an easy solution , but if you could find a way to prevent some of it , and I 'm not sure what it would be . Uh-huh . It would be money better spent than , do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard ? That 's true . I 'm sure it is , yeah .

Uh , I 'm for it in -- I guess I am -- -- in some cases . -- for certain cri- , -- Yeah . -- yeah , in certain crimes . What kind of crimes would you d- , use it for ? Uh , premeditated murder . Uh-huh . Crimes of that nature , I think should definitely , any mass murderer type individual . I , I would consider it for sexual abuse of children , on going . Um . You know , not one instance , but perpetual abusers of children . Uh-huh . Well , you always have castration . Well , you know , somebody elected that recently . Yes , I read about that .
