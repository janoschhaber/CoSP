What was one of the latest ones that you 've seen , actually ? Oh , I gue , I think we rented PRETTY WOMAN -- Uh . -- a couple weeks , months ago . Right . The last two years , I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home . I 've , uh , Uh-huh . uh , become available to come and go more often , so I said `` hey , it 's worth it , I 'll just go at the matinee hour and I can see what I please . '' Yeah . It 's no more costly than renting one . The last , see I went about two or three weeks ago and saw F X TWO and that is a really good movie , if you like special effects , kind of gory and lots of , you know -- Uh-huh . -- action . I have not done that one , I do n't know if I have even heard of that one .
