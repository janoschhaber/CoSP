So I took his suggestion and I , uh , took the , the dog to a hospital . The dog hospital there and they said they 'd keep her there for three days . Well , she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care . It cost me over five hundred dollars . Ouch . Plus , the , the , uh , the vet sent me a bill for what he did and , uh , then she recouped . She was okay for a couple of years . And then she got sick on me again and I brought her to a different vet this time and I told the vet what medication I had given her and everything . And , uh , he gave me the medication , the same medication that I gave her the last time and she was okay and she 's been okay every since . It 's been about two years now . Huh . Well , that 's great , it really is . I , I 'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time . Yeah . Well , the , see the problem is if , if the , if someone would have came up to me and said it 's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive . What do you want to do ? I probably would have had second thoughts . Yeah . Of course , you would . But what they , well , what they do is , is they say , well it 's going to cost , you know , twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this and , and , you know , and it creeps up on you .
