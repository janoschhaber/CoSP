is there 's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in . Uh-huh . Uh , I grew up in New York and -- Wow . -- uh , the place , or not New York City , upstate New York -- Uh-huh . -- and I went to , uh , the City of Rochester School District -- Uh-huh . -- and s- , a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs and it was n't , we were n't too far removed geographically from each other , but the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , one of the things that probably would have been better if , is if the entire county had had , had just one school system . Right . And that would result in some , uh , could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was , you know , all the very rich people went out to the , move out to the suburbs and the city had a very low tax base so they did n't have a lot -- Uh-huh . -- of money to work with . As a result , the schools were rundown , there was n't as many , you know , of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked .
