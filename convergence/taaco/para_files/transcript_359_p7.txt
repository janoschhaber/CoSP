You just , oh , and , and you volunteer for the Boy Scouts , huh ? Oh , yeah , I rent my kids . Uh-huh . Well , s- , sometimes , uh , It 's better than , you know , owning on them and making payments on them , and , you know , things like that . Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea . Have , uh , you said you did it in the High Sierras . Uh , do you ever , you know , just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack ? Oh , yeah , yeah . Uh , not recently because , you know , like the Boy Scouts makes it so that I go like once a month , you know . Uh-huh . Someplace . But , uh , there 's , uh , some , some stuff that I want to do with like Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or something like that . So , you know , they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and -- Uh-huh . -- off you go . Which seems kind of reasonable because that means you do n't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you , which seems a , a , just a tad more relaxing . Well , I , probably , probably . That 's , uh , well , my , my other things that I like to do in my spare time , I 'm , I like swimming . Uh-huh . Which is in now . I 've done that and I , I also , when I like something , I usually try to figure out how to make money off of it .
