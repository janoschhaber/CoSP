So . Have you heard about Saturns ? I 've heard some about Saturns . I do n't know a lot about them . I have n't been over , uh , to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight 's paper that said that their , uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the , I guess , the Japanese cars . Ooh , that 's great . Actually that 's kind of the type of car that I , I 'm thinking about we might get . Saturns , you ca n't go to a dealer unless you go to a , a Saturn dealer . This , this offshoot of G M . Yeah . And , uh , supposedly , they 've got great customer satisfaction from what things I 've heard . Um . Yeah , I 've heard a lot of people like them . Uh , yet I do n't know wh- , whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point . I 'm kind of , my card and , uh , desires tend to be pretty picky and so , uh . Well , like what ?
