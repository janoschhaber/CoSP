we were , we had , we were staying at the other end of the island , and we drove into San Juan to catch our plane . Uh-huh . It was at night , and this boy really wanted to go on the beach , and they look at you crazy -- Uh-huh . -- you do n't go on the beach . Uh-huh . -- Well , it 's a big tourist town , you know , do n't they , do n't people go for a walk on the beach at night ? And they said , no , it 's very safe in the daytime -- Uh-huh . -- but at night , they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens , pretty much telling people , be wary , you know , and get off the beach . It 's just so sad , you know , it is just really so sad , you know , it is just really so sad because you ca n't enjoy anything any more . Um , in San Antonio I do n't know what the answer is . Education , I think , is a lot of it . Um , so many of the kids are drop outs . Um , uh , there 's a lot of drugs that go on , and that they just have hopeless lives . They , they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels . I think education helps a little bit there . Um , then again , I do n't know really what steps there are that they , Well , what they , what they say they try to do is to get the kids , um , early and young . Uh-huh . And what we have here in Burlington , which it does n't cost a lot of money , but they have a kids council -- Uh-huh . -- that they have all these after school activities for kids .
