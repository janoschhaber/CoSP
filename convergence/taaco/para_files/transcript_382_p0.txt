Uh , I guess my personal opinion , I , I do n't mind paying taxes necessarily . I , I just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way . Right . Uh , sometimes when I hear what , what they 're , even what , even what the politicians are making , you know , when they 're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that , uh , I think that 's just a bit too much to be paying them , uh , and that 's all tax money . When you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much , it 's just billions of dollars that 's , I think is just being thrown away . Right , right . And then when you read about that they 're spending all the money on , you know , these studies that have no relevance whatsoever , that kind of ticks you off , too . Yeah . But , uh , somebody , somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we 're paying , it 's not that we mind paying taxes , it 's that we 're paying too much for a lousy government . Yeah . And I , I , I tend to agree with that . Yeah . I 'm not really into what they 're doing -- Yeah . -- per se , and I think there 's just too many , too many levels of bureaucracy .
