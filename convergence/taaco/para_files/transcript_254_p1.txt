I live right on the ocean so it 's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if I lived in some of the valleys inland , Uh-huh . but the major cause here , and we always seem to , and it seems to be validated by the press , is the car pollution . We do n't have too much industrial pollution . Yeah , yeah . Uh , car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that , that I can really put my finger on here . Um , that is n't the same in the Washington area because we do n't have any major , um , industry except for , uh , government and services . And the , the transportation situation is such that , uh , all the car pollution is , is absolutely awful . Um , also the worth of the hub of three airports in this general area there is , uh , National , Dulles , and then , uh , Baltimore , Washington .
