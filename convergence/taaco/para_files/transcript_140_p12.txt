We have a nine month old with another on the way -- Uh-huh . -- and we thought , well maybe when they 're a little bit bigger -- Yeah . -- then we 'll , or get into a house with a little more space . I 'd love to have , have some animals . Uh-huh . But I like dogs and my husband likes cats . So we have n't reached a real agreement on that yet . If we get a place where we can have both , it 'll be great , but until then , Yeah , I like both , but since I 'm in an apartment , I just , I do n't think an apartment is big enough for a dog . Dogs , to me , dogs need a yard , even little dogs . Uh-huh . They just need a yard . Cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine . But I just think dogs need , need to be outside , though . So , I agree with you . I , if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat , or even a bird or a fish tank or something , you know . Yeah , now that 's an idea -- Something small -- -- with the small babies . -- that she can watch , but wo n't take too much care . Yeah , because , you kind of , even , even a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something . Uh-huh . They 're not as likely to as a dog might , I guess . But with little ones , I 'd be kind of scared , to get anything that has teeth or claws . Especially when they 're not quite to the age of understanding that they 're hurting , you know , that they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk . Oh yeah . And if I was a cat or dog , I 'd respond probably by biting or something . I do n't know . Oh , yeah . That 'd be my self defense . But , Uh-huh . Well , I think we probably reached our time limit . Yeah , probably so , and I 'm out of , out of good ideas for a hobby anyway . Oh , okay . Well it was good talking to you . Thank you for calling . All right . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
