how , is this open and shut , you know , like you were saying , or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened . You know , a jury like that . You know , we , They could be a good idea to , that could work . You know , kind of MUMBLEx off what we 've been talking about here , uh , I believe that our , we 've become almost a litigious society where we , everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff , and -- Yeah . -- although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers , maybe we do n't need to do that . Uh-huh . You know , maybe , instead of being so quick to sue you , uh , if you have a disagreement with someone , instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff , maybe you nee , maybe you , and if you want to , your lawyer or your , your opponent need to go face this group of twenty-five or a judge MUMBLEx like -- Good idea . -- they have on T V -- Yeah . -- and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case . Yeah , right that 's , And let 's , you know , let 's get rid of some of this harassment suing . Right , that 's , that 's a good idea . I , in the BIBLE it says , uh , if you have something against somebody , to go to them first , and if that does n't work , then to go get somebody , you know , a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them , and if that does n't work , to take it to the whole church . So that 's right off that same kind of principle . You bet ,
