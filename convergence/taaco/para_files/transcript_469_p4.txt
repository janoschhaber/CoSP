Uh-huh . So , we are at the end of the mail route . Yeah . Like I said , we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas . Yeah , I guess so , huh . But , uh , you know , right now , uh , what we did , my wife and I , is we got a mobile home . Uh-huh . One of these twelve by forty-eight 's that got repoed , Uh-huh . And , uh , swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day , you know . Uh-huh . I 'm in construction and , uh , you know I just had this place you know to shower up while I was you know out here , you know , putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in you know . Uh-huh . And , uh , I came home from work one Friday afternoon and our truck was back . Everything we had was in boxes and my wife said , uh , we 're moving . Uh .
