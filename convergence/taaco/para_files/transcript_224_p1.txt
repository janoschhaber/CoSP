They 're , uh , relatively nonexistent from , uh , from what I hear from my friends . It seems like , uh , even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable , that are sort of like a chain , if I can use that word -- Right . -- uh , still you have to deal with the people that , you know , happen to be operating it locally and , uh , it 's just a matter of , of trust , you know , I think they feel that these people are , um , under qualified basically and underpaid , and I think that sort of goes hand in hand so it 's , it 's difficult for them . Well , we certainly found that to be true . Huh-uh . Uh , indeed we 've , our children are now eleven and nine . Huh-uh . And we moved away from institutionalized child care -- Huh-uh . -- if we can call those chain kind of things , Right . like that . Uh , by that name . Right . And found that , uh , more creative avenues were the right answer for us . Huh-uh . Huh-uh . Uh , at one point in time we 've had au pairs , Huh-uh . by trading services with them , Huh-uh . and that worked for a while , but they were really , adequate ones were really tough to find .
