Oh , okay , well , first , they always say , get to know your country first before you leave , I mean -- Uh-huh . -- I , I lived in places , like when I lived in Washington , uh , Washington , D C , I never went to the Washington Memorial , and then when I went back to visit , I went to the Washington Memorial . You know , I 've heard , we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often , and that must be the thing . They really had n't either . They went to the Memorial , you know , when they go , it 's on business -- Right . -- it 's not really just to getting to sight see . Right . Well , it 's , it 's a beautiful city . Oh , I bet it is , too . But , the problem is , like first time I went out of here , and they took me to Las Vegas -- Uh-huh . -- and that was the most boring place on earth . Oh , now my husband and I , we go different places . But our child- , but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close . Yeah . Did , uh , did , like , did you go to Disneyland ?

Oh . and , uh , then after that , I , my sister lives in Turkey , so when I was like fourteen , fifteen , I went , I went to Turkey . Oh , And this Christmas , I went to Turkey . But basically , it 's a , for the past couple of years , I , since my parents are , are , well , I 'm from Argentina , and my parents live down there . So , all the traveling I do is alone .
