And , uh , so , but I have n't really had any bad problems with credit cards . There 's , you know , they have , uh , wonderful features , they 're there when you need them . Yeah , yeah . You know , like in emergencies , or whatever . And then they have bad drawbacks , too . Yeah . It 's , it 's awfully easy . I mean high interest , it 's like paying twice .
