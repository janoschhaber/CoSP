It was , it was five o'clock in the evening and I found out he was still there at school . And they were calling me and they said somebody 's got to pick him up . And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up , she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school . I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff . And he had a hundred and four fever . They could n't , uh , give him anything because they 're not allowed to at school and everything . Right .
