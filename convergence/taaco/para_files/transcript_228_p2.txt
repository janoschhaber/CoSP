In here in Denison . Okay , we- , see , that 's north . Or down here in Denison , yeah . Okay , I live , I live in Plano , so it 's north to me . Okay , up here then . I say down , I 'm really from Kentucky . I was going to say you did n't have the typical , you have a southern accent , Uh-huh . but you do n't have a Texas accent . Right . Well I 'm originally from , uh , Ohio , Cincinnati , Oh , okay . so I 'm famili , uh , familiar with , uh , That area , that dialect .

Yeah , we 'll have enough bedroom space , it 's , we 're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small . Uh-huh . And so , we 're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it . And then shuffle the rooms around a little bit . That 's kind of like what we 'd like to do . We just had a baby a couple months ago and we 've got a den , it 's more or less a spare room . Uh-huh . We rarely go in there , except for to play chess . Uh-huh . We want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter and , uh , we need the one extra room . Like , like you said , our rooms are too s- , the bedrooms are too small , the living room and kitchen are huge ,
