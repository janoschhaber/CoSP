And , you know , we , I think we feel about the same way you do real strongly . We , uh , we have several credit cards , though . We have a gas card , our Visa , and then , of course , the American Express , and I think we have a couple of department stores . Uh-huh . But , we use it the same way , and , uh , I find the one I use mostly , uh , aside from the American Express , I do use my Sears card . Uh-huh . But , uh , I try , a- , as with the American Express , I try to pay it , you know , as it comes in . Right . Right . So , uh , It 's , it 's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill . That 's usually how we do it . I know when I travel , or when I used to travel overseas quite a bit , what I would do on my American Express card is before I would , before I left I would mail a check to , to American Express -- Uh-huh . -- and , you know , have some idea of how much was there , you know , I 'd sent them , you know , several hundred dollars , or whatever -- Uh-huh . -- I felt I would spend . Yeah . And then use it then . Yeah . But , uh , for hotels and , and so forth . But , uh , but I knew that it was paid . I knew -- Right . -- I knew that I had that much -- Yeah . -- credit , going in . Sometimes , you know , sometimes I would go over , but it would n't , you know , it would n't hit me in a big , in a big way because -- Right . -- I knew that , uh , I would have it covered in that respect . Right .
