I 'm like you astonishing what the younger ages know , and they react to what they see at home . You know . Huh-uh . If they see violence at home , that 's what you 're going to get from the kids at school . Exactly . You know . It really is , and that 's kind of sad . Well , you can see it in the work place , you know . Used to be when you had a personality conflict you just , you worked with it and you got through it . Huh-uh . Now , you know , people get fired , or what 's even worse , is they promote them into a position that they ca n't handle and let them get fired . Yeah . Or , one thing or the other . You look at another kind of society like the Japanese . You put that many people on that small of a space , they 've learned to live together . Okay . It 's in their culture . Huh-uh . And one of the things that 's in their culture that I really think the major corporations should pay attention to , is the fact that , while Japan was becoming a great power , financially , the people that worked for those companies , worked for the same company they worked for at sixty-five , as they did when they were eighteen . Teen . And the company , took it upon itself to find a position for these people . If they were n't fit for the job they were hired for , they did n't just can them , they made a position for them some where . Huh-uh . You look at Frito Lay . My wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist .
