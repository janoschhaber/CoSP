Yep . Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty-six base mach- , machine . Oh , yeah . I bet that 's a pretty nice setup . Yes , it is . Uh , unfortunately I need all of it . Yep . Uh , for example , I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that 's a third of a meg in beta size . Wow . And that , I know that , uh , brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because , I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty-six machine , Yep . and it brought it to its knees . Wow . Just in the ability to handle . And then I have , uh , a three eighty-six F X a sixteen bit machine , Uh-huh . at home . And I 'm really pleased with it . Uh-huh . It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and , Sure . uh , databases , database searches .
