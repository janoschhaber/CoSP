No , it 's making that , that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it . I was never able to , to master all that . In fact my brother and sister both , they were , oh , thirteen , sixteen years older than I , they went through the , uh , parent thing where you 've got to practice or you 're not going out to play thing , and when it came to my turn the folks said no we 're not going through that again , they sold the piano , and is the turns out I was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to , so I , Uh-huh . that 's one of things I felt like I missed in life and I , I really , in fact , uh , one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin , that is played on , uh , piano . I just , you know , I can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time to do that , Oh , MUMBLEx , maybe one of these days , I 'll , you know , I 'm kind of like you , maybe one of these days I 'll get around to it , I 'll do something with the piano , but probably not . So we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance , uh , Just never got a chance to come out .
