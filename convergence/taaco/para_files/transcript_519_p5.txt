Uh , I have , uh , been know to keep trucks or cars for oh , ten or twelve years , but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff in them you know . That 's right . Yeah , mine 's , uh , seven years old and I think last year was , that was a rough year for it . I had a number of expenses . Uh-huh . But , uh , I am hoping that most of them were just kind of , uh , you know the , as you get to a certain number of miles , you have to get everything replaced , brakes , shocks and all that . So , I just went through that whole set last year . Uh-huh . I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again . Those things can really upset your budget when they , when they come in . Uh , you know , it 's nice to have a little bit set aside for the , for the unexpected shall we say . Right . So that it does n't , uh , kill you all in one month . Right . What line of work are you in ?
