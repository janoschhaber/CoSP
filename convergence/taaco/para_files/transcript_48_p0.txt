Well , how do you feel about it ? Well , uh , I do n't have any strong convictions about it , that 's for sure . Um , I know I have n't done any Peace Corps service , and I do n't know anybody in my immediate family that has , or , you know , has ever even thought about it . Do you know , uh , do you know anybody that 's been it ? No , the , the only people I know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries , and that 's only because I went to Baylor , and a lot of students from Baylor go and , and serve as missionaries during the summer . But I think , I think that 's a terrible idea . That 's like forcing someone to donate to a charity . Yeah . I mean , and it 's nice to , to try to teach young people some , some , uh , uh , civil , uh , consciousness , but forcing them to , to donate basically their time and efforts , Yeah , it 's definitely up to the person , uh , so , I 'd have to say that , uh , it , you know , the people who do it , well , some feel it 's rewarding . I do n't know , you know ,
