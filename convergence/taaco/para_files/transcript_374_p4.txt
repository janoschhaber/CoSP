We do n't have a big problem with turtles , but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes . Um -- And I , -- I would be afraid of that . Well , I ca n't think of a time that I 've been fishing that I have n't run into one or two of them . Do they ever get on your hook ? No , we , uh , occasionally I 'll catch an eel -- Uh-huh . -- on a , on a hook , but never the snakes . They just kind of , Are they poisonous snakes ? Uh , we have a lot of cotton mouth , so yes they are , definitely -- Uh-huh . -- and they live in little shallow , little coves that I like to fish in , so I seem them swimming by every once in a while . Yeah , I think I 'd be a little bit afraid of those . Yeah , they can , they 're , they 're certainly ugly . Uh-huh . We , uh , saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws ' place last year . It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know . Great big snake , and it , of course , it scared the women to death , you know , but the men come out and said oh , well , that 's only a , a king snake , it wo n't really hurt you , you know . But it looked so bad -- Yeah . -- and it was so big , that it might not would have hurt us , but we sure felt like it was hurting us , just being there , you know . Definitely . But they 're scary looking . Do you have bass ? Yes , uh , I think that , uh , probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else . Right . Well , that 's pretty much the same way here . Uh-huh . I , Now , they have a lot of bass tournaments . Well , we have those . I do n't -- Uh-huh . -- I inevitably , if I enter one of those , I never catch a thing . Oh , no . I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it . Uh-huh . Well that 's kind of , we 've never entered a tournament or anything . We 're not that big into fishing , but I see a lot of people ,
