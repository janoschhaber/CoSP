That 's that microscopic stuff , you know . Uh-huh . uh-huh , not my kneecap . So , I 'm , I 'm being very good . Yeah . But , I miss it . I really do , and I . Oh , that , it 's so aggravating to uh , to have an injury like that . My wife , uh , runs or likes to run , but uh , she 's , well , we moved , we moved down to the north end of Oak Cliff in the Castle Park area . Oh , really . Yeah , and she started running down there and all the hills . Uh-huh . And she lasted about two weeks , and her ankles could n't take it anymore . She was used to running , you know flat tracks and whatnot , and uh , ever since that , it 's just been real difficult . It 's real aggravating , because she starts in and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff . Even if she does get on flat ground , so she 's kind of in the same mode . She was all ready to get back into it and start running , uh five K 's , and ten K 's and stuff this spring , and she just has n't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape . And , when you want to do it , it 's really , really aggravating . You know , it , it 's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise , and it 's another thing to , to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health . I can you understand that . Yeah . Uh , I do n't really want to , I just , know I need to . Well , it 's ... I make myself do it and if I do it , okay , I do n't love it , , but I will do it . Sure . Uh , it 's not anything I would want to , but I can really tell the difference , since I have not been able to walk . I have got to be so much more careful with what I do . Yeah , yeah . It 's depressing .
