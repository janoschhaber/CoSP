and this I think is one of the big problems , Yeah . In this area too since , you know , in Texas we 're so spread out , Yeah . we have to drive so far , but I know in Colorado I have witnessed that where it just , uh , it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts , but we 're even getting it here . We can drive into , when we 've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas and you can tell it in the mornings too . My husband likes to go out and jog and there 's just a brown fog here and we do n't even have any mountains that are , Yeah . holding it in . But they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together , the worse it gets . Well that makes a lot of sense . I mean I , I had n't thought about it that way but it , it , You do n't have to have mountains that are stopping it . Yeah . And , uh , they make , uh , making more and more high-rise buildings and , uh , so yeah , we can comment and we did n't see this a few years ago . No , and I think , It was pretty clear here . Yeah , and I think that , that more and more it 's becoming apparent to people that the earth , which includes all the people on it and everything that 's going on it , is a , is an organism of sorts , Right . and that there is a , a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it , it 's going to tell us about it , and , uh , we 're going to feel it , and I think it 's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy , Uh-huh . uh , in this country , uh , whether people are willing to get out of their cars , Yeah . and in this country , uh , the , the solution that , that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable . For example , Yeah . taxing people heavily for using their cars . And , uh , I have a little sports car that I enjoy using and I know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive
