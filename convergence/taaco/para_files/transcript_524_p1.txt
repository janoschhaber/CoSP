but the basic idea , it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , the solution that he came up with for plastics , and it was really quite amazing , he says , well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them . Oh really . He came to the conclusion , plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it 's , it 's low weight , but it 's high volume so it takes up a lot of space -- Right . -- and there 's almost no energy , there 's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling , but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it , produce electricity . Huh . So his solution was to burn plastic . Collect it and burn it . Well , it 's carbon so that makes sense , like a carbon fuel of some sort , but -- Yeah . -- what -- And it 's more than even paper or something like that . There is more energy in it per pound or whatever .
