Yeah . And , uh , somebody walks in there with a gun . I mean , they 're going to want the money , and you can tell by the people who are always caught , that these people are there to get money for drugs . I mean , they do n't want the money so , uh , so they can do something else with it . No , they do n't want the money for food , that 's for sure . Right , right , and so . Well , but you know , the , the strange thing , uh , perhaps , not strange , but something that many people do n't realize , is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids , because , uh , I 'm a retired educator . Okay . And , in fifty-one and fifty-two , the police came to the high school where I was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs , how to recognize the pushers -- Yeah .
