But it 's , uh , it 's great for mowing . Fro- , from that aspect , you 're right . And , and it does n't take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff . But yes , I 'm used to , uh , walking out the back yard and you can play catch across the back yard and you 've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball , but , do n't do it around here .

And it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city . I had n't thought about it that way . S- , so moving up thirty-five , I stopped when I got to Denton . Uh . It ju- , well see now , with our jobs mainly hitting downtown Dallas we could n't go too much further ,
