Uh-huh . -- for some reason during the night , the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through and , uh , the next morning , uh , when my roommate got up and , and , uh , did not feed it right away , it decided that , that it was going to protest . And so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket , for me . Looking , looking at me eye to eye , all the time while it was doing it . All right . Have I got your attention now ? Oh , yes .
