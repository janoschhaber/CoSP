Uh , it does seem to be a lot of habits to break . I , uh , was n't raised as a kid on it , but my kids are and so they , they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do , and we were doing all right there until , uh , the price dropped out and they were n't worth anything anymore . Uh-huh . And we , it took us , almost a year to get a garbage sack full . We just do n't drink that many . So as far as at home use , uh , we 'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something and , and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in , uh , at the time it was still , oh , about forty or fifty cents a pound , and we came out with about a dollar , it just really was n't worth it . And a lot of hassle all year round and cans laying , Yeah . Yeah . So , they , they realized , you know , well , of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old . That was n't , uh , that was a big deal , but we decided it was n't worth us keeping it and then , uh , T I started keeping up with , uh , cans there , so occasionally I 'll bring whatever I 've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there . Least it gets back into the system , but , as far as a habit at the house , uh , I have n't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up .
