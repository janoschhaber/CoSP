and , you know , all kinds of physical problems , so it just became too much for me to handle , even though I would have liked to have had her stay , with her health being what it was she could n't -- Uh-huh . -- anymore . Yep , we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life , but he was essentially too proud and too independent -- Yeah . -- so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad -- Uh-huh . -- he lived in his own house as long as he could -- Yeah . -- but he was living alone , had an upstairs apartment , could barely make it up the steps -- Oh . -- to the top without a great deal of pain , and this , eventually things just went too far -- Yeah . -- and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home . Yes , well , I think sometimes when people get to be a certain age , other people have to kind of help them make decisions . It sure would n't have been Granny 's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home , but she 's accepted it real well now -- Right -- -- so . -- well that 's , yeah , that 's right that the children have some responsibility , too , to their parents and such , to help decide what 's the right thing . Well , we enjoyed -- And . -- having her here , but we feel she 's much safer where she is now . She still continues to fall , but when she does there , a nurse is right there to help her -- Uh-huh . -- and I know she 's eating the right things , and her doctor 's right there where he can come in and check on her , so . It became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair -- Yep . -- so , I think she 'll adjust ,
