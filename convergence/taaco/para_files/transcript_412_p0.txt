I still watch and I tape because I 'm not home . Oh , . And , uh , let 's see , that 's GENERAL HOSPITAL , and then , uh , at night , uh , I do n't , uh , when I sit down , I do n't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock -- I know . -- when my kids get in bed and , and , uh , then I watch , uh , what do I watch at nine o'clock . Let 's see , oh , well , Tuesday nights I guess , we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like . Right . And , uh , Are they little ? I have a seven year old and a ten year old .

I watch KNOTS LANDING on Thursday nights , for pure entertainment , nothing else . Right . Yeah . Well I , I like the comedies . They 're just light , too .
