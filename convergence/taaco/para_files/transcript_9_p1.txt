And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day , it always seems like I 'm doing that and I ca n't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry , you know , boxes of documents around , so , if I 'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing , you know , odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents , I dress down .

Yeah , and I 'll wear a dress and hose and stuff . Yeah , you know , we 're kind of that way too . I try to , I 'm the same way you are , I kind of try to judge from day to day . I know , you know , where I am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and , Uh-huh . and , you know , if I know that they 're going to be there , you know , you , I try to really watch it and like you say , you know , really dress up and if I know they 're not , you know , I , I 've been doing a lot of reorganization , you know , the last couple of months the same way you are , you know , Uh-huh . and it 's just MUMBLEx , it 's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress . That 's right , that 's right . It is and so ,
