but an aunt keeps the baby . Oh , that 's nice . But I would , I would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays , but I would imagine it 's very hard . I , I think so . I think it 's hard to find a good day care . I have worked in anoth- , at some other ones that were not very good -- Uh-huh . -- in my opinion . But this one that I 'm in now is , is very good . And one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children . Uh-huh .
