A , A ROSE FAMILY by Faulkner . That 's one of my favorites . I have never read a lot of Faulkner . Oh , and this , this is more of a play or something that , that it was from , that , that I saw and I read the book from that . Oh , cool . And , by the way , my name 's Bill . I 'm from North Carolina . I 'm Doug , I 'm from Pennsylvania . Uh , I , let 's see . What kind of books do you like to read ? Uh , well , a bunch of stuff , I guess , uh , fair number of novels , but mostly shorter ones . And , like , I do n't really like the , you know , six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that . I really have to be in the mood . Right ? I , I read one , like maybe once a year . Uh-huh . I 'm not as , No , like , I like , say , uh , Richard Broudigan a lot . Uh , I 've never read anything by him . Okay . He 's , uh , he 's dead now , but he was really a pretty amazing writer . He wrote books that were , like , pretty short and pretty easy to read , you know , like written at a third grade level or whatever . Yeah .
