we 'll try to catch some crab . So I got my chicken MUMBLEx and all my little net and everything , and something , I had a rock to weight it down , something grabs and just runs with it . And of course there 's no hook , so it ca n't be a fish . Uh-huh . I 'm sure it 's not a fish , right . And crab , they do n't bite like that , they do n't just run with your food . So , I netted it , and it was the ugliest fish I 've ever seen in my life .
