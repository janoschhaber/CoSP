Budgeting activity in our household I , has is , uh , uh , kind of an informal kind of situation . We , we , you know , put , actually what happens is , uh , is , my check gets automatically deposited . I do n't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore . It just gets deposited . And , and , and my , my wife , you know , you know , looks at all those bills that come in and , you know , and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them . You see , and so our , our budgeting , w- , we really do n't have a formal budgeting situation . Every time I 've ever tried one , it 's , uh , I 've just got wrapped in my inertia . And , uh , I 've just decided not to pursue it . Uh , what , what 's your budget situation ? Well , actually , uh , I 've , I 've had a couple of different situations . My current one has been the most successful . Uh , at a certain point in life an- , my husband , my ex-husband was an alcoholic . And we got divorced back in the mid-seventies and that left me with three teenagers . You know , well a- , a- , actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets . It certainly is . Is n't it ? But at any rate , what happened was that I , I just absolutely put away all the credit cards . I did n't rip them up . I did n't send them back . Nothing .
