Yeah . I have , uh , two daughters who , who both are in college or , in fact , one has finished now . But they both have a lot of credit cards . And they give you such high credit limits . Uh-huh . It 's , it 's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap . Uh , right . And then they , they give you , uh , uh , the credit limit , and then you 're always s- , seemingly up to that limit . Now I have quite a few credit cards that I 'm always almost up to the limit on most of them . And that 's , that 's how a lot of people get into trouble . Yeah . I 've got , I 've got two that I , you know , that usually I 'll have a balance on . Uh-huh . And then all of the others I just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card and , and pay it off every month . Right . And that way I feel like I 'm getting , you know , a thirty day loan . Yeah . But I do n't have to worry about , you know , running them up too high , except at Christmas . Then they usually go , then they usually get run up pretty good . Yeah . Well , you have a lot of discipline . I , uh , I 'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine . I , I 've , I 've paid off about four credit cards this year . Uh-huh . And , uh , but still I have some that are , are up to the limit . And especially the Visa Card -- Yeah . -- that you can go and get cash on . And it seems like every time I 'm short of cash , I just go get , get it from Visa . Now that 's one , that 's I 've never used my Visa for cash before . Uh-huh . Can you use it like at a bank machine j- , -- Uh , -- or , Well , uh , you can go in a bank and just hand them the Visa Card and say , `` I want a cash advance . ''
