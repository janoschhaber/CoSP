How easy . -- that 's my fav , that 's my favorite becau- , Right . And really at our point of life our children are grown and , uh , it has just worked out really well with this , uh , position he 's in . Uh-huh . Because I can go at a spur of the moment or what have you and it depends where he 's going whether or not I decide to go along -- Sure . -- but I do , do like to travel and it 's , uh , I do n't mind the pool life at all -- Uh-huh . -- during the day . And I like to sight see and I love to shop . Uh-huh . So it 's , So that 's perfect . What more could you ask for ? That 's right , but it , And then got to pick and choose the places . Well , and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas . Oh . Uh , that I would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas , uh , probably once every maybe year and a half . Uh-huh . And presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles -- Uh-huh . -- and so I 've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with Continental -- Uh-huh . -- and they 're recommending that you use those because they do n't know the future of Continental . Right , it 's kind of shaky . And I said now that we have all the miles , we better start using them . That 's true . Uh , It really is . So we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip . Uh , when we normally go that way , we like to go to California at the same time , because we really do n't get out there as often as you could probably -- Uh-huh . -- from Texas . Our last big trip , we drove through New Mexico and Colorado and went to the Grand Canyon and , and , uh , back through Silverton and Durango and , oh , it was fun . It was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it . Our , I think that 's a good trip . Uh-huh . And really , for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent .
