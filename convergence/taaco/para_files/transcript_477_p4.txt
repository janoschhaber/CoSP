So , -- I think the way it , uh , I think that 's the way it works now in basketball . You , you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers -- Yeah . -- and , you know , uh , Bird for the , for the , uh , Celtics and , And , you know , uh , you know , I used to think that , that one , one player really does n't make a club , but it really does , you know . Well , it MUMBLEx , You get somebody like Magic and you can see the decline in that team . Well , yeah . Once he left , you know , it 's , it 's just not the same , uh , it 's not the same team . There 's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for . Well , I think you 're right and I think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit and I think those things do make a difference and there are marquee players . And I think -- Oh , yeah . -- I think Jordan and the , and the Bulls have to be , uh , considered the likely favorites . I do n't know who would meet them in the west . Uh , I do n't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year .
