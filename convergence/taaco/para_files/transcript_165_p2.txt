as a country , the United States , uh , I think our hands are tied -- Uh-huh . -- as far as , as , as any further involvement , Yeah . until the U N sanctions it . In fact , it really was to begin with . Yeah . And , uh , I just , I heard a comment on the radio this morning that , uh , you know , it , it gets to a point where , uh , if enough people are , are going to be slaughtered over there over the , the , the internal problems , um , somebody may step in again . Uh-huh . But , uh , I really think it 's , it 's a U N issue , Yeah . at that point because it is internal . Well , you know the funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before , the American public goes crazy . Uh-huh . And now the fact that we 're not interfering with the internal rebellion in , in Iraq , they 're going crazy . That 's right , that 's right . You know , I mean you ca n't please them one way or the other . Absolutely right . You know , and I , and I think that , I , I agree with you , this is exactly the right course . I mean that 's an internal problem to Iraq . It has nothing to do with us . Uh-huh . And until he starts doing something so inhumane that the U N gets involved , then it 's nobody 's business . That 's right . Um , I mean these , these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time . All the time . I mean , yeah , I mean , Some of them have been going on for , for tens of years , Yeah . if , if I understand it right in places like the Sudan and , Yeah , and it 's certainly , and it 's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years . Yeah . And it 's going to continue . That 's right . As long as you have so many diverse groups that are , that are vying for power , it 's going to happen all the time .
