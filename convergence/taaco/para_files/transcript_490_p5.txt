Right . And that 's the sad part about it . Yeah . I , uh , yeah , and I think a lot of people who do it now . In Colorado it 's interesting . I talked to my mother . They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home . And my mother could make it on that . What she probably would do is disburse the money to me and then I would send it back to her so that 's what would happen . Uh-huh . I think that 's what most people do . You just have to give it , everything away .
