Right , right . So that would kind of give you a , a clue , I guess and , and sometimes you get the long term stuff so you 're aware ahead of time -- Yeah . -- of what 's going on . That , so that 's , and I do n't know , you know , I , I think about , well , the dress code they have for the kids , you know . Are they put one on the parents , or the teachers and say they have to , the men have to wear ties and there can be no blue jeans worn and , because some of the teachers I know wear , uh , dress up jeans , not sloppy looking jeans -- Uh-huh . -- but tapered jeans that they 've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease and , uh , you know , they 'll wear it with a nice top . And , and , uh , I do n't know that that looks that bad . But , if you 're going to tell the kids they c , have to dress up , I guess you can tell the teachers that , too . Yeah , it , it , I see that the , I think the elementary school teachers , or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than , than some of the high school teachers , I think . Uh-huh . But it , I think it varies , it , it just so much . Anything , anything can go . Uh-huh . And you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools , like history at Clark , they 're all pretty fancy . But they 're just sort of into clothes , and then there 's other departments -- Right . -- that are n't . Right , right . And they 'll just wear your common , ordinary , you know , whatever you might -- Yeah , there 's a couple -- -- might say , -- teachers up there that , that do dress up more than others . Right . Right .
