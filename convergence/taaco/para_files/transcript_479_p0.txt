Well , got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone there ? No , I do n't think there is any such thing , as a crime free zone any longer . I 'm afraid you 're right . Uh , one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought , oh , well , something 's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams and the next thing I know there are policemen all around my house . Oh , my . And they had stopped a , uh , b- , a stolen car -- Oh , boy . -- and caught one of the men in the hedge and then the other one was on the roof in the back . By your house ?
