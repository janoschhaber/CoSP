Yeah . Um , looking back , like maybe some of the things that I know now , I , I 'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives . That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about , because I , because we never went to war . I do n't think we were committed to winning it and getting out and I , Right . I feel like it went on and on . And I , I guess I see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had , where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for , for what was happening . Right . You know , I just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman and I 'm not sure that 's our role , but . Yeah , I , I agree with that , I was , I was fairly young at the time too , I , I really do n't have very many memories about it at all , in fact . Uh-huh . And , uh , my husband is a Vietnam veteran
