Hi Pat . Hi . One of the interesting things that I have considered about the role change for women is that women of my age , my generation , were trained and taught and brought up to be the LEAVE IT TO BEAVER housewives . Uh-huh . But we are not living in that world . We are certainly not , our families have changed . Uh-huh , families , uh-huh . Society has changed . Oh , yeah , sure . Everything has changed .
