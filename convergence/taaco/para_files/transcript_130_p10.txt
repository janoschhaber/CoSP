and I think , maybe , as you get outside the Dallas area , I kind of , I bet you it 's kind of what I decided . Well , maybe because it 's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better prices , plus I was going through that T I fleet discount program . Okay , did , did you use it at the car shop place . Well , it 's before they had that . Oh , okay . I had gone over to Texins and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the , in the fleet program , That 's right , yeah . and what you could expect , they said , you know , a five percent over cost -- Right . -- and then options at cost and everything . Right . So , I figured out a price based on that . Yeah , that 's good . But I , I guess I got a pretty good deal , because I went back to the Town North Mazda right off Central -- Uh-huh . -- and offered them the same price as what I knew I was going to be able to get it for in Arlington -- Right . -- and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price , especially if we add on the equalizer -- Yeah . -- and the cruise control . Yeah . He said , You 're going to get a car that 's got flood damage or hail damage . And they just laughed at me . And I went the next morning to Arlington , and they gave it to me for that price . And what 's so funny , they took the car , they , I knew they were going to pull it from Town North because that 's where the white one was . Is that right . And they had already told me , We located one at Town North . So it was that same car . My gosh . Yeah , well , unless you 're selling car with hail damage and flood damage , I got the car off your lot for that price . And you laughed all the way to the bank . Oh I did . And I laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand mile checkup -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , that they required you to do . And I took it to Town North , and sure enough I saw that guy , and he recognized me . Yeah . He said , Oh , hi , Dana ,
