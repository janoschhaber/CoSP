And , but WordPerfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways . And you , and it does a lot of things too that if you , if you do any kind of , uh , research or anything like that where you have to , uh , use footnotes , it is just wonderful . Oh . Because it keeps track of all your footnotes . Oh , that 's neat . Yeah , and if you add it , if you put a footnote in , in the middle , you know , if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it , you just change , um , it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you . Oh , how wonderful . So , you know , it 's just , That , I had heard that that was better . Yeah . That was a better one . Yeah . And I think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything , and oh , it was just awful . So , um , I do n't know I think we have just become really spoiled . But I think , Yeah . it 's a nice kind of way to be spoiled . Yeah , I agree . So , um , well , I have not really paid much attention because I clock , although I think we 've probably been talking at least ten minutes so , um , if you , um , unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with P C -s . Not too much . What kind of , what kind of things do you write ? Well , um , I was a technical writer for many years , um , Oh . and my husband and I actually met in a computer company . Um , I was a tech writer and he was an engineer . And , uh , so I did tech writing for a number of years . . Go talk to Daddy about it . Excuse me . Oh , sure . Go on and talk to Daddy about it . Tell Daddy I unplugged it for you . But you do n't need to drag it down the hall . Got a problem , huh ?
