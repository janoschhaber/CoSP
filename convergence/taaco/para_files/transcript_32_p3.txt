That 's sweet , I have the two , the other two cats I have are outdoor cats . Oh , uh-huh . And they did n't used to be actually , but they got kind of wild and were n't doing very well inside , so I put them outside once I got a house and they 're doing great out there , they love it . But the other one , the first one I got he does n't want anything to do with outside unless you 're there . Oh , uh-huh . Other than that he gets scared to death . If you shut that door he goes into hiding . Oh no . I think it 's from the time he jumped off the balcony . Yes , uh-huh , that 's it . And Lord knows what happened to him . He 's probably been through all kinds of nightmares . Right , traumatized for life here .
