as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position actually when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry , and I used to fill out those attitude surveys , Yeah . and , uh , uh , me and the insurance adjusters are , are very familiar with each other and my husband still works there , Yeah . and , um , I get my attitude expressed through them , but I find it to be very sometimes it 's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short- , MUMBLEx mentality to save a few bucks . This is true . Uh , and never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I and I came down here and , you know , they did an attitude survey like six weeks after I had been working here and I asked about , you know , day care for the shift workers , Yeah . and boy I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just do n't say that , you know , Well , it 's not , it was not applicable to me and I was kind of horrified . Now what year are we talking about ? We 're talking nineteen seventy-eight . Okay , uh , things have become much more enlightened since then . They could n't have gotten anymore in the dark ages .
