Uh-huh . I think maybe those people that really do need to work , both parents , just to survive . And -- Yeah . -- then there , th- , is , is that other group that is -- Uh-huh . -- working to maintain a standard of living -- Okay . -- that , uh , they think is , is surviving which is really more luxuries . Uh-huh . Uh , but I I tend to think that it 's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive . Yo- , so you think it 's , which group are you saying is the one trying ? I 'm saying that the , uh , the group that is just trying to survive from day to day , where both parents are working -- Uh-huh . -- is more of the majority than the , than the people that have the higher standard of living . Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing , uh , middle class in this country -- Uh-huh . -- I think that that 's , in my opinion , the case . Okay . So . I mean I have met people that , uh , both that , that just want to maintain a , the standard of living and those that , that really need the job . Okay . And then , sometimes I , I often , uh , find that maybe there 's so many different things available to us . Yo- , a microwave , a V C R , a answering machine -- Uh-huh . -- a , you know , a special , a dishwasher , uh , a refrigerator and some of those items , um , for the , for the , uh , well I guess we 're sticking more to social changes but , uh -- Uh-huh . -- people want all of that and not all of those are necessities . Right .
