I should know but , I do n't , I 'm sorry . But Kentucky , we use to have severe , I mean , just real cold , cold winters -- Uh-huh . -- and we 'd have three and four feet of snow . Course here in Texas they do n't have snow , they do n't know what snow is . They freak out when there 's snow on the ground . Uh-huh . Originally I 'm from Texas so , I mean Amarillo . So , uh , Oh , Amarillo ?
