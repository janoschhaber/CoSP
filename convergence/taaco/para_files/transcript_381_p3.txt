Oh , yeah that too , two years ago , or last Christmas -- Yeah , yeah . -- is that what you 're talking about ? Yeah , I 'm still -- Yeah , uh-huh . -- I 'm still replacing that in the back , especially , under the trees -- Uh-huh . -- uh , you know , kind of slow , and , as you say , very expensive . Yeah . I caught Wolfe with , uh , uh , one , uh , one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents , and , uh -- Oh , yeah . -- I bought about twenty of them . I guess you did too . It 's what they 've done in the spring -- Uh , well , I put , you know -- -- or the fall . -- that was late , that was like , Yeah , because I started to say , you can , there 's different times they say it 's okay to do it . Yeah , that was like September , I think . Yeah . And I had to water it , you know -- Yeah -- -- gosh . -- keep it damp . Well , my , out here , you know , we do n't have as many trees in Plano , at least the area where , we 're over by Collin Creek Mall , and , but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front , like the pittosporum all died , and all those variegated , uh , things died . So we pretty much go with that dwarf Yaupon and that Yaupon holly , and they just live , Yeah , they 're pretty tough , uh , Yeah , you can , you can stand those . Pittosporum is kind of borderline here -- Uh-huh . -- and usually it 'll do pretty well , but , uh , you know , every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals -- Yeah . -- and it zaps it .
