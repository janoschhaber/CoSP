Well , tell me about your home . Okay . Uh , right now we 're living in , well it 's me , my wife and , uh , two young boys . And , uh , right now we 're in a , uh , I guess it 's either a zero lot line or a garden home . Uh-huh . Which you might call it . So we do n't have a , a big yard . Uh , but , uh , when my wife and I first moved in , it was just the two of us . So it was enough . Uh-huh . Uh , and it 's , uh , I guess what they call a story and a half . Because it 's not a full two story . Yeah . Where , you know , everything on top is on bottom . So , it 's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings . Huh . And , uh , it 's about a five year old house now . It sounds nice . It 's , uh , pretty nice . Unfortunately , the builder who built it went out of business already . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . It was a , Landmark is the one who built it . Yeah . Well , you know , these guys that gambled high -- Yeah . -- lost big you know . That 's true . And , uh -- Exactly what happened to them . -- I 'm insulating myself from that problem . I 'm building my own house . Oh , that 's nice . And as I look out the window of my trailer , I can envision all the insulation that 's going up today . Oh , really . Yeah . Are you doing it yourself ? Yeah . Wow . I used to be a builder . Oh , that 's nice . And I retired about five years ago and -- Oh , I see . -- started college . Huh . And now I 'm a college educated builder MUMBLEx . There 's still no work , you know . Yeah . So , uh , you know , I decided this summer that , uh , you know , we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so I did . That 's great .
