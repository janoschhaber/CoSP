if I walk into a bad neighborhood I 'm sure I 'd want to walk through with you because I 'm sure you have good , you know , fa- , far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything . Um , I 'm , quite concerned that if you let everyone has n't yet used a gun in a , have n't , has n't yet committed a felony , if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario , you 're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature . You 're going to start getting a lot of gunfire . It 's , it 's hard for me to imagine that a , a situation of , you know , take it to a logical extreme , if everyone walking around carrying a guns you 're not going to have an increase in gunfire . I , actually it 's no- , it 's more of a police action in itself , the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying , well , I 'm going to mug this guy right here but hey , he 's carrying just as much firepower as I can . And if they 're sca , if you got to go through a certification course to get where , to where you can carry it in public , Uh-huh . then this individual also knows this guy 's pretty good with it . Now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not , Uh-huh . that 's another trip , Uh-huh but . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . In defense of myself , defense of my family or defense of my friends I can blow somebody a way in a heart beat . Uh-huh . Even , even more so when it comes to my , my wife and son . Yeah , Anybody , I know , anybody tries to hurt them I wo n't even blink , No .
