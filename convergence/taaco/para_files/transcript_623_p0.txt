I 'm Nevin from Sunnyvale , California . Hi , this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis , Minnesota . How you doing ? Pretty good . Good . Uh , I guess the topic is trial by jury and -- Yep . -- how we should change that or how we would change it . Uh , I 'm ready whenever you are . Okay . So , uh , what are your , what are your thoughts on the subject there ? Well I definitely think , like decisions have to be unanimous . Yeah . Yeah , I think that 's probably a good thing . It 's probably the safest thing . Yeah . I mean , it 's to easy to get a quorum -- Yep . -- and simple majority wo n't do . No . And even like , you know , two-thirds majority , I mean , it 's , Yeah , that 's , yeah , quorums are to easy to get . Yep . And there 's always that , that chance that one or two people could be playing devil 's advocate for a good reason , you know . So it 's , it 's -- -- definitely but , uh , I do n't know . I could , I could n't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing . Yeah . Like Gives them a little too much power . Yeah . Tha- , I , I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that . Or arguing against that pretty vehemently . But , uh , Plus , you know , you may be , you know , doing , you know , a , a guilty verdict but it may not be , you know , it may be for technical reasons . Yeah . About the only good thing I would say about that is it w- , that it would , uh , hurry the process up a bit -- Yeah . -- but I mean even now we 've got , I know we 've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that and -- I know MUMBLEx . -- that 's what the trial by jury . I mean , jeez if , if the judge was doing it himself , without any checks and balances -- Yeah . -- whose to say . It , there would be much more of that . Yeah no doubt . Are you involved in the legal system at all ?
