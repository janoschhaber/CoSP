-- uh , I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and -- Uh-huh . -- everything else , and I totaled them all up and basically , uh , we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax . Wow . Now , that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every , for every item on there -- Uh-huh . -- even though there 's , uh , taxes on different things . Well is n't , But , you know , there 's f- , there 's a lot of taxes you pay that you 're not even aware of that you 're paying , uh , like when you buy a tire , you pay a federal excise tax . Uh-huh , there 's a lot , yeah , lot of hidden taxes . You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your , your -- Uh-huh . -- tank . The taxes that people do n't think about that , yeah , the , the , the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay , I guess . But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes . Uh-huh . There was that , which can- , was it Jerry Brown , one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the , the tax codes they have now and implementing a f , I think a flat percentage , something like that . Yeah , if you impl , implemented a flat percentage , it would encourage people , uh , to make more money and the , what people need to understand in my opinion , now this is just my opinion , okay , uh , is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes . Uh-huh . And , so , if they penalize businesses , business people are smart enough to say , here 's my break point , I 'm not going to work any harder -- Right . -- and make any more or create any more jobs . Exactly .
