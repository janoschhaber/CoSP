So I think there 's a lot of people that have , you know , really , I guess that you 'd call it really sport fishing , they 're really into it to try to win . Yeah , oh , definitely . My . Certainly here they are . But it is , it 's very , a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around . The peace and calmness is really relaxing . Yeah , it 's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish . Uh-huh . That 's what I do a lot . I 've never tried taking a book with me . I 'll have to try that one of these days .
