The one we went in had , uh , the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that , like a kid 's place area . Uh-huh , yeah . That really seem , they really seemed to go wild in there . Yeah , yeah they had a lot of fun in there and , uh , there 's , uh , there 's some petting , you know , like , uh , uh , I think it 's Owens Country Farms has a free petting , you know , like a farm that you can go to
