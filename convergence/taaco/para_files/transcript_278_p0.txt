All right , do you do exercise ? I do , yes , I , uh , uh , I guess it actually changes , I do a number of different things -- Uh-huh . -- simply walking with my wife -- Right . -- and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle . Uh , and then moving up , I run -- Uh-huh -- in the mornings , not every morning , it probably averages about two days a week -- Right . -- and then with my wife I actually go to the gym and lift weights , which is n't , I understand , quite exercising , but it 's along the lines , Right . How about yourself . Well , um , that 's a hard question to answer because I do physical things , but I do n't always set out for them to be exercise . Uh-huh . I walk with my parents , occasionally , nothing 's real regular about this because I have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule , and , um , I play racquetball , but I have n't since I 've been out of school . I do n't have anywhere to do that , but that 's going to start soon again --
