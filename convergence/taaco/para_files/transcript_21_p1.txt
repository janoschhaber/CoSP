Well , uh , the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time , are crafts and , uh , I 've been involved in making , uh , hat stands and , uh , rag dolls and , uh , different type hats with , uh , flowers and roses , you know , and , uh , that kind of thing , straw hats and , Oh . all that kind of stuff . And I enjoy it , it 's relaxing . And you kind of get absorbed in it so the time goes by , you know , before you realize anything is going on . And I play the organ sometimes , uh , just for my own satisfaction . Not for anybody else 's ears because I 'm not that good at it , but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while . Oh really ? How about yourself ? Well , oh , hobbies , gee whiz , I guess I got too many hobbies so I never have time to deal with them . Really ? I like photography a lot , Oh , yeah , that 's neat . uh , I used to do that a lot and then I like , um , we have a new child that will be a year old here next week , so I 'll take a lot of pictures of her , Oh , that 's great ,
