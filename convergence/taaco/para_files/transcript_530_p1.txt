Uh-huh . They do n't ever have to go out and get a real job . They just -- Uh-huh . -- stay in their current job , you know what I mean ? I agree , uh , with , with both of those things , but , uh , do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest ? I think by putting term limitations on you could , you could slow down some of the problems . Uh-huh . Uh , but it has to be not just at the national level but at the , you know , the state and the local level , too . I know some senators , and I do n't know which ones , but they 've been in office since the , the nineteen forties -- Uh-huh . -- and I , th- , they 've never had a job . I mean they 've never gone out in the real world and , and paid normal taxes . Um . I know they pay taxes , but they do n't -- Yeah . -- you know , they , they get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year . Uh-huh . Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and , you know , I 'm going , like , I , I do n't understand how they 're supposed to be my servants and yet they 're paid more than I am -- Uh-huh . -- and they work less , you know , less than I do . Uh-huh . Uh , the only prob- , the only problem I see with term limitations , uh , is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in , with most governments is just so complex that there 's a very lar , you know , there , there is a learning curve and that , you know , you d- , ca n't just send someone off to Washington and expect , you know , his first day to be an effective , uh , Congress person . Uh , I think , I think there really is a , there 's a lot they need to learn , you know , when you get there . I think , I think that 's true ,
