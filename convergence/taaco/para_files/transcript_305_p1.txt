Well , we do s- , some dining out . Um , I , I do a lot of cooking so , um , mostly like when we go out , you know , it 's my husband and I , I , we do n't go out too often as a family , um , unless it 's like a fast-food kind of thing . But , um , but we do enjoy dining out . One of our favorite places here in , in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe . I do n't know if you , have you ever been there ? I 've heard of that but I have n't been there . Um , where , about is that ? Um , well actually there 's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific , and , uh , Oh , okay . I , I 've been to Cafe Pacific . Have you ? Th- , now that 's down in , uh , Highland Park . Right . It 's Highland Park Village . Did you like it ? Yes . Uh , Oh , I love it . Before we moved to , the area , my brother , uh , lived in Dallas for a number of years and we came up one time when my father was visiting and -- Uh-huh . -- we all ate there and , oh , their seafood was wonderful . Oh , it is , it 's fabulous . It really is a great place . Now where is the Atlantic Cafe ? Atlantic Cafe is down on , I believe it 's on McKinney . Oh , okay . Um , and o- , originally the two , the , the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and th- , the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe , were partners in the Atlantic Cafe . And then they , they separated and the guy started Cafe Pacific . And , I loved them both . I really do . I think they 're wonderful . That 's our favorite . You know what we 'd really like , if , if we just have a , a casual evening is Houston 's . Have you been there ? No , um , but I 've heard that 's really good , too ,
