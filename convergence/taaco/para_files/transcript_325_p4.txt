Two bits I 'll get a man to talk to me , because they get stuck doing it all . But although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work . And this year we put in a new lawn in a new home so , um , we 've been fighting a drought here this summer -- Huh . -- and getting into fall . Today we just had a lot of rain . Oh , really ? Yeah , so it 's kind of nice . I do n't know how yours has been . Well , it 's been real hot here lately . I mean we 've had to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything but , uh , doe , it 's supposed to rain again now , uh , this weekend . Oh , I see . So , then , Okay . Well , we 're leaving tomorrow
