Oh , yeah . You know , the , the little joke about , will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light . Oh , well , it 's a nice place , you know , I mean it 's , it 's a nice , that 's a nice place , though . Well , you know , I , I said I lived in , uh , the Pontiac . I did n't live in the city of Pontiac , I lived to the west of it . Uh , I forget the , the county , but you know where all the lakes are around there . Okay , sort of . I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes . It was real close to where I worked . It was only like four miles to work and it was wonderful being on the lake like that . You know , in the summer , you feel like you 're , you know , on a vacation all the time because you 're right on a lake and everybody 's , you know , out enjoying the water and such , and , uh , in the winter time the lakes froze over , you could still kind of go sledding and such out there but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes . There 's lots of really small ones out there . Yeah . You know , like maybe a mile , two long . Yeah . That 's enough to , uh , do some boating --
