Which had a , you know , capital case in it . And , uh , m- , I personally have , uh , my own feelings about , uh , capital punishment is I think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony . I do , too .

And if you 're black and you kill a black guy , you know , it 's , you know , two hundred hours of community service . Yeah ,
