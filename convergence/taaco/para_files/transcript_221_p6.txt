so , Yeah . you know , you create a bigger , bigger family , generation after generation but not really on purpose . Yeah . So . It 's not , not a real functional situation anyway . So , you know , I do n't know it 's , I do n't know that that trend 's going to change the single parent type families and the MUMBLEx families , as long as we 've got so many other crazy things going on in society . Yeah , I , I think that eventually the , the family unit 's just not going to even exist anymore . MUMBLEx like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that I think there 's going to be more single parent families than there are , um , you know , two parent families . Uh-huh . That 's pretty sad . Yeah , it is , I guess unless , unless there 's a , a major swing in the change of what 's important to people , you know , probably keep going downhill . And I , I do n't know we , we feel like that , that we can make it on one income it , it may be tough but we may have to give up on some , some things . I , I think in the long run though your child will benefit from that . Yeah . And it will , it will make the , the strain worthwhile . Yeah , I think so too . Well , I , I need to go ahead and , and wrap it up . Okay . Um , it was really nice talking to you . Well , I 've enjoyed it , Stephanie . And , uh , thanks a lot . Uh-huh . Okay , bye-bye . Bye-bye .
