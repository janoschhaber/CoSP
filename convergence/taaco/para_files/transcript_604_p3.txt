So the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and , and competing and , of course , the competing itself , really did n't matter what it was , it was making the friends and going all the places and it was a really neat experience , but it took our total time . I did not work , uh , when I did this . Now I do work full-time . Uh-huh . And it 's just , my thirteen year old and myself and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other .

Uh , but I do n't know how my father did it . He worked at a truck line
