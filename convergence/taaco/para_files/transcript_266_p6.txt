I did n't care for the type of movie , but he was always slick , and greasy , and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed and I did n't like him . But , he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older . Yeah , I thought he looked real good with a beard , too . Oh , yeah , yeah , he does and there is just a , there 's a , I do n't know , uh , I think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning , whether he is or not . Yeah . And he , he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time . And , I enjoy those , and I enjoy some of the Michael J . Fox movies . I did n't care too much for the last one either . It just was not enough to it .
