Uh , the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a , uh , long term financial plan and monthly budget . The only thing I do now is , uh , put the data into Quicken . I do n't know if you are familiar with that . Yeah , I have some friends of mine who use Quicken and , uh , I 've considered using it once myself , but I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date . Uh-huh . So I , I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken , at least for now . Um . I 've found it 's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then , well , uh , uh , not bother to total it -- Uh-huh . -- and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic . So it really helps with that .
