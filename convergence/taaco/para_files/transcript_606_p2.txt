Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still . Right . They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her but they wanted to be independent as well . Right . Have their own room . My grandmother actually was in a , a nursing home that , uh , there was a retirement hotel and then a , uh , there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it so for , uh , the first few years she had her own apartment and , you know , made her own meals sometimes . But could , could also go and eat someplace else . Uh-huh . And then , uh , as she became less able to take care of herself , then she moved into this other part that was able to , uh , provide full-time care and , uh , she did n't have to do anything anymore . But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly . And that 's som- , I do n't know whether that 's because they , you know , sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the , the reason is . But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something . Well a lot of it 's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help . Yeah . They need health care so they 're already ill before they go . Right . That 's probably a large factor .
