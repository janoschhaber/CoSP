I mean they 're exposed to a whole lot more things . They have a whole lot more , uh , variety of things they they 're , that they see and do at an earlier age , so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time , but , but still , I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to , to teach , uh , basic values and basic , uh , respectful of , uh , -ness of authority . Right .
