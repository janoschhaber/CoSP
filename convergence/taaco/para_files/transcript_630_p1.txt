Uh-huh . She received a bill from them , uh , that she had visited some sto- , and , and I think it was there in Florida , maybe it was in Miami . That , uh , she had visited a store there and , uh , they had this bill , uh , that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise , uh , over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise . Uh-huh . Uh , and the date that , that she supposedly made this purchase , she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving . Uh-huh . Uh , and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number . Uh-huh . Uh , and , and I 've , I 've heard recently that , uh , uh , that this is a common occurrence where people are using s- , you know , they use Joe Blow 's so , uh , social security number , uh , and can , uh , potentially ruin someone 's credit . Uh-huh .
