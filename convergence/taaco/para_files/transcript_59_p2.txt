Well , we seem to , uh , to favor certain , uh , uh , countries particularly South American countries . And , uh , there is no , uh , uh , I have nothing , of course , against , uh , the , uh , the South Americans or , uh , or Hispanics , in that sense , but I think we , uh , are more restrictive of the , uh , so called eastern , uh , European countries than we , uh , we should be . Of course , that 's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern Europe , so . Oh . And , uh , so I think , uh , you know , the , uh , embargo we placed on the , uh , on the Russian Jews , although we MUMBLEx of , uh , spent years and years , uh , lobbying for their release and their ability to , um , immigrate from Russia -- Uh-huh . -- as soon as that occurred , we simply said that , uh , instead of the , uh , hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country , we cut that by , uh , two thirds . So . Huh . I do not quite go along with that , but . No , that does n't make a whole of lot sense . No . And I still think , you know , again , kind of having , uh , uh , within this century , come from a , uh , an immigrant family , or immigrant families on both sides . Uh-huh . Both my mother 's parents and my father 's parents were immigrants so , I 'm a little touchy every now and then about that . Yeah . Well , uh , my , uh , my family is from , uh , Europe from , well , from England and Ireland -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , have been in this country for , oh , more than a hundred and fifty years -- Oh , my . -- almost two hundred years , so , I do n't have any , any , uh , relatives that I am , or , or , uh , several generations back , that I am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family . They were all , they were all born here -- Uh-huh . -- so I do n't have any real strong ties with any , with , with the immigration laws . I do n't , because I do n't , I do n't have any personal feelings about them and I have n't taken the time or effort to learn what they are . Well , I think in a way , though , uh , uh , I also have , uh , an opposite point of view , which is , uh , although I believe we should , uh , permit , uh , you know , constant immigration into this country -- Um . -- uh , I think we should , uh , primarily for economic reasons , I think we should have , um , some quotas , of course , my family and I , again , again that was , you know , my grandparents came over during the time when , uh , there were quotas . So they had to wait , uh , you know , in , uh , certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over . Uh-huh . So , you know , but , uh -- Yeah . I , I , -- I think unrestricted immigration , I think , is not , uh , is not best , uh . Well , I agree with that , I , I think if immigration was entirely unrestricted , uh , not only would , would the United States become over populated , well , more over populated awfully quickly , I think it , it would bring in a lot of , uh , people that are , run out of other countries or in trouble in , in other countries . I think they 'd come here trying to find a new market for their , their brand of crime . Uh-huh . Well , you know , there 's another aspect of this , too . They 're also , uh , uh , diminishing the , uh , health restrictions which , I was not aware , aware of that . Well , yes . There are , were some , uh , regulations over , I do n't know whether they 're laws passed or , or whatever they 're called , uh , just recently , where , uh , people with certain diseases can not be excluded , uh , from , uh , immigration . Age is one , for example , and , uh , recently , uh , tuberculosis , which at one time , if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country -- Uh-huh . -- uh , they dropped that also . So I think in , in some as- , some ways we are , uh , becoming a little too egalitarian in that , in that sense , but , uh , I think we should be a little more circumspect about it . Again , my opinion . Yeah . Think we 've talked long enough ? I think so .
