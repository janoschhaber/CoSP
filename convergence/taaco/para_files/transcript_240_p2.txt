pushing all their cards . when it 's , when it 's very useful , Yeah . like , uh , emergency trip , Yeah . or something . Sometimes when you , when you , the money will be available , but it 's , you know , not immediately handy . I think , uh , they 're very helpful , plus the fact that it 's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes . Right . But , uh , I , you really do need to be very , um , oh , responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble . Yeah . I made that mistake when I first got a job and that 's kind of like , it took me quite a while to pay them off , Uh-huh . so af- , after that I decided , well , I 'm not going to use them at all , and just try to pay cash for everything and that worked for a while and then we got married so we decided to , you know , if we used them we would pay them off as we go . Right . So , Right . That can be very handy under those kind of circumstances . The other thing about them is too , if you really do n't , you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed , and have n't developed a credit thing .

But , uh , it 's true , you have to be very careful or you end up , uh , going in the deep end and , uh , and an awful lot of people are in trouble . Uh-huh .
