use that or , you know , there 's other consequences rather than killing them , you know , you could , Oh . always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against . Huh-uh . You know . Yeah . At least they might get some benefit in that , and if the people they committed a crime against , feel , at some later date , that these people have learned their lesson , are , are okay , you know , well , they can free them . Huh-uh . But , uh , you know , with the technology we have today , you can put a collar on a guy 's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property . I mean , it will just in incapacitate them . Huh-uh . And , you can put a collar around a guy 's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act . Huh-uh . But , you know , putting them in prison , my God , that does n't work . No , apparently not , because look how many years they 've been doing that and look , I mean , yeah . Well , you look at places like Turkey . Turkey has the death penalty , Huh-uh . for just about everything . Huh-uh . I mean , if you get convicted of , uh , you know , drug trafficking , they just kill you . You get convicted of , uh , you know , heinous crimes , they just kill you . I mean there 's no two ways about it . Huh-uh . And , uh , you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few . You know , and you look at our society , almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison , has been in prison three or four times . Three or four times , yeah . I mean , That is true , I know . Yeah . You know , the way to stop that kind of behavior is , is two-fold . One , you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven .
