I 've never actually done any , uh , like tent camping , Uh , that can be a lot of fun , too . Yeah . How about you ? Well , so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping . Uh-huh . This summer we went to , uh , the Smokey Mountain National Park . Oh , how great . And , uh , stayed about three or four days in there . It was wonderful . Oh , yeah . Nights were cool enough to where they 're comfortable . Um . And the days were nice and warm and , it was beautiful , beautiful few days . Uh-huh . That 's great . It worked out particularly well , especially considering she was , what , six months pregnant . Uh-huh . So , I do n't know , it worked pretty well . It was one of those , uh , those , dome type pop up tents . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Nice and quick and easy to put up . Yeah . Packs away nice and small and , about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto . Well , that 's true , that 's true . It was a lot of fun .

Yeah , it 's gorgeous , I love the big trees . Just , just the drive up through , uh , up the coast line -- Yeah . -- and then cut over in , into the , into the parks , it 's gorgeous , though .
