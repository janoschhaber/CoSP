I tend to get a little bit of ways in a book and then I , I get distracted , and , or have to start on another one , it 's pretty tough to keep up with . I was trying to think of , I , I 've got a copy of THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED but I was trying to think , there 's another Scott MUMBLEx book that I 've got that I had read . Uh , He , he also wrote PEOPLE OF THE LIE . Yeah , that 's the one I was thinking of . Yeah . I , I bought that one , and I did n't get into , involved in that one as well . There 's another one he wrote that even sounds better , and it 's kind of the whole concept of global peace , you know , like , and communities -- Uh-huh . -- building communities .
