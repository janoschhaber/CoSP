Okay , well what do you think ? Well , I 'm kind of leaning towards , I do n't know , I 'm thinking about what , from one to ten what my no would be . It would probably be somewhere closer to , uh , less control because I do n't see , I 'm not a member of the N R A although my , father is . Uh-huh . But , I guess I believe , I think the N R A has gone overboard the wrong way . You know , Yeah . they 're sitting there on number ten , they 're saying absolutely no gun control , we do n't even want to think about it and , and I think that 's a dumb , Yeah . situation .
