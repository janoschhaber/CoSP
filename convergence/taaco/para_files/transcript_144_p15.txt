Yeah . So , I mean , I could n't give an accurate , I could n't tell my kids what , you know , those people were like , I just remember they had some funny stories , but I do n't know who it was . Maybe what you could do if you could n't get into a full family reunion , Uh-huh . and you wanted to go back some , but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents , Yeah . then you can find out from , you know , you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these ,
