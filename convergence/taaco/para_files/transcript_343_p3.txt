Oh . -- so , I do n't , we do n't go there that much . Where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out , or a big meal ? A nice meal , oh , Where do you go for steaks ? It 's usually when we 're out of town -- Oh . -- and I 'll order steak or steak and lobster combined -- Uh-huh . -- so it 's really not in town . Oh . You ever been to Houston 's on Belt Line ? No . That 's where we go to get steaks -- Uh-huh . -- they have a teriyaki steak there , and when we have something to celebrate , we head to Houston 's . They do n't take reservations , and you wind up waiting about an hour -- Uh-huh . -- but the food is good , and they 've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink , unless you get there at five o'clock , then you can go right through . Right . But they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks , so , that 's our nice place to go . We do n't usually take the kids when we go there , But well , we do n't go out that much , I gue , well , I guess we do go out without kids . We 're usually picking things up quickly , though -- Yeah . -- we just do n't dwell on food too much ,
