Yes , it is . I , and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by . My husband has n't quit , yet . And he knows he has to and he knows he should and he knows and he knows , Um . but he has n't . I do respect the fact , though , that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me . He , he 's very conscious of , of passive smoking and he 's concerned about it but , Well , has n't quite made it yet . Well , when I was still smoking , I , I felt that way .
