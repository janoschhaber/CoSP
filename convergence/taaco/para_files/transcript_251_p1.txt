and that is all we have been doing all weekend . You know what ? It seems like we are doing it here forever . We bought a , a large house that was completely unlandscaped . I mean , it , it was pro- , probably was up to your shoulder in , in thistles . That was all that was there . Uh-huh . And we hired a professional landscaper to do it . And I have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted or the plants do not make the winter time . And so I am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year , Uh-huh . probably through the Fall too . And , uh , rip up , rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires , uh , more care than I am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies . Uh , how many kids do you have ? Just two , Okay . but they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more . What year , I mean , how old are they ? Four and five . Four and five . Goodness . Uh-huh . I have got a four year , uh , a four year old and a four month old . And an eight year old stepdaughter . Oh , well , I have a twenty six year old stepson , and I do not know if that counts . Well , you do not have to tend to him . Well , I did for many years . So , Oh , you did . Okay . It is over with . Yeah . He is gone .
