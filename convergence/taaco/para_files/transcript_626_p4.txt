A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there . Uh-huh . And he 's doing an internship with I B M . Oh . And , uh , they , basically , uh , did the same exact thing . Uh , we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time . So , one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process . But , uh , Did , do they test you at , right now , at work too ? No , no . That 's -- Okay . -- one thing they do n't do is , is drug testing while you 're on the job . Uh , I think , I think the unwritten rule is , yeah , expect it but they do n't do it . Oh . You know , so . That 's good I guess . I do n't know . I mean , I , uh , I have gone to a couple of parties since , since that time and while I do n't do any drugs myself , I 've seen some people who work there , uh , you know , smoking a joint or whatever . Uh-huh . And , uh , you know , that 's the kind of thing that would definitely come up , you know . But no , they do n't , they do n't really do that . So . Wow . Is it formal policy that they said they might test ?
