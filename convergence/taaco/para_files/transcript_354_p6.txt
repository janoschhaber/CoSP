Yeah , that 's true . I agree with you there . Yeah . So I do n't know , uh , because I , I need to have it tuned , you know , tuned up and I do n't know , replace some of the belts . And I was looking at the , uh , tires need to be replaced and so I was thinking just a lot of money I 'm , might as well buy me a new car for that . Yeah , I got new tires last winter too so I 'm like , well , that 's the last major purchase for this thing . It 's not worth it . Uh-huh . Well , you have to , in Pennsylvania , boy , you have to really have your car winterized and stuff , huh ? Yeah . Uh-huh . Yeah , we get some killer winters up here in the mountains . Oh , really ? Yeah . Oh , okay . So , Lot of snow and a lot of cold . Uh-huh . Well , especially do n't you have what , a lot of salt on the ground ? Yeah , at times there 's a lot of it . Uh-huh . You got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance . Yeah . Yeah , well , rust and the , and the body too , huh ? Yeah , I have n't had a big problem with that though . Uh-huh . So I 've been pretty lucky there . Well , I think they get the new Z-bart stuff and everything to where you can , um , Yeah , that 's usually pretty good . You just rinse it off after the winter is over and -- Uh-huh . -- done with it . Yeah , and go like that so .
