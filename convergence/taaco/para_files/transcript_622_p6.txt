Boy , we really got to know the kids well . I imagine . And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them . Oh , yeah . In -- I , -- fact , they were all in , uh , over the weekend for Easter . Oh , that 's wonderful . See I was raised in that type of family where , you know , you do n't disobey me , you mind me but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it , you can always come back and talk to me about it . Well , we did too . Yeah . And I remember the one daughter saying , we had a , a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree -- Uh-huh . -- and she said , hey I do n't make fun , fun of your friends so why make fun of mine ? Uh well . Kind of r- , kind of hit us between the eyes . Yeah , yeah . You do n't think of it that way do you . No . But that , that was always good quality time for us . Now that 's good . I like -- And then -- -- that idea . -- never attend , but if , if they missed it , they had to abide by the rules . Whatever was voted on , huh . Yeah and boy , they , they 'd show up . Well I think that 's great . And we 'd usually take notes -- Yeah . -- and , you know , the younger kids , uh , or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another . Yeah . And , uh , but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us . And they loved it . I , I think that 's true .
