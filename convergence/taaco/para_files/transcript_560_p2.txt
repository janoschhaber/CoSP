so I do n't need a , a mini van or such to , uh , haul people around in . Uh-huh . So I 'm looking for more a , a two passenger car that , uh , Oh , like a Miata or something like that ? Well , I like the Miata , but I do n't like it enough to buy it . I would buy something , actually the , the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon , which is an American car . Um . But , uh , something along that lines . Interesting . Uh , because I have a , an economy car right now , which is okay , but -- Yeah . -- uh , I think I , I 'd like to move on to something a little better . That 's interesting . Yeah , I guess probably the factors we 'd use to compare are a little different because I look for , you know , size and -- Right . -- safety , and then mileage . Probably , Right . Uh , That 's , when I bought the car that I bought , I was looking for mileage , and I was looking for , uh , dependability and something that was going to last a long time . I was g , that I would get a , for the money that I was going to spend , that I would get a return that was , that was worth that money . Yeah . So , Yeah I c- , I think in terms of computer terminology , I look at , you know , price performance and things like that . Right , exactly . And then a little bit at life expectancy , I guess , but it , you know -- Yeah . -- depends on what you , what you pay initially . But , you know -- That 's right . -- I 've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger . Actually -- Uh-huh . -- it was my wife 's car that she brought into the marriage and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton . Uh-huh . It 's , you know , we , we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles , but -- Uh-huh . -- uh , the other ninety four thousand have been just fine ,
