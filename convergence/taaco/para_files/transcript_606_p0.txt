Do you know anyone that , uh , is , is in a nursing home or has ever been in one ? No . But I , my grandparents were looking into it before so I know what they 've said . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , I 'm trying to think . My , uh , uh , wife 's grandmother had Alzheimer 's and they were going to put her into a , a nursing home and , uh , they , when they put her in , she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a , a , you know , a , a nuisance . Or worse than a nuisance , I mean -- Oh they thought it was too much of a bother .
