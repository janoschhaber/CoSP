It is very difficult . Like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers and , so , I do n't know . I think there needs to be more places and also I have a real strong opinion . In Iowa , the state I am from -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I believe it has gone up to a dollar now . Every time you buy a container , no matter what it is , whether it is glass , whether it 's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever , you pay ten cents for it -- Yeah . -- and then you take it back to the store and you get it back . Uh , so that way it kind of forces you to recycle . You are forced to . And , uh , you also do n't see the litter there . People just , Yeah , that 's true . It makes it worthwhile to take it back and I 've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian , I do n't know if you 've tried it -- Yeah , I have seen them . -- and they have on the ba- , it 's five cents , that they pay five cents -- Uh-huh . -- and it even shows the states that , That take them back . Yeah . Well , on- , some of them are five , some are ten cents . I am looking at it right now . Is Texas one of them ? Texas is not one of them see . So , I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass . Yeah . No , I do n't think that there is enough being done . Now , I work at J C PENNY at their corporate headquarters . Uh-huh . And we have a paper recycling program that , uh , is company wide and I do the recycling for that . Do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper . Yeah . Good . Because there is a lot of waste there is n't there . Yeah . And I know there is a lot of computer paper -- Right . -- that you ca n't use . Right . But , uh , we use to have , uh , I mean , I do n't even remember how much money that they 've , uh , I mean , the money that they 've made from the recycling program . They have donated it to charities . Right . I mean -- Yeah . -- they have made a substantial amount of money from it .
