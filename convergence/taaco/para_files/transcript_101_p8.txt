Yeah . I got , I got my Buick as a high school graduation gift . Did you ? Yeah . But I , I guess this was n't really an impulse , I mean , buying it right then and , you know , right quickly was kind of impulsive but I 'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years and I was just scared to . Right . I was scared to start taking on payments because the Buick was long since paid for . Right . That 's the same with me . Would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself ? Buy a , wha , ar , you , Like , buy a used car ? Right . Sure . I , I was going to buy one once but I just , I worry about who 's driven them and what they 've been through and the warranties and things like that . Yeah . Just , I ca n't seem to get over that . That just bothers me I do n't know why . Well , um , like on Hondas they , supposedly , the maintenance records was supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff .
