Um , I think we should permit , uh , more immigration from eastern Europe , for example , uh , particularly the , uh , the Jewish , uh , , uh , people from Russia . I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last , uh , several years . And , I think we have , uh , uh , too much restriction on the , uh , on the Orientals also , but , of course , that 's just my opinion . Yeah , well , I 'm not real sure why I got this topic , because I do n't think I checked it off on the list -- Uh-huh . -- because I know very little about the current immigration laws . Uh-huh .
