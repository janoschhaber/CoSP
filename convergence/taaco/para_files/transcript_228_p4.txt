Yeah . You know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for , Yeah , we 've got two great big windows in our back bathroom . Uh-huh , yo- , you 're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything , so . No privacy . No , we do n't have a lot of that , yeah . Well , we 've got at least two windows on every wall in the house . It , Uh-huh . I 'd hate to clean these windows , I really would .
