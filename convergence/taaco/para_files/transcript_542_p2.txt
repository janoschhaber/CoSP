Or are they , is it a penal institution ? Is it , is , is it designed for punishment ? Um , the death penalty surely fits in well with , uh , in a penal situation where you 're trying to punishment . Uh , perhaps not in the manner that we do it but , but it , in , in theory it fits in . In reforma , system , in a reformatory , I mean if you , if you put someone to death you obviously , ca n't reform them . That 's true . So . Uh , th- , the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really do n't , uh , agree with that . I do n't think anyone who would commit a , uh , a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say , well , I was about to kill and dismember this person but , oh , if they catch me they 're going to kill me so I better not do it . I , I just , Yeah . do n't think that , uh , that it works that way . I do n't think it 's done . I do n't think we run it as a deterrent . I mean people say that , but , I mean , if it was really a deterrent , I mean I think like horse thieves in the old west , you know , they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks -- Uh-huh . -- every once in a while . And if we really w- , if it was really seriously going to be a d- , deterrent , I would think that it would be public . I mean I do n't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever , nobody ever sees it . If someone ever , if , you know , like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime , had to sit and watch and , and see a guy burn or , or , you know , something or shot by a firing squad or something like that . I would think you 'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than , you know , telling them that there 's , there 's protestors out here at the , you know . Well , I , I do n't know if that would really work that way or not . Uh , there 's a lot of violence ,
