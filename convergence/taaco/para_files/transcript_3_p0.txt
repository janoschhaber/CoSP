Well , the first thing for me is I wonder , I see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is , um , if privacy is something that disturbs your private state , I mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state , that 's one thing , and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it , in other words , finds something out about you that 's another . And the first kind of invasion of , the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me , and very much everyday in this country , but in the second time , at least overtly , uh , where someone comes in and , uh , finds out information about you that should be private , uh , does not seem , uh , um , obviously , everyday . I , I think I agree with that . I think in a good example on the typical thing that happens , uh , when the phone rang and it 's T I calling , my immediate reaction is that it 's some sort of strange phone message and then I realize , oh , no , this is something I solicited , That 's right .
