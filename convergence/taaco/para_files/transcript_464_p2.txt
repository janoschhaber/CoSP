Yeah . -- you know , it wo n't it 's little job outside and it comes inside . Have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside ? Uh , yeah , we 've tried that , and , uh , you know , there 's certain spots in the house where he likes to -- Yeah . -- go , so , and he chews on plants and all that , but , you know , that 's natural -- That 's nothing , huh . -- for a little puppy . Huh ? Well , it , it , it 'll , it 'll catch on pretty soon , I 'll , I 'll bet you . I , I have a sixteen year old , almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever , and she 's gone the other way , because she 's so old , she does n't have much control -- Oh , really . -- so we 're battling with that problem -- Oh , that 's sad . -- and she still feels good . Uh , she ca n't hear worth a darn or see very well , but she 's got a great appetite , and she knows we 're there , by smell . How old is it ? She 'll be sixteen in May . Man -- And -- -- that 's sad . -- yeah , but we ca n't bear to do anything because -- Oh , of course not . -- she 's been our friend for all these years , so -- I could n't . -- we 're putting up with all her accidents , and the la- , two nights ago , she had diarrhea , and so that was a bad one . But , uh , I think we 're buying a carpet shampooer this weekend . That is really sad . What , what 's the deal , we , we try to , we 're trying to take it on walks now , you know -- Uh-huh . -- and we ca n't because it 's not accustomed to being on a leash -- Yeah . -- and so it , I mean this dog really feels like it 's being killed or something when you try to , you know , tug on it to walk it .
