Great , great . That one was interesting because I talked to a man in , in Washington , D C , and it was hot here , and it was snowing there . So that was pretty interesting . Uh-huh . And I talked to someone about the , uh , the , uh , education system . I forget exactly what the focus was on that one . But that was fairly interesting . And I talked to somebody about credit card usage . Yeah . And I talked to this person who I gathered from speaking to her , that , that she and her family just did n't have much , and they did n't have much credit available to them . Uh-huh . And so she basically did n't use credit cards and did n't know very much about them and how they work , Huh . and , and how you can use them to your advantage , and , and how , you know , you , you can do certain things with them . Yeah , I always , I use everything with my Visa , and I pay it all off . Yeah . So that 's a good deal for me . I get free money for thirty days . Yeah . That 's the way I use them , uh --
