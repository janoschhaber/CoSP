I started at one edge and went over , then you had to cut around the closet -- Uh-huh . -- and cut around a window -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , I 've had my best luck in papering when I start in the middle of a wall , and I 'll start with a plumb line . And start right there . And start in the middle of the wall , and , and go from there , and go all the way around the room . Do you seem to get it straighter , is that the advantage ,
