There 's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons . That 's just , I do n't know . I just think , I think it 's ridiculous . Yeah . I mean , It does n't sit with me very well . I do n't know , I , anymore I keep a thirty-eight in my truck , you know . Really . Yeah , I just about all , well I live in Minneapolis and I , well actually I live in Florida , but I am staying in Minneapolis for a year and -- Uh-huh . -- you know , both areas are pretty crime ridden right now -- Right . -- and it 's just , you never know who is out there . Right . You know it 's just for self protection purposes and then of course there 's the hunting issue , so -- Sure . -- yeah that 's good . What do you do , Jeff ? Uh , I , I 'm in , uh , program control for a company up here . Oh , yeah . Yeah . All right .
