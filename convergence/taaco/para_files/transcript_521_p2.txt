-- is it , is it the A P news wire or is it something that is , uh , a little bit different from that ? Well , uh , it 's similar to that , but it 's DOW JONES , which is , uh , the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire . Uh , okay . So , that 's that 's interesting . Okay . Yeah , I 've had , I had access in the past to , uh , uh , the A P news wire and I thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news . Uh , I 've never used the DOW JONES news wire but , uh , yeah it , uh , do you get any , uh , do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader , like more long term analytical sort of approach ? Uh , well actually not . Uh , I do , uh , follow , uh , uh , uh , I do n't know how to how to describe it so I 'll say a religious newspaper which , which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense .
