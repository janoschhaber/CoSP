-- so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really is n't -- Yeah . -- too great sometimes . Yeah , I usually tend to just , you know , rely on , you know , T V , uh , again , you know , just through the grapevine just , just to know like , you know like what today 's stories are and I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I 'm interested in any particular one . Yeah . The radio does n't really have much news sometimes . The stations I listen to are just mainly music . Yeah , I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all . Yeah . Do you think that T V is , uh , pretty accurate . I mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized or , Well , what I really do n't like about T V , especially local news as compared to like national news is just , uh , it seems , it seems like everything is very spoon feed and you know it 's , it 's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom -- Yeah . -- or like the news , because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports , you know , is your kid 's bus driver smoking crack , on the way to school , you know ? Yeah , it 's they mainly go with like popular topics -- Uh-huh . -- just not like basic news . Yeah . Also , also I have the observation of , uh , with the press is that , like any any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press , you know , which only happened like ten times in my life -- Huh . -- you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had , had more than just a blurb about it . That the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story -- Yeah . -- it 's something wrong . Going , they 're , looks like they 're going more for ratings than for -- Uh-huh . -- you know actual news . I think , you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers -- Uh-huh .
