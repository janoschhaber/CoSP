Hi , good morning . Good morning . Do you have recycling in Sachse ? Yes , we do . We 've -- Do , -- got , uh , a pickup twice a week that they come out and , they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody and they take it . Oh really ? Uh-huh . And it 's twice a week ? Uh-huh . Really ? We have , recently started , uh , a bin program here in Plano where , uh , used to be we , we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up . And now they have , uh , these large green containers and you have to put your trash that you do n't recycle in there . And then they have n't started curbside recycling yet , but they 're , but they 're planning on doing it very soon . Apparently the trucks that they had , um , lined up , they needed the parts for , Saudi Arabia . Oh . And so that put off the program for a while . But , uh , do you recycle ? Um , my kids do . Do they ? Uh-huh . Put it that way . They , they 've been recycling cans -- Uh-huh . -- for extra money .
