and it still did n't work , and we took the car up to , um , a little place called Pep Boys , I do n't know if you have them in your area -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , they 're , they 're pretty reasonable , uh , car repair place also . So , uh , took it up there , towed it up there because it , you know , would n't start or anything and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and , uh , took them about an , an hour to , um , figure out what was , what was blowing the fuse , and it was , it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse . Anyway , ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer and the only problem was that , uh , it had to be a genuine Toyota , uh , alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it , that , that , you know , they sit in there and everything but there 's just some little difference that , um , causes it not to work an i- , Uh-huh , they probably built that in so they could make money . Ye- , yeah , I guess so and that was my , that was my last experience .
