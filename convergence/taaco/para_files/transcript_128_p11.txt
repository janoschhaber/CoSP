I was going to say . I keep not doing it until after I 'm there and then all of a sudden I 'm saying I wish I 'd bought these things . I know , because we can go spend fifteen dollars -- Easily . -- just getting in -- Yeah , yeah , -- the three of us . And then if you want popcorn and stuff -- Yeah . I do n't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both . You know popcorn is not that expensive . No , nowhere near that expensive . So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke . And , it , it 's just the idea that these , uh , these actors , you know , live in such lavish style . I mean , it 's as simple as that . Yeah . We just keep breeding them . Yeah , and as long as we keep paying the money for it , they are going to keep paying them . I guess so . Now have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES ? Yes . Oh yeah . Oh , that was , that was an excellent movie . I have n't seen , we 're waiting for the video . No , do n't . No , really ?
