So , well , this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day , so . Right . Um , well , what do you think is , uh , the pollutants , the main pollutants in the air ? I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that I just , uh , I think they put off so much and they 're not regulated enough . Yeah , well , that 's me too . After , um , on channel thirteen , uh , they had some , some programs the day before , and I 'm not sure that about yesterday , we did n't really watch it too much yesterday , but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and , you know , how we 're affecting the Earth and things by what we do , Uh-huh . as the people and , and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot , Yeah . and that actually , um , as our population increases and , you know , our , of course , our , our cars , you know , our number of cars increase per the population , that 's the problem . But also like you said the industry pollution and , you know , their reg- , their regulation that 's placed on them is , I mean , it 's better than it used to be but it 's incredible that they still do n't have , you know , they do n't , they 're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air . Right . You know , I , I just , I ca n't stand that and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that , you know , they 're supposed to be regulated because we have a , we have a plant , I do n't know about T I but we have a plant , uh , a Pillsbury plant , Uh-huh . in , in a town adjacent to ours , and I know people that work there that , of course , you would n't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals , No . but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the , um , what they do , uh , to , uh , make their dough and st- , to , Really ? clean out the flour and stuff like that , yeah , Huh .
