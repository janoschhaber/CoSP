and I , and I know that it 's good for my health . I know , you know , from everything that you read and you see on television now , exercise is so important to good health . Right . So , you know , you , not only , you know , you 're not only doing something to keep yourself fit , but you 're probably prolonging your life . So . Right . There 's no reason that we should n't do it , but I do n't know . It 's just hard to make yourself go . And I , I think one thing I do n't like about aerobics is that after I 'm finished it 's kind of late at night , and I 've been sweaty , and , and it , you know , I do n't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands . Yeah . So it kind of kills the evening for doing errands . So I think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better . Yeah .
