Okay . When they first said the subject , my mind went kind of blank . I thought , Gee , I have n't taken anything back for a long time . Well , I have n't either , uh , I , I hate returning things . Yeah . I mean , I , I have a friend who , if she likes something , is n't sure what size somebody might need , will buy it in every color and size and , you know , take everything back again . Yeah . It 's , you know , it 's a game to her , but I , I do not like to do that . I consider it kind of a , a waste of my time . And so I 'm usually , uh , pretty careful when I shop -- Uh-huh . -- and I also , you know , usually have , have checked over things , you know , if it 's like an appliance or something to make sure , uh , it has the features in it that I want .
