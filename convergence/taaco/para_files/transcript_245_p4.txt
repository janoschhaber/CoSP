So you 're just as likely to fl- , wake up and discover you 're in two inches of water . Do you have a lot of property , I mean a lot of yard around your house now , in Denton ? Uh , it 's a third of an acre . I do n't think that 's a lot , uh , in fact , I have been real disappointed in the six years that I 've lived out here about lot sizes . I 'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have . Yeah , when you get down closer in to the newer tract homes you find almost like there 's no lot line at all . They 're built practically on top of each other . That 's true . I know , I was , An , and while , while there are some advantages to that , there 's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things . Uh , I just feel hemmed in by that . It 's not as comfortable a living for me . Uh-huh . Well this subdivision here has got , oh , there 's enough to put , oh , I 'd say , uh , what , twelve feet between each house on each side . Well , I 've got more on one side than I 've got on the other , but I 'm like you , I came down from Colorado and there was more land up there around a yard with a big full back yard , which here , I look out my back yard and I can see the gate . I mean the fence is right there , I mean just do n't run too fast , or you 'll hit it and I 'm not used to that either .
