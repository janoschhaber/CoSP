Okay . Um , I guess what , I guess my task . I usually ride my bike . I have , uh , a stationary bike and , uh , a regular bike . And when I can , I like to ride my regular bike outside , because it 's so much nicer . The stationary bike is , is so , uh , Boring . boring . But I have head phones , and I , plus I have it , uh , in the living room so I either watch T V , or we have a fish tank , so I watch the fish , you know . Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied . If , I like to have the T V on , because that usually keeps me , um , more occupied . It kind of takes the time away and I do n't realize , really , that 's really the only time I ever watch T V , is when I 'm on the bike . But , and then usually after I 'm done riding the bike , just to cool myself down , I usually take a walk , you know , and that just kind of gets myself , uh , gets me , you know , to where I 'm not quite as tired I guess . But it 's definitely a task . You think so ? I ca n't say that I really enjoy it . I wish that I did enjoy it more ,
