He told me eight to twelve weeks . Uh-huh . Not anything , you know . I said , but you 're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks . He said , yeah , but that 's just , they tried to put me in some kind of immobilized walker , because he does n't like to put casts on when it 's warm . But I just , the more they tried to get my foot in the more I screamed , I could n't , you know -- I know what you mean . -- adjust that . You know more about this stuff than I do , obviously then , Not fun . No . Well , you 're walking okay now obviously , and you can , Oh , yeah , I have a slight limp from it , but it matches one if I have one on the other side . MUMBLEx . Yeah . Well , anything else about exercise we can talk about . Well , other than I need to go . Yeah , me too , me too . I need to go actually get something to eat here .
