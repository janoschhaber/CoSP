Yeah , but , But I know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially , you know we have , I 'm in Lubbock and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech , and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot . Uh-huh . I have , I have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out . And they -- Yeah . -- they ca n't do anything but work to try to pay them off . And , and , and like one of my friends she has , hers is up to nine hundred dollars and she do , she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she 's going to school . Gee . And , and so I mean that 's just enough to pay rent and buy like thirty-five dollars worth of food a month . So and , and pay for her like , like monthly fee like twen- , yo- , I guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the -- Yes , something like that . -- so all she 's paying is interest on hers every month . Yeah . It just seems crazy to , to me but , Well , my wife got in trouble one time with hers . She was making like , I do n't know what she was making , forty-five dollars a month I think . And fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month . Yeah . So and that was before we got married , so . But it 's , you know , we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and it 's , it 's come out pretty good . Now we have a eighteen year old that 's fixing to get out of high school and go to college . Oh , really ? That 's the first thing he wanted . Was a Visa card ? Yeah . Oh , my goodness . So we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick . I bet . You know , so .
