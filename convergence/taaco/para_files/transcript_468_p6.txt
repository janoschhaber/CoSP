they do really good and I even had , uh , I guess it was last year or the year before , I had some out and it froze and the pansies looked terrible , but they came back later . I did n't do anything to them so they are , uh , they are good to plant in the winter time . They last for a long time then . So , if you start putting them , you know , you can put them out in the spring too , but once it starts getting real hot -- Uh-huh . -- then it just kills them cause they ca n't stand the hot weather . Do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time ? Will they make it through the summer sun ? No , they wo n't make it through the summer because it gets too hot , but they make it through probably winter and spring . So , Well . Yeah , I have got some of those too , cause I love flowers . Well , that is good . Yeah . And I do , I try to do some arts and crafts and I love to go ,
