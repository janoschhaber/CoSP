I mean , not that it would , kind of a pain to , you know , drive over somewhere special just for that , for two little tiny batteries but , Yeah , yeah , but I think the city one could possibly look into that or something . Yeah , that 's true . Uh , if they 've got these bins for all the other little items , I 'm sure if p- , people will have batteries , uh , you know , quite often -- Right , that 's true . -- to , to toss out . Uh , when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the , uh , the truck came by , well , we all ran out to watch it because , you know , we 'd never really seen it -- Uh-huh . -- pick up our stuff and one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he , uh , scanned across the little bar code -- Oh . -- on our bin -- Oh , is that right ? -- as soon as he took the stuff and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just , you know , scanned it , so I do n't know why , what that was reading it for -- Huh . -- but , uh -- Registering our garbage . -- they must be trying to keep track of , you know , who is doing it , or what , I guess . Yeah . I do n't know . Another , Would n't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year . Ooh , for those who are really cooperating . Yeah . Now , that would encourage it .

I 'm sure they could n't afford -- Sure .
