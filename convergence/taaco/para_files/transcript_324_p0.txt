So whenever I think of family reunions , my family , like , got together almost every week . Oh , gee . And there would be like thirty people . So people talk about , you know , big family reunions and I think , like I have a friend who just went to , like , Wyoming to some big ranch , you know , where like there were four hundred people -- Oh , my . -- for their family reunion .
