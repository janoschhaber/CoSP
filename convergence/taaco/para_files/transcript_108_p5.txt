Um , I know our neighbors , when we first went to this bin program said , oh , there 's no way , you know we 're going to have to have pickup twice a week . They were real upset but they were n't , they were only picking up once a week . And we said to them , if you recycle , MUMBLEx you 'll , you know , you 'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container . Yeah . And , uh , it 's , it 's really amazing . The other thing he does , that my husband a real stickler about is we do n't collect our grass clippings . Really . No . He , he got a little mulcher thing . Uh-huh . It 's just a little attachment for the lawn mower and we mow once a week . You know , no , no more often then that . And then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the , on , on , the , uh , the lawn . And it 's amazing , it 's amazing . We do n't collect any of that and that , that has cut down a lot in what we throw out . Yeah , MUMBLEx we do n't e- , we do n't catch it either , mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard . So , if it mows , gets mowed , I do it normally . Uh-huh . And I ca n't mow the yard with the grass catch on it . It 's too heavy . Yeah . So I just m , I just mow it and leave it . Yeah .
