And , uh , and , you know , I can get up , I know . It , it seems to be , be kind of , kind of scary , you know . Because you think of , uh , see my son 's eighteen right now and he , he 's , uh , he wants to go into engineering . And the , the , the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open and he 's interested in , basically , three different areas . But , uh , it 's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that . He needs to do his own course of investigation and , and see what he can do because who knows what 's going to happen in another thirty years . Uh-huh . Yeah . And in thirty years it becomes pretty critical . I mean , my , uh , brother-in-law is like , uh , I mean he 's sixty . He 's not ready to retire but his company is , is , uh , is , uh , closing up . Uh-huh . And because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff . And all the nuclear and stuff which is what he , what he was working on . He 's getting cut back and he 's not ready to retire . Yeah , he may be retired .
