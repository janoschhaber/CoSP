-- yeah , because , um , she was pay , of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now . It was like four dollars a semester hour -- Uh-huh . -- and so I was going to school for , you know , just a few hundred dollars a semester , and she was paying forty dollars an hour -- Golly , -- so she paid ten times as much because she was out of state . Yeah , luckily I 've paid in state tuition the whole time . Oh , that 's good . Yeah , so I think that would be one thing I would definitely consider -- Uh-huh , um , -- try to find a school within the state that , um , I liked well enough to attend . Uh-huh . The second thing is some colleges only offer the , uh , liberal arts -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , whereas like State , they offer engineering courses -- Right , yeah . -- so depending on what your major is , or medical , you might want to atteck , some , um , attend somewhere like Tech -- Yeah , right . -- and , um , aside from the , uh , well some schools may even give you financial aid , where another one wo n't . Yeah , that 's true , that was something else I had , was , I had government aid , of course , but , uh , it was wonderful , because I got one of those grants that you do n't have to repay -- Oh , really . -- and , yeah , it was so nice -- Um . -- it paid most of my tuition , and , um , a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing so . Wow , that 's great . Yeah , I really , Was it a Pell grant ? I 'm sorry , what did you say ? What kind of grant was it ?
