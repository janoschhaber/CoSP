I understand , we , uh , we 've gone through the same things with ours , we 've had , you know , they 've been ill , I mean I take off work , Oh yeah . to take care of my cats , you know , my boss thinks I 'm absolutely crazy . And then we had a baby and it 's like , all right who comes first the cat or the baby . The cat was here first so . I know , it 's hard . And , and then when we go to sleep at night , you know , it 's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us .
