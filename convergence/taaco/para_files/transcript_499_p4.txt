Yeah . -- and he 's so funny , he just follows my son around just like a dog . Huh . He wo n't even let my son shower . Yeah . He meows and wants to get in the bathroom and , while he showers , it 's so hilarious . So he 's quite a animal . Yeah , boy , I guess . Well as long as he does n't get too aggressive . I guess with the daughter he 's all right . Yeah . You would n't want him to carry her off or something . Yeah , well , we , we did , uh , actually take him to the pound a couple of times , you know -- Uh-huh . -- because we just could n't have him being -- Sure . -- so aggressive towards the girl , but , uh , he seems to have mellowed out a little bit , and we do keep our daughter away from him . So . Yeah , yeah . Were it not for my son , the cat would not be in this house .
