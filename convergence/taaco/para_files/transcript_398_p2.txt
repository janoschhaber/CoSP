Which is , you know , it , it 's interesting , but it , it 's what I thought was nice is you could al- , there was always time to talk to professor , you know , and , and they knew you . Uh-huh . You were n't just in their class , you know , and so you could , you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time , and , or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever , you know , you could sit down , talk to them about a problem . They 're always willing to help you out . So , but I , I 's , I , I put that against , uh , my high school where we had , uh , a biology class of three hundred and fifty students and . Wow , in high school ? Yeah -- Oh . -- it was a biology lecture class -- Wow . -- and , you know , it , it just was n't the same . You 're sitting there , and you 're taking notes and , you know , you got a computerized test scores , multiple choice , because there 's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test -- Uh-huh . -- uh , you know , a three hundred fifty person short answer test . And , it just was n't the same . You , you 'd run , you 'd pass the teacher in high school and , even in high school you could say high to your teachers , unless you 're in that biology class , and they just , they 'd look at you like , do I know you ? or should I know you ? Uh-huh . Yeah , there 's , it 's , the classes here are pretty big ,
