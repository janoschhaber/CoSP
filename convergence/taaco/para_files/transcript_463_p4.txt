And , um , but ours is about , it 's , you know , it 's a nice home , it 's definitely not one of the , the smaller ones , and , um , it 's not the biggest either . But . Yeah , new ones , I mean , they , they tend to , to be real tiny , but that uh , especially in newer neighborhoods , my , my brother just built a new house . He lives in Wichita , Kansas , and the , um , the neighborhood actually fought him on it , because he , he was , um , the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood . Oh . Now , that 's because he was , he 's doing a lot of it himself -- Yeah . -- and , you know , for example , landscaping and , and lots of the other stuff , and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots MUMBLEx in the neighborhood , but -- Yeah . You . -- but they were , they were pretty touchy on it . He was a little surprised . You know , that 's interesting you say that , because we do have , we have those architectural codes here -- Uh-huh .
