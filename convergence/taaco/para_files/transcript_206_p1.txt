Uh , I ca n't remember . Refresh my memory . It was , uh , that was the one that was used so much in the campaign . In the politica , in the presidential race . Uh , may , it may not have been Maryland . It may have been Massachusetts , I do n't remember . Um , I do n't remember myself . Anyway , well the question is , you know , do you think , i- , it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it 's done right ? Um , I think if they , if they started executing them on a regular basis , uh , that I think it might make a difference . Right now , If it , I do n't see it making a difference . I do n't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they 're afraid they 're going to get sentenced to death . I mean , Uh-huh .
