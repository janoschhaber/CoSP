What did you have before you bought that . I had a Buick Regal . Did you ? Yeah . I had , uh , a Mazda R X Seven before that and that was the worse car I 've ever driven in my life . The Buick was , was great . It was nine years old and it , Really ? was still going strong . The only problems I had with it in the nine years that I owned it , I had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old . Really ? And that was the only major problem that I had , I mean , I had like little piddly things like -- Yeah . -- I had to replace the muffler and I had replaced the tires and , uh , seems like it had a radiator leak once . But I never had any major anything , Right . other than the compressor . I really never had anything major with my Mazda but it was a standard also and the clutch went out on it toward the end , I had it five years and the last year , last two years it seemed to go out really easily . I think it went out twice in two years and that 's , that 's a lot it should n't go out that much . Huh-uh . And so I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the Honda but I do n't think I 'm going to do that again . I think I 'm going back to automatic now . Well , I never , well , I kind of know how to drive standard but I 've never owned one so I had n't , I do n't drive one a lot . Right . So , I do n't feel comfortable in traffic with it . Right . And for everything I 've heard it 's a lot easier to sell an automatic . Yeah , it is . And , That 's true . and resale value is really important to me . Yeah , it is me too that 's why I got the Honda . Yeah . Hondas have great resale value .
