We get fifteen days a year sick time , and , uh , we get twenty-four days a year , right from the day one when you start work , you get twenty-four days a year , uh , time off . Right . Well , that 's good . Yeah . Yeah , that 's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell , is , uh , I used to work with the Army Research Institute , and being a , uh , a government organization you got quite a few holidays off . Right . But here you do n't get that . You maybe get two or three a year . Uh-huh . So it 's really , unless you , unless you have some vacation time or some , some sick leave or whatever , um , you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time . Uh-huh . So , that 's , that 's kind of a drawback I think . But , uh . I do n't know .
