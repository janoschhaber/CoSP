So , uh , basically it , it sorts out into that , and then once , about once every three or four years I try to get over to England , because I lived there for a while , Wow . some years back . I 've only been there once . Oh . and I 'd love to go back . Beautiful country . Beautiful country , And it was , beautiful people . Yeah , it , But , uh , and I 'd real , we had a great time . really like to go because , um , I 'm fairly recently married and , and my husband has been hearing about these people for years and , uh , but he 's never met them , so , uh , I 'd like , I 'd like to do that . But anyway , that 's , that 's our typical vacation , and , uh , we enjoy the family vacations , but the other ones are very special getaways , and we probably take one of each every year . How about yourself ?
