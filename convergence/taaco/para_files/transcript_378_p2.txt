When I was growing up I was , was into coin collecting , and that dropped off about the time I hit puberty , I guess , and then , my hobbies in high school went just to the sports . Now my latest one is classic cars . I 've -- Um . -- I had a sixty-six Mustang I was rebuilding . Almost had it done , and I went on , went ahead and sold it . Oh , my gosh . But it was fun . I really enjoyed it . Well , how 'd you learn to do that -- Oh , you just , -- to fix them up ? You just get a book that tells you how to do it or what ? No , you just kind of , all I did is , uh , I bought the car and then , uh , you know , you can , I , uh , was just in a supermarket and I seen a , a magazine for , you know , basically it , it was called MUSTANG MAGAZINE and -- Uh-huh . -- and so I bought it and they had , uh , some names , some companies that sold mustang parts , and I just started ordering some parts and , and , you know , basically , you know , I , what I did was , I redid the whole interior .
