And I think that it 's just people have got to be aware . Unfortunately , there are a lot of people that just do n't care and they do n't want to think about it . Yeah , that 's true .

Do they not ever burn trash or anything like , Very little . That 's another thing that , see there were no , Then , that 's pollution . I know Amway . I use a couple of things from Amway that it says this is burnable material . Well , that does n't do me any good because I do n't have any place to burn it . Yeah , I know . I guess you run into the pollution factor . Yeah . And then just like the glass bottles , that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents , but not in Texas . Yeah . And there is no place I can take glass to . Uh , So , I still throw away a lot of glass . It is really sad . Yeah . And then the packaging thing really grips me . You buy some and it 's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic ,
