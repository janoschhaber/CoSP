I was looking for a four door car having driven the R X Seven so long , Uh-huh . and it was so small and it 's really impractical . So , I wanted something with a real trunk , and four doors something easy to get in and out of and I looked at the Galant and those were really nice and I can get them for a great price . Yeah . But I found it hard to deal with the , the dealership I was going through . Oh . So , that 's how I ended up with a Honda . I was n't even looking for a car when I bought this car . I , uh , I was thinking about buying a Prelude from a friend who was moving to New York or something
