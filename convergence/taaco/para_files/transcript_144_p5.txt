Is that how they did it ? Yeah . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , I 'm real curious because my family , it did n't sound , I do n't think my family is as big as your husband 's . I do n't think we 'd need a whole church , but , um , the problem is we are all really scattered , around . There is n't any one place where most of us live , so if we ever had a reunion , we 'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel . I mean , you know , there would be one person who lived there that would have a house , but they could n't put everybody up . So it , I think it would get kind of expensive . But , you know what you can do ? Huh ? A lot of these lakes and things , if you could find a centrally located , like , say about the same distance for all of you all to come ? Uh-huh . They have these places where you can rent them and it , you know , like on a lake , Uh-huh . like , uh , it 's a big place , I mean , you know , Uh-huh . it 's got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff ,
