if they did hit a ball I would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in , you know . I know I 'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game . I rarely go but we went last year because my brother , my brother is impossible , Uh-huh . when , um , he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff , Uh-huh . and if there 's a game on , he 's watching it . I mean , that 's all there is to it , Really ? and he 's like glued at the T V . I 'm glad my husband 's not like that . Oh , I 'm glad my husband 's not like that either , I 'd kill him . My brother 's like that and , um , see he goes to a lot of games , not a real lot , but he tries to go , then my father got us some tickets , Uh-huh . so my brother 's wife and my husband and I went . Last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because , Uh-huh . you know , being a non-American you want to see what a baseball game is like .
