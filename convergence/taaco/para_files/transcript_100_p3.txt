well jeans are n't exactly professional but , for some reason a mini skirt is , to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans just because it 's , maybe it 's just because of the sexist views and everything but you just feel like you 're , you 're being , showing too much le- , I do n't know , I would n't want to wear a mini skirt to work . We- , I have seen a few people do it though , but they , they were n't overly shor , and they were n't overly revealing . They were pretty much in good taste , but , um , Uh-huh . for me I just , I just , cou , would n't want to do that . Well there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts . Yeah . There are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee . Uh-huh , that 's what I 've seen . and again it depends upon the size , the shape of the person , Uh-huh . as well as the shape of the person 's legs . Uh-huh . Now , I also , uh , even though I retired from education , I , uh , I do modeling and I teach at a modeling agency here . Uh-huh . And , uh , so , when we are doing wardrobing and we have , uh , two , two hour classes in wardrobe , we do discuss a great deal , the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job . Uh-huh . Uh , even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through , uh , grandmothers , Uh-huh . in my class . And , uh , whe , I always try to emphasize the , clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad , Uh-huh . because maybe they , those are not the clothes that are the most , uh , appealing to you , or the most , uh , complimentary to you . Right . But , uh , the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you do n't really want .
