I think it was added afterwards . I think the real , the principal was , uh , education for civic participation . Right . The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter and you could n't pull the wool over their eyes . Right . It has taken on a more profound , and you 'd think we 'd notice it , economic uh , thrust . Yeah . Well , that 's exactly what I was going to say . Now there seem to be really three reasons for education . One is education for civic duty . One is education for economic reasons . And one is education for civilization . I mean and I think that one , Well I 'm glad that you added that one . Yeah , I think that one 's significant . That 's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor and then I quit and got disabused of that notion . But , uh , the , uh , uh , now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is , uh , an economic enterprise to train people for jobs . And , uh , I 'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is . And I 'm really sad to say this , I never thought I would have but I really think that , uh , the educational establishment has become part of the problem . And , uh , that 's why I guess I 'm sort of , reluctantly , uh , in favor of these , uh , choice programs . Right . Well I , I g- , agree with everything that you 've said so far and the only that I 'd want to add is that I 'm a little more in contact , I think , with public school teachers than perhaps you are , uh , except as a parent of your child and the sense that I get from public school teachers that I know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing and they are the three things that you mentioned . But they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related -- Right .
