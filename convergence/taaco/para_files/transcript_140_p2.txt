MUMBLEx any MUMBLEx space . I get too involved in reading sometimes that I neglect what I should be doing . That 's true , I do the same thing . You get so involved in what you 're reading . What types of crafts do you do ? I do a little bit of woodworking , well , I used to . I do n't have the equipment here . We moved to Dallas about a year ago -- Uh-huh . -- and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment -- Uh-huh . -- and I did some of that . Um , here I 've mostly done things that I can do strictly by hand , um , sewing and quilting and , um , what else have I done ? Things to hang on the wall . Uh-huh . Mostly just stuff that I can , you know , use right around the house -- Uh-huh . -- or give away as gifts . Right . I 've been making a lot of quilts , well , not a lot , but several quilts lately . Uh-huh . So . I enjoy , uh , sewing and needlework also . I 've , I 've , uh , made some small things , cross stitch things . And , um -- Uh-huh . -- back when I was in high school , I worked at a needlework shop , and I , I used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that , and I , I still remember how to do it . It 's just been so long since I 've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that . But I have recently done some cross stitch . Uh-huh . And I enjoy doing that . It 's just the same old thing , it 's just getting the time to do it . Yeah . I 've done some cross , um , cross stitch , but I never count right , and I always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered -- Uh-huh . -- or , or something . It never has worked out completely . Yeah , it takes a lot of concentration . I mean , it was the type of thing , I was , I was making some little things for Christmas , and I also made a little thing for a baby gift , and , uh , I thought , Oh , I can do this while I watch T V . Wrong . Right . No , you must pay all attention to what you 're doing .
