Uh-huh . Hey Steve . Uh , They just , uh , they just started a recycling program here , I think . Actually , this is my first experience with recycling program but , uh , instead of just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about , uh , I am starting to split stu- , split stuff up . The only disadvantage is that they do n't pick it up at the curb . They make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there . What are they doing up there ? Well , here in Saskatoon , uh , much the same thing . There is no curb pick up of , uh , any of the recycled products . Uh , we 're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people . Uh , there are areas where we could , uh , actually we have a couple of the , uh , handicapped societies , types of places where the uh , one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers so , uh , we are able to , uh , have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there are , there 's a uh , deposit program on plastic and glass containers . Well , primarily soft drink bottles and so we are able uh to take it to one of the uh , rehabilitation centers
