yeah . And I , I was so relieved because I 've been making a real concerted effort , make , you know , recycling the aluminum and -- Uh-huh . -- the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it . Right , yeah , we used -- And , uh -- -- to take ours there . -- my garage was just getting overwhelmed . I know . And , of course , I did n't go weekly , so it became quite a big -- Right . -- thing , and , uh , Right , I 'm really glad they do it . Uh , yeah , I do news , mostly newspapers and , uh , plastic two liter diet Coke bottles . Yes , yeah . And aluminum cans some , but I do n't use as many of those . Uh-huh . I guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really , that are really dirty that you have to wash out . Yeah , well , I found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they 're not a recycling number one or two . Uh , ha . Uh , ha , Wasting all your time and effort and , Putting it in there . Thinking I was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned . Yeah , yeah . But , uh , you know , but it , it 's not that hard now that I 've got this -- Got your routine down . -- system under control . Yeah . Yeah . Well , I guess there are some places , uh , in the north , in particular that , uh , have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle because they charge you , let 's see , they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight . Uh , uh-huh . So if you recycle things , of course , then you do n't have all that weight in there . Yeah , I do find that I do n't have as much to throw away -- Right . -- because -- That 's right . -- all the bulky things are , are -- Yeah . -- being tossed in -- Yeah .
