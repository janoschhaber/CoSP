Well , we 've been here since January , so -- Well , -- we , we still feel very new , but , uh -- Yeah . -- it 's working up to a year now , so , I guess we 're old timers compared to some people . Yeah , I think that 's a good excuse . You need to get into the -- Right . -- the system a little more and know where to take things . Yeah . We 've been here probably two and a half years , and , and we did n't recycle at all before we came -- Uh-huh . -- so I think we 're doing well .

Well , the , um , glass and the newspaper we usually take to Walmart . They have , um , in behind Walmart they have bins -- Uh-huh . -- and then we usually save up our cans and , and change them in for money .
