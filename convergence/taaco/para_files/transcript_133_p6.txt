Really ? Yeah , that was , it 's a really nice area , I 've been there before and it 's , I , I could n't imagine ge- , living just sixty miles north of them but they were plagued , they were plagued with them , with mosquitoes . And you can go out , outside in the daytime , all right , but the minute the sun went down , um , that 's when it 's usually , the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out . Huh . I mean , just the very second , it 's really strange . They , uh , they must , uh , work on that , you know , the , i- , it gets cooler when the sun sets and then they all come out . Well , have you ever , have you ever taken any of those , um , what do they call this , MUMBLEx lights , have you ever used those ? Oh , yeah , yeah , I never really noticed how effective they were , but , um , because that was n't really , I bought them , MUMBLEx I really did n't get to use them like , oh , there 's mosquitoes let 's turn them . We just sort of lit them . Uh-huh . And , um , we were n't bothered that much by mosquitoes , so , we did n't really contribute it to that . But , um , I think in an area that 's really thick with mosquitoes , I ca n't see all this little , uh , smoke buckets I call them , Yeah . MUMBLEx they work , but they 're suppose to work really well . Huh . Oh , I 'm in my paperwork here , that 's what I do when I wait for a phone call , I get in my paperwork . Oh , to find my most important parts . But I do n't know , I do n't know if I 'm going to go , I wish was an avid camper and I could really talk about like gardening or something , you can talk about that a lot , Uh-huh . but , um , I do want to go again . We just moved to a new hou- , into a house , so , I do n't think camping , maybe in the backyard , but I do n't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer . Yeah , I 'd , I 'd like to go camping cross-country , um , I just got married less than two years ago , so , we do n't have any , any children yet , um , So , it 's easy for you to go . Yeah , so , easy to pick up and go , and , s- , we have a van and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it . Um , oh , God . So , it 's not really , I guess , camping the way peop- , most people picture camping in the tent but , I do n't know but that sounds that my , my kind of camping , it really does . Yeah , okay , um , well , um , that is MUMBLEx is to have a , a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it , plus your tent . Yeah , or , or get ,
