but it 's such a dust collector to be out , and so forth . Yeah . And most of my things are dust collectors . Uh , and I hate to dust . I know . So first thing I think of is how easy would this , thing be to clean . That 's funny . No , I do some , I have really gotten out of it . I do n't do it quite as much as I used to . Um , I guess because I , I went back to school , so I do n't have as much time . Oh , you do n't have time . No , and I have two children also . You definitely do n't have time . It keeps me very busy . But I really enjoy it when I do do it , when I get the chance , you know . It 's really , it 's so relaxing to just sit , and , but once I get started , I ca n't put it down .
