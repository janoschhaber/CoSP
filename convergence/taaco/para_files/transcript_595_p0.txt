We do n't even have to cook dinner anymore . Yes . Yeah , really . Uh , but I , uh , I 've heard , I do n't know this for a fact , but I 've heard that a lot of families really do n't spend a great deal of time together . That ki- , the kids maybe on the average get , uh , something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents . That 's what I 've heard too . Uh , It seems bizarre to me . I do n't quite understand it , although I think probably the , the worst thing that 's happening in the world , at least the modern world today , is television . Yeah . Not so much because , uh , it 's bad per se , although there is some pretty crappy programming and I thin , there 's also some , uh , I think , uh , poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time . Right . It 's so darned easy to turn the thing on . I know it . I 've , I tell myself sometimes , just sit down after work , So I refuse to have one in the house . Oh really ?
