we had the house built and so this is our , our fifth year in it I guess , and , uh , um , it was a real excitement to , uh , to go out and select the house and have one made and built and like you wanted it , we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses . And , um , as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home , and they 're good for about five years or four years and after that they start falling apart . So , I would , uh , not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in , uh , because they 're overpriced , uh , but they 're a cheap house . If you ca n't afford something good , you know , they 're good for that , and , um , you can call it a home because it 's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head , but as far as the costs for what you 're getting , uh , the longevity of the house is not , uh , is not worth it . How about in your case ? Well , in my case my husband is not a carpenter , but , in fact , he 's in electronics , but he knew the only way we 'd ever have a new home is if he would build it . So it took him about two and a half years , but , uh , he built us a house , it 's , uh , we have thirty-two hundred square feet , and it 's a brick house ,
