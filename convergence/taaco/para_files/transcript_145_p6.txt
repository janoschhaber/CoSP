but that , that 's the way it is . Ye- , if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death , then do it , you know , uh . We had one in Virginia that was sentenced to death and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago , I do n't know if there was anything in your paper about it . I did n't notice it , huh-uh . And there was a lot of protest , even Robert Redford , you know , was protesting this guy 's execution . Gosh , yeah . So the governor backed down and I was so mad . Oh , man .
