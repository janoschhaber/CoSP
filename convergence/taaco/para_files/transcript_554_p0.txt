I do n't think anybody pays too little . No , I would tend to agree very highly . I think that we 're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it . Do you get hit up for local taxes there ? Yeah , we sure do . Here in Indiana we pay , uh , we pay county income tax , state income tax , we pay five percent sales tax , uh , you name it , they tax it . Oh , so y- , y- , you get the whole smorgasbord . That 's right we , Well , I , I actually live in New Hampshire -- Uh-huh . -- tax free or die . Right . Uh-huh . Which is probably pretty nice , but I 'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high . No , actually there 's no sales tax in New Hampshire either . There 's no sales tax either ? No , what there is , is very high property taxes because that 's how they fund schools and everything . Uh-huh . The only problem is I work in Massachusetts , so they -- Right . -- they hit me up for the five percent there . Taxachusetts Yep , but , it , well , you know , we , it 's only a state tax here , no local . Uh-huh . We 've got a five percent sales tax . Right . But , uh , the problem is that so I 'm paying state tax even if I do n't live here . Right . But , at least on things like stock options and things like that , they do n't tax me .
