Do you ever think that there 's a crime that 's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just does n't deserve to live anymore ? That 's a good question . Uh , there would be a point , there was a point where I would have said , no , that no one would deserve to die for , for a crime that he committed . But , uh , since I 've become a parent and since I 've seen , uh , things like Jeffrey Dahlmer , I really have to question that . I really , uh , I , I ca n't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people . Uh-huh . And , uh , try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment . Uh , Of the statements made by people against the , the death penalty , um , I , I like the statement made by Cuomo . Cuomo I believe is , um , he 's , he 's governor of New York but , uh , he 's , uh , against the death penalty . But , um , he said that he would , he would want to , to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if , if they did something to his wife . And that 's , but , but , even , even in that circumstan- , in that , uh , uh , situation he would b- , he would hope that there would be people around him who would , uh , keep him from doing the , doing the things . Oh , it 's a , uh , it 's a question of your , your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response . Right , exactly .
