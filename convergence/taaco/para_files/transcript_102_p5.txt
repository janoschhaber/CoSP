I was think , that is one solution to it . I do n't know how I feel about that . But I do n't , that 's not really democratic . Not what I 'd consider truly democratic . Well Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United States . As , uh-huh . And it 's not for me to say that they 're not . Uh-huh . Um , they , they feel , I mean here you have the right to vote and they simply define it as a duty there . You know , we have , just as we have a r- , a duty to pay taxes , you know , is that democratic ? I mean , we do n't have the right to pay taxes in this country , we have the duty to pay taxes . It 's a duty , right . And in that country it 's a duty to pay taxes and it 's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent . And it 's not clear to me that , that 's so much less democratic . Um . Uh-huh . I do n't know , but part of me rebels against that , I , it 's , that 's , but then I 'm an American . it 's complex question when you start thinking about it , is n't it . Yeah . And some people do n't vote , I mean there is like three or four percent of Australians do n't vote and I think they 're el , eligible for a fine . I do n't know if they actually are fined or , or what happens , but you 're eligible for some sort of fine if you do n't vote . Uh-huh . That 's interesting . I have people here that I know that have never registered to vote . Uh-huh . And I think , I think they feel they can criticize if they do n't . Yeah , I was sort of , s- , I told them if they do n't vote they do n't have the right to criticize .
