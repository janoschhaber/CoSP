uh-huh . So , uh , right now , we 're on , we get f- , you know , aid from the state at this point because there 's no other way to do it . And my ex-husband just sort of took off and does n't pay child support . Oh dear . So right now I know what I 'm getting from the state and , uh , I have to balance , more or less , what I get from the state with my bills and , uh , you know , try to work as many days as possible . Uh-huh . Any time they call me in . But I still have to figure out . If I work too many days , then I lose all my state aid and if I do n't work enough days then I do n't get enough to meet the bills and it 's like a juggling act every single month . Uh-huh . Like this week I 've been just holding my breath and hoping they 'll call me in but they probably wo n't because next week the kids have school vacation . I see . So , you know , the four days before , they only have a four day week -- Uh-huh . -- and they usually do n't need subs because everybody 's pretty good about coming in . A- , oh , I see . They do n't like to be absent before a vacation . Oh , sure . But we 're shopping around as far as , well I 'm shopping around as far as trying to get , uh , that 's why I 'm doing this , to get some extra money . Uh-huh . And , uh , getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts . My kids are in Boy Scouts so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me . So it 's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit . But , you know , we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul . I guess we 're in the situation that a lot of am- , middle-class Americans are in . Uh-huh . Yeah ,
