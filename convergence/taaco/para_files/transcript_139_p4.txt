I like that kind of stuff . I think the last novel I read I read , I guess , in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year . It was a , um , last name 's MUMBLEx , it 's called PIERCING , no , it 's called THIS PRESENT DARKNESS . Um . It 's , uh , kind of unusual book . It 's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that . Oh that sounds interesting . It sounds really good .
