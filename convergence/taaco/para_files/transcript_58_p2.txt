Well , I tell you what , I 'm a kind of , uh , a history nut . I 'm trying to think back now , I read an awful lot of , uh , periodicals and , uh , you know , almost what you call reference books . Uh-huh . And , uh , the last , uh , I 'm embarrassed to say the last , you know , honest to gosh , cover to cover book that I read , I can not , right offhand , I tried to read , uh , one of the , the Michener , uh , LONE STAR or the , the TEXAS HISTORY BOOK . I have never been able to make it through any of Michener 's work . Oh , well , I 've had similar problems . It does tend to , to , Have you , are you a Civil War buff at all ? Yeah , as a matter of fact , yeah . Because I finished one , I think this is like two years ago , and somebody had given me one of these dinky do , crappy women 's novels set in the Civil War , John Jakes with , Yeah . and the novel did n't do that much for me . But , boy , the period of time was fascinating . Uh-huh . So , I then read , was it BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM , Uh-huh . or , yeah , I think it was BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM . BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM . It 's kind of like a historical compendium , Yeah . of the Civil War , and it 's not a story of the Civil War ,
