I do n't think they can , they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I , I -- Yeah . -- did n't , I mean , they do n't know that I do n't use drugs . They just tested me once . Right , right . But , I used to work for a power company , so it was very important that they make sure their employees , especially linemen -- Uh-huh . -- uh , were clean . Uh-huh . And since I was just , you know , one of the office folk , I guess it was n't as important to them that they test me regularly . But I know they test most of the service people fairly regularly -- Uh-huh . -- reg- , uh , just across the board . Yeah . And are they tested random ? No , they 're , all of them are tested -- They 're ... -- once every three mo- , it 's a rotation . Oh , okay . I see . But it , but again , it depends on what job you 're in . Yeah . The men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot and the men that drive the trucks -- Uh-huh . -- with , with the guys that fix the power lines are n't tested as much . Uh-huh . But , but see , they make that clear to them as they hire those guys -- Oh , I see . -- what , what the drug testing schedule is . They say we , we 're testing you tomorrow and we 'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here . Uh-huh . Okay , so they know that . And that 's ... Yeah , it 's , it 's made very clear upon hiring . Uh-huh . Okay . Well ... Well , have we spent our at least five minutes ?
