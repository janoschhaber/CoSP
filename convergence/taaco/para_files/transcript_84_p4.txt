Yes . and , uh , the reason I 'm at home is when I had my kids , and I was scheduled to go back and I tell you how much in the dark ages it was . Um , I had been rated number one in the field and then I took , uh , when I became pregnant I also got meningitis , Oh . and then delivered the first baby three months early , My gosh . and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home , and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment . Could you hold the phone for one second , Sure . Thanks . Okay , I 'm back . And then they used to , uh , and then I had a second one eighteen months later , they told me to put them back to back and , of course , to maintain and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one , Wow . because that 's when I go into labor MUMBLEx four and a half months and I do n't even know it . Of course it 's real easy to take care of the first one when you 're on your back . Oh , yeah , very easy , very easy and they , they put me on twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then to , to try to control the labor and see how far it was going , and after the baby was born , since it was n't premature , then they said they would n't cover the cost of the monitor .
