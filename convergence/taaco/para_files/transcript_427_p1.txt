I come from a family of golfers . Uh-huh . I mean , I was raised by a man , my stepfather who , with a two handicap , I mean , he , he , he , he could get down on his knees and hit the ball , I mean , further than most people could hit it . Sure . And my mother who is now , he 's , my stepfather is dead , but my mother who is now seventy-one , I can remember her being , I believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap , but , but , uh , all they did every day in their life was to play golf every , they 'd leave work and go to a golf course , or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond , Virginia and just , uh , play nine holes of golf . Yeah .
