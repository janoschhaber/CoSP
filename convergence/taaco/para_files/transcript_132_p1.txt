I have enjoyed aerobics in the past , and I enjoy that because I like the group association , you know , like exercising with other people . Yeah . And , um , and that 's my favorite way to exercise . Well , that 's neat . Yeah , I do walk some too . My wife 's about five months along -- Oh . -- so she 's been walking quite a bit , so that is a good exercise for that . Yeah , it 's nice to do it together , too , I guess . Uh-huh . My husband and I use to walk together , but our schedules do n't coincide as well as they used to , and so , we very seldom get together to walk but , when you , when you work out , do you pretty much do it on your own schedule , or do you go to groups or , I , I do it on my own schedule . Uh-huh . We used to try and belong to clubs or the Y , stuff like that , but it was so difficult to go on a regular basis , to drive the distance you have to go . Uh-huh . Save the fees , we 've , uh , just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment . So , And then you can do it whenever you want I guess .
