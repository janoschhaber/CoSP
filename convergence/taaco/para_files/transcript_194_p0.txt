Okay , this is really ironic that this would , I would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away . Oh , no . And it 's just been tearing me up all day . Oh , I bet . Because we have just been looking all over for him . We 've been to the pound , we 've been to the humane society , we 've been to the adoption center , we 've just been all over the neighborhood , we 've been calling neighbors . So this is just really strange . Oh , I guess so . Have you lost him before ? No , this is the first time . Um , he 's gotten out before , but he 's always stayed right here -- Uh-huh . -- you know , he 's never gone away . And so this is just really strange , you know because , What kind of a dog is he ? Um , he 's part golden Lab and part , uh , , let 's see , Alaskan , no , not Alaskan . I always forget . Yeah . Uh , Australian shepherd . Oh , boy , he 's a big one . he 's pretty big . That 's why it really surprises me , you know , that he has n't come back , because , like I said , he 's never gone away like this before , and , I would think , you know , he might , I mean , he might could get hurt by a car or something . I do n't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big .
