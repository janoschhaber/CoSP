and I , and luckily , everything was under warranty , so it 's only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed . It would have been like two thousand . Well , we 've always , uh , we 've always had Oldsmobiles , and , uh , been very , uh , happy with Oldsmobiles , but , uh , my wife thought she wanted to get a Ford Mustang and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be one of those , uh , Mitsubishi Eclipses . She real- , Those , those are nice cars . She likes , uh , likes those . She has a sister that lives in , uh , Phoenix that has one and , uh , really , uh , enjoys it . Well , what , uh , what things do you consider when you buy a car ? Um , the gas mileage for one thing , and I 've , I 've , I 've always had like stick shift . I want to , the next car I get I want it to be automatic . I see . I , uh , I , I hate driving anyway , and then , and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now . Yeah , especially when you 're in high traffic areas -- Yeah . -- and have to mess with that all the time . And , you know , when you work nine to five , or eight to five , and you 're in rush hour traffic to and from work , unfortunately . That makes it very frustrating . And I look , and one of the things with Chrysler right now is , is their , the warranties that they have , and I , I feel like their , everybody I 've talked to that owns one , has , has , has been real pleased with it , and I like the , the driver 's air bag , I like that . Now this is a LeBaron ? Uh , yeah , well all Chrysler products has it in there , but LeBaron would be the next car I get , yeah . I sure like the , uh , convertible , those rag top LeBarons , they really look sporty .
