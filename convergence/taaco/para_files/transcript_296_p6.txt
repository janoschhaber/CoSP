and , of course , it was , you know , a little more expensive to live on the lake , but I just thought that was grand . And I think a lot of people did n't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them , but there was quite a few lakes all around there . It seemed like , it was almost like you were living on an island there was so much water around where I was . I said I was n't close to downtown Pontiac , I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from , from the city limits and it was really nice out there . Yeah . We had , uh , Pine Knob -- Oh . -- you know , to go skiing -- Right . -- and stuff . Right . So there were things around there . Really was pretty nice . Sure , sure , and d- , is n't that where they have a summer music festival there , too ? Right , right in the summertime they have musicals there and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope . That 's right , that 's right . I know , we used to , we , we did n't do a lot of it , but we did . Yeah , yeah . We did , so those are always fun . And Alpine , was it Alpine was another ski slope -- Uh-huh . -- that we went to , Uh-huh , uh-huh . It was nice . I always tell people that in the winter we use , we used to , uh , my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on , you know , make a pond in the backyard for us . Oh , yeah , yeah . So but , uh , you know , we probably did some ice skating on it ,
