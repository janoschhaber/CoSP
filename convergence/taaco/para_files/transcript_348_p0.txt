Well , the types of vacations that I usually take , I usually come back more tired after my vacation , then I do , you know , before I take it . Um , I need to definitely take a vacation where all , all I do is rest . And I guess to do that I 'd probably have to take it at home . Oh . But , um , the vacation spots that I like to go to are places like the Bahamas and Florida . I enjoy the beach . Oh , I am , after our last summer 's vacation I am antibeach . Antibeach . Uh-huh . We went to , uh , Cape Hatteras . Uh-huh . Well , we , we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland , and we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days . Uh-huh . And , uh , uh , the , the waves were huge . I 've never quite seen waves like this one -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , I was standing in water not more than , in barely above my ankles -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you 're in sand above your ankles . Right . And I was standing there talking to my daughter and this really big wave came and totally threw me , and one foot did not come out of the sand , and it tore the ligaments in my knee . Uh-huh . So I 'm never going to another beach again , ever . I 'm ma- , You might be like I am . I enjoy , I enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas , but I really do n't like to get in the water , the ocean . I prefer a swimming pool . Well , I , I love to go and play around . At least I always did but although actually , my , I like the mountains . I , uh , -- Uh-huh . -- I do n't really like hot weather that 's my biggest gripe about living here .
