And there r- , there are s- , some substantial , nasty penalties , um , if you , if businesses try to avoid that . Uh , do you mean businesses from the point of view as , of , of selling things to a consumer and -- I- , MUMBLEx . -- then being responsible for the sales tax ? No . Businesses , uh -- Or purchasing . -- if purchasing things mail order , if , if I 'm a computer consulting firm and I see these , this great deal on forty-six mother boards , uh , from , from say Utah . Um , I , I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax . My a- , accounting department will at the end of the month . I think that i- , i- , I think that 's the way things work in Pennsylvania . And I know they work that way in , uh , say here in D C . Yeah . See I 'm unfamiliar with that because I do n't , I never see that end of the business . Yeah . So , my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer . Uh , but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for policing themselves , then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity f- , to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided . That 's true . I- , i- , a r- , a big hole does exist right now , uh , in that consumers can just say oh , I , I forgot that . There , there is no well defined mechanism at all and , and that it is a a l- , loss . I , I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism ju- , just to do just that in or- , in order to gain the revenue that 's being lost . Uh , I mean , I , I do n't know if I agree with that .
