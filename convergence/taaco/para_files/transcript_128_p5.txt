Yeah . It 's pretty good . But we take her to just about every movie , and , she , uh , she does really good . We 've taken her from real young , and she does real good . Like I said , we do n't take her to R -s . Uh-huh . So , if and when we ever get a baby-sitter , like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS , we go see it . I 's about to say , you 're not going to take her to that one , I 'm sure . Oh , no , no . Do you take her , or do you go to a lot of comedy movies or to , Yeah , yeah . What was the last comedy you saw ? Oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw ? Huh , huh , huh . Good question , good question .
