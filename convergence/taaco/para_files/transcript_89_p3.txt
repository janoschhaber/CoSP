Yeah , just as quickly . Yeah . Now I know my boss has bought the software , um , that he can , that his checkbook is on , on -- Uh-huh . -- on a disk , and he goes in and prin , and types his checks on the screen and then hits print , and they print out on the checks , and he 's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places -- Oh my gosh . -- you know , and he just whips , out , you know , I saw him yesterday morning over there , and , and he paid his monthly bills , and he just , you know , wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print and it printed out like ten checks , and he just , you know , they 're perforated , and he just ripped them off . They go through just a continuous thing on the printer -- Right . -- and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes and there they went . You know , and he said , you know , I can balance my checkbook in seconds , you know -- Right . -- because it 's all in the computer , you know . So . And you know there 's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make . That 's exactly why . He said , you know , he said , used to be I always sat looking for those , you know . He said this way there is n't any . You know , it does it for you . So . This , you know , there are some definitely , some , some advantages to it . It 's just a matter of , like you say , are the advantages , does it justify the cost , if you 're using it strictly for personal business . So . Right . I , I think in most cases I 'd have to say no . Not unless somebody really enjoys it . Right . Or perhaps is using it for education . I have a four year old son , and we have some education programs that he likes . A little Sesame Street one -- Yeah , yeah , -- and we have another one that plays music , and he really likes that one . As he grows up he 'll be even more and more too . That 's right . That 'll be great . And yeah , on , now I think about it , I guess for , for kids like , as they get older ,
