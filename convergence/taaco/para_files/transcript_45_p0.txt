Okay . So , who 's your , uh , favorite team ? Who do you think ? The Dallas Cowboys . The Dallas Cowgirls , huh . Yeah . Well , they did have a fairly decent year finally this year . Uh-huh . At least they 're coming around . Yeah , they 're going to get better . I mean , you know . Well I mean , you know , I think , uh , once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established , uh , they 'll do all right . Yeah . As long as Troy Ot- , Aikman does n't get hurt again . That kind of killed them at the end of the season last year . Uh-huh . So , I do n't , I do n't even know who your favorite team is , actually . I 'm a Viking fan . Okay . I think I did know that , I just forgot . Okay . And they have n't been doing too hot , so . Yeah . Has Herschel Walker done much for them ? No , in fact , in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal . Definitely . Well , he was a good player . I guess , well I do n't know , he just never , I do n't know , for a while there MUMBLEx , I 've never been over impressed with him . Well , he could always get past , you know , he 'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone . But , um , I guess you never could really see him play , because with the Cowboys , while he was with the team , the rest of the team was pretty poor
