Yeah . I 'm not thoroughly opposed to it . I still think it 's sort of true that a more civilized society would n't have to use capital punishment but I 'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought . You sound a lot like a friend of mine . A -- Uh-huh . -- a girl I hang out with . She has very , very black and white opinions , you know . There 's no gray in her opinions , you know . She , she probably would agree more with you but , but I do n't know . I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again . I 've never had a , a punishment or a , a crime like a murder touch my immediate family -- Uh-huh . -- but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to , to punish , especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they 've done . Yeah . And we see that more and more . Like in our state right now , there 's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl -- Uh-huh . -- you know , that 's fourteen years old . What 's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult .
