So , they 're really not full , full force into it , but they 're trying , so we 're attempting it , but I wish we could do more . Yeah , there 's , there 's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio . I used to work for the power company here and there was discussion for a while about , uh , building a garbage burning , uh , Uh-huh . electric generation plant but it just was n't cost effective , at the time . Oh . And there 's , there 's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city but there is n't any , uh , advertising campaign . There 's just not any push to recycle . Huh . I recycle my newspapers and , uh , alumi- , my aluminum stuff . Right , that 's what I do . But , uh , they make it as hard as possible , it 's not very convenient to do . Right , when they put centers and stuff like that .
