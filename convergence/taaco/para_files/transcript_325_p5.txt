and we 're going down to New Orleans and from Ohio since we 're right near Lake Erie this is going to be a switch for us for a week -- Yeah . -- going down there , and I think we 'll probably experience some of your weather although I think they have more humidity . But , um , Yeah . as far as the gardening and things like that goes I do n't know , uh , too much , too much about , uh , how much I really r- , do enjoy it myself . Do you like it at all ? I , well , not here . I mean it 's just , here I just ca n't stand to even get out in the , uh , in the dirt . Just , Well , how about when you were in Colorado ? Well , I liked it a little bit but I did n't , uh , I was working at that time full-time and did n't have a lot of time , Uh-huh . for that and so that I think really , um , hampered it a little bit . Well , and then , too , now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly . My water bill was high . And , uh , if you have that on a regular basis in Texas , I think I would go with something very dry to keep it off , you know . Yeah . But , uh , and with children , um , you probably do n't have time anyhow -- No . -- to , to get into it . Not really . It 's so , uh , okay , very good . . Uh-huh . I guess we 've kind of covered our subject matter , Sounds like i- , since neither one is really into gardening , are we ? No , no . Afraid not . Uh , hopefully they 'll give a subject I like one of these times . Right . Okay . Something I really know a lot about . Right . Wh , nice talking to you . Nice talking with you . Okay , bye-bye . Uh-huh , bye .
