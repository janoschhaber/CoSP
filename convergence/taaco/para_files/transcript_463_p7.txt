ours is the last street that they built on . So the houses actually on our street are a little bit , they 're kind of gone a little bit nicer . Oh , they have , it 's gotten , yeah . Yeah , I mean , just -- Yeah , oh . -- they , you know , it 's like the second phase -- Uh-huh . -- and , and so they 've kind of changed the , the codes a little bit , and so that 's kind of why , I guess , they stuck us with more brick when there were -- Um . -- other homes that did n't have any . Well , see , my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that , because they , they moved into a neighborhood and bought a , a real nice stone house down in South Austin . Oh , uh-huh . And , uh , and , the , what the builder apparently plans to do , is they , they do phase one , and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled , uh , codes and , and , and stuff , and then they come back in , and , and then they sell ,
