-- kind of woodworking do you do ? Well , k- , kind of , mainly the woodworking I 've done lately is , uh , made like , uh , for example a little nativity scene . Uh-huh . Uh , not the , uh , the whole figurines and so forth , but mainly the stable , put some shelves in and , and some odd stuff around the house and so I , I enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking and I do it out of hobby more than , uh , you know , something I have to do . How about yourself ? Uh , well , I like to think of it as a hobby , but I , I guess also , partly out of necessity . Just repairing things around the house . Uh , a few years ago , uh , we needed , uh , they needed some book shelves and I kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves and , uh , it actually worked pretty well and over the years I 've , I 've refined those plans . I got myself a router and I 'm , I 'm very good at making book shelves . Uh-huh . It 's , it 's also a way of relieving stress . My wife kind of laughs , at me that anytime I get stressed out I just go out in the garage and we 've got more book shelves . Well , I 'll have to come and see them . That sounds like a good idea . I , you know , and that 's , that is right ,
