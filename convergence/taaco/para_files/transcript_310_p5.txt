Uh-huh . -- I think are , are his two favorites that we 've got . Uh-huh . And there 's some , I think there 's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video , uh , SHIPWRECKED . Oh , I have n't , I did n't hear that was coming out . Uh-huh . Yeah , it 's fixing to come out on video and , boy , I ca n't think of the other one that 's fixing to come out . Well , they just had -- But , -- uh , THE RESCUERS movie -- Uh-huh . -- that was a Disney movie , was n't it . I think I heard that was just one , was just out . He 's , uh , he does n't sit still for the whole movie , yet , but -- Right . -- he likes to , uh , to listen to the music and stuff if there 's a lot of that in the m- , in the movie . Uh-huh . Well , I 'm glad to know that there 's somebody else out there that does n't get to go to the movie theater . Well , I w- , tell you , ever s- , my , my kids are just small babies and , I tell you , we really want to go -- Yeah . -- a lot and , uh , there 's so much out on video now , that it 's almost , you know , the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it . Uh-huh . Sometimes . So . And then they go to the dollar movies . Uh-huh . That seems to happen . I noticed that DANCES WITH WOLVES was playing at the , uh , Granada Theater . Uh-huh . And , uh , someone said that was a lot of fun to go do . You can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie . I thought that might be kind of fun to do . Yeah , that does sound fun . And , of course , you need a baby-sitter for that . Definitely . But , uh , no , I 'd really like to get out to the movies more often . Course , it 's so expensive , now , too -- Right . -- that you ca n't hardly afford it .
