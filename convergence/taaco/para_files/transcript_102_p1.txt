the assumption is that it is a problem , uh , and I 've never actually had too many people explain to me why it 's a problem , though I have the same instinctual feeling that it 's a problem and , uh , but it 's not clear to me that it is . Uh , bo- , Um , it 's a problem if those voting do n't represent the population demographically , or in terms of their opinions . But if those who do n't vote , if you made them vote and , it those who do n't vote would have voted exactly the same way , you know , in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other , just like everyone who did vote , it 's not clear to me that it is really a problem , um . Um , that 's , that 's interesting , because I had thought , I ha- , feel that it 's a problem also , but , I see your point on that . I mean , I , I assume that those who do n't vote , I mean if you look at the break down of those who do n't vote , they tend to be , you know , poor blacks , for example , vote very little , and things like that and I assume that they would vote differently if they were voting , than your average voter . But I do n't know if that 's the case . Uh . In fact I 've heard of studies that suggest that that is n't . Apparently they do n't think it 's a problem .
