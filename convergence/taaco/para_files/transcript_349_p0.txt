Real excited when I heard this . So far I 've been trying to call all day because I keep getting these subjects like capital punishment so -- Oh , yes . -- football , I love this . This is great . Well , we 're from Colorado so we 're Bronco fans . And , um , we just moved here two years ago and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here and they lost again . That was pretty pitiful , but they seem to be doing pretty good this year . Well , I was from Illinois originally , and I grew up a Bear fan . And , uh , then we moved here even when we knew we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans . Oh . And we had some wonderful , wonderful years there under Roger Staubach . And we kind of got spoiled . Yeah . We expected it to continue forever . I think they 're doing pretty well this year though . Well , they have n't , they have n't , have they just lost one game this year ? I think two . Two . I know they lost , yeah , to Washington and Philadelphia . Yeah . But they 're not doing bad . People are pretty surprised that they , I mean they beat the Giants .
