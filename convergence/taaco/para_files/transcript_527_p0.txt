Anyway , uh . How about you . What do you do with your budget ? What do I do , uh , at the moment it 's under chaos . Uh , right now I 'm just , uh , I , I do n't really have a budget per se . I 'm , I , uh , it 's called living within your means . Uh-huh . You know , which means at the moment , paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car does n't collapse . Yeah . That 's true . Uh , but , uh , no I do n't really have a budget at the moment . Uh , but I have uh , I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month and then I do n't , usually do n't exceed that unless I , unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another , like if I have car expenses and then that , then it goes through the moon , so . Yeah , that 's sort of a problem . Yeah , so uh , what do yo- , We 're trying , we 're trying to , uh , so far we are in the clear credit wise but , uh , the other side of it is , so , not much on that side of it to add to it . We 're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that but , So you can afford to get a house ? Yeah , we 'd like to do that some day . We have this dream . Yeah . But , we do n't know how long it will be a dream . We , we 're kind of real , we 're real happy that we do n't have any debt , but we 're at the same time we 're real scared about incurring it in this , uh , economy right now so -- Yeah . -- we 're stepping real careful and trying to see what 's the best way to save what , the little bit that we do get , you know , on top of expenses every month . So , what do you and your husband do ? We 're missionaries actually . Are you really ? Yeah , uh-huh . And , uh , it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have , uh , like , uh , uh , support quota -- Um . -- and it 's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here . No kidding . And it does n't get switched very easily once you come home . I see . So ,
