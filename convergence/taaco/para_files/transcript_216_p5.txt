It 's pretty dry . We get some when it 's this rainy , but it 's nothing like , I guess , San Antonio Summers , it 's nothing like Houston . Uh-huh . MUMBLEx or East Texas , is a little more humid . Yeah . It seems like San Antonio is increasing in humidity over the years , because I had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years , Uh-huh . and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid , more and more humid .
