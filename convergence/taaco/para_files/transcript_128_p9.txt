and I guess that I thought was a real good acting and writing job both , you know , because I think , or directing job . I think they did a real good job of that . Uh-huh . And James Woods , I think is who it was , did an excellent job as the cop . I mean , you know , he just , Yeah , I like him . Yeah , and there were , there were some definite , um , should I say , tense moments , with him in there . Probably the last comedy we saw , now that I think about it , is HOME ALONE . Yes , I , I , I had seen it before Christmas , but I took a date to it , uh , about a month ago . So , I , I , I 've seen it the second time not too long ago . So . It was really cute . I really enjoyed it . Of course , the bad thing about it was , uh , the second time I saw it , I did n't really enjoy it as much , and I was kind of surprised at that . I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over . Yeah . But before , maybe it 's just the idea of my reaction to the first time . I had laughed so hard I was hoarse .

It , you have to see those twice to catch everything . Well , you have to see them more than that . Yeah , yeah . I , I , I still catch things in AIRPLANE that I did n't catch . Yeah . I mean , it 's amazing -- I do too . -- I love those movies -- I do too . -- I really do . So I 'm looking forward to seeing that -- Yeah . -- because that looks hilarious ,
