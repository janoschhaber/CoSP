Well , I guess I could use a card too . I live , uh , very near , uh , very close to the Firewheel Golf Course . Oh , do you ? So you live in Garland then . Yes , I live in northwest Garland . Right up there near the golf course . Okay , well we are in south Garland , but yeah , next time you go , uh , you know , check into it , they have , uh , it is just like , uh , a bus card and they just punch it . You know , it has got one through ten on it and every time you go they just punch it for you . Well , in the last two years , I have not played very much golf because I am involved in Boy Scouts . Oh , okay . So , I have , uh , I have , uh , I have children -- You must have a , a son . -- Boy Scout age . I have two boys that are boy scout age , and , uh , so -- Oh , okay . -- I am very active in Boy Scouts so I would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby . Yeah . But I -- Oh well that sounds like fun too . -- but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get to use them again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college . Uh-huh . Well , you need to , uh , teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you . That 's right . Lessons are expensive though . Oh , yeah . Well you can teach them .
