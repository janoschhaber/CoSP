I think that might be true . Yeah . I do n't like pulling a cart on Firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path . I know , and that makes me so mad . You know , it is like it is not going to do that much damage to the course , but apparently they think differently . That is the reason , I do n't play over there . Yeah . I like the course , but I do n't play over there because , you , they do n't , uh , you know do n't allow you to pull a cart . Right . And , I do n't think a cart damages the turf . Right . Well , the reason why we play over there is because it 's where , since we are a Garland resident , they gave us a special deal where you can get , uh , ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars , yeah , a hundred dollars cause it is half price what the normal green fees are . Uh-huh . So that is why we you know play over there cause we have got our card .
