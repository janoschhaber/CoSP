Yeah . and see if he could build a Seven Forty-Seven out of it . See what we can come up with . Do you like the , uh , news shows , TWENTY TWENTY , SIXTY MINUTES , those kind of things ? Well , uh , I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES as a matter of fact , and uh , and I used to like the show very much . Uh-huh . But , unfortunately I find getting rid of your T V set , you do throw out some , some of the baby , Some of the -- with the bath water . -- little things , yeah . And uh , I just decided I had to do that . I think , in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it , I mean I could just sit mindlessly in front of a T V set for hours . Uh . And I just realized , I was sort of like an alcoholic , if I did n't get the booze out of the house , I was going to drink . Oh . So . I guess I have n't ever had any trouble with that . I have more or less , I have my favorite shows and I usually make time in my day or my week , you know , to watch those . Yeah . But , for the most part , I try , I have small kids and I try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time , really when they 're up . Yeah , yeah . Because they 're , I guess that , that , that falls MUMBLEx , and one of my other favorite shows is SESAME STREET because of the kids . I like that real well .
