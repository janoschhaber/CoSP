I 'm , you might say I 'm , uh , uh , good back yard mechanic and I , you know , I took auto shop in high school , it 's been a while back , but I , I still have a pretty good feel for it , but one thing I did n't know is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars , I , I had bigger cars and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those and what I was surprised at is that on my little Nissan I bought the truck with about sixty thousand , I have almost one hundred and ten , so I drove on those brake pads for , uh , you know , forty-five thousand miles and there was hardly any wear to them . So those small little trucks and cars like that , they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good . You know , they 've gotten to the point that where they do n't weigh very much and the the -- Exa- , -- surface materials on the pads is so good . Exactly , so I , you know , I just did it anyway . I like to , I like to stay up on it . You know , like I just kind of stay up on it and then if you go and like , just about any point , any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil , the oil is you might say , uh , a white golden brown .

Well -- So , so how , -- it sounds like you 've had some good experiences with that -- Uh-huh . -- uh , and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that . Oh , oh . Uh , I , I get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car and , uh -- Uh-huh . -- and in fact I have an eighty-seven Mustang with a three O two in it -- Uh-huh . -- that I 've , uh , beefed up a little bit --
