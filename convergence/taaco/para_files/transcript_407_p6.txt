we went by . That 's the first time I 'd seen it . It looked really nice . Yeah . A lot of trees there . It looked like a pretty little , a sight . Hang on a minute . Sure . . No , I do n't think so , Yeah , Patty might . I 'm back . Oh , sure . Di- , But how did you get on it ? Well , my husband works at T I over on Central . Oh . Uh , why we 're living in Arlington I 'm not so sure but , he works over there and tha- , we did it last time . Uh-huh . And , uh , so I 'm , just my daughter and I are registered this time . I do n't know , they did n't even ask him back . Really ? That was weird , was n't it ? Huh . But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time . Uh-huh . I do n't get too many . And I can never find anybody . Huh . So , um , The first time I used to get calls from far away too . Right . Like Maryland , Uh-huh . and New Jersey , and but now it just seems like it 's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from . Yeah , I 've had the same experiences , Uh-huh . all right around here . Uh-huh . Yeah , I do n't know , uh , I wonder if they really , I do n't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents . There 's just , there 's so many with this one town -- Uh-huh . Uh-huh .
