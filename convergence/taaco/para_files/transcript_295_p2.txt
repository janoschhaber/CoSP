-- really like it . I love it . I really do . And your daughter is going to be a sophomore . That 's correct . I have two daughters , but my oldest will be , will be a sophomore . Is , uh , because you live in Austin , is she thinking about the University of Texas ? She has her heart set on U T . And , uh , you know , having gone to the University of Minnesota , I know what a big university is like . And , uh , one thing that I did this summer , which I thought might benefit both my daughters is , my youngest daughter got involved in band , and Baylor has a band camp . Oh . So she went for a week , and it was overnight , and they lived in the dorms . And I thought this would expose both of them to what it 's , you know , like on a coll- , a smaller college campus . And , uh , my oldest one just was n't impressed at all with the idea of a small school . So , uh , I , I , I still think the exposure was good .
