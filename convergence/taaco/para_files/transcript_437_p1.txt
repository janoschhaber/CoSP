they are . Um , my , my real concern with , uh , uh , why I 'm not sure I want to buy a Honda , is because I have to make a kind of a , a steady , um , trip down the road about once a month , because I 'm divorced and I have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina -- Um , uh-huh . -- and , uh , I drive , down Interstate Ninety-five , and it 's just an absolutely wild highway . Ninety-five is wild in any car . There 's no doubt about that -- Yeah and , -- because I , I , I run over to Crystal City , or used to , I 'm retiring the end of this month -- Uh-huh . -- but I 'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there . And , you , well , you 've got it , and , uh , so having precious cargo in the car with me , as you can well imagine , it 's very hard for me to imagine that , that , uh , a Honda 's going to be as safe a car as , as the one that I 've got my eye on , which is a Volvo . Uh-huh , uh-huh . In , in fact , quite frankly I 've owned a Volvo in the past , and -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I 've , I 've , they 're expensive cars to keep up when they need service , but , uh , I 've found that I 've had a lot of luck with them . Uh , course I 'm a mechanically inclined kind of person , and I always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that , you know , need to be taken care of , and so forth . And I guess that 's one thing that , that recommends the Honda to a lot of people , is is there 's just very little that you have to do under the hood , and , uh , Yes , it just , just sits there and purrs , and you , all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter . I get six hundred miles on a tank of gas . Oh , I know . It 's really amazing . Yeah .
