Yeah . It will come up a lot easier if you do n't wait too long . And I 've , I was told , I always used the nice wide masking tape , but I 've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth . Oh really , okay . Because it , it rips as you pull it off for one thing and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape . Um . And the whole point of using it is to save yourself work . You can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape .
