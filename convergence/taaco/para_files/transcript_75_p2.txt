Yeah . I have n't heard whether it 's going to rain or not . I think there 's an eighty percent chance this evening , but it 's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest will be without rain . Well , that 's good . But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties , and the lows in the forties . That 's getting back to a little bit chillier . Yeah , that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year . I think , I have n't seen the wea- , the weather on the news in the evening lately , but I think the average high would be , should be about seventy . Yeah . I 'm not certain either , but you 're probably right . Yeah . Well , I like it when it 's sort of a medium temperature , uh , maybe seventy-five to eighty , somewhere in there . I do n't like it when it 's too cool or too warm . I 'm much more apt to get things done when it 's at that sort of in between temperature . Yeah , that 's true . Um , one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high . Um . And what that tells me , is that the summer weather is very predictable , that it does n't vary very much . Yeah . You 're probably right . I mean , any other time of year , that 's not the case , because it could be very warm or very cold .
