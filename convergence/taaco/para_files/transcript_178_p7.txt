and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come . Yeah . I 'm sure , you know , my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia , but I , I sure am scared of them Giants . Well , that 's true . Those guys are tough . They are tough and they 're big , they 're mean and they are going to come right through you if you do n't do something . Yeah . That , that sure was a fun Super Bowl to watch this year . Oh , yeah , yeah . I mean , I was n't pulling for either team . No , no . But that was just a good football game . And it 's funny , you know . You like to pull for the underdog and for a long time I was pulling for Denver . Uh-huh . Uh , Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes , because of some of the stupid stuff he does , but he 's a good quarterback . He 's got a good arm , sometimes it 's too good because he throws too hard . L A you mean ? I mean L A , sorry . Boy , speaking of Denver , on another subject , I 've been up there like five times in the last three , four weeks . Oh , yeah ? Yeah we 've been trying get this new D N B two thousand printer up and running . Has it been , uh , snowing up there ? Oh , boy I was just up there , I just got back last night around eleven thirty or so , and it was about seven inches of snow on the ground . Wow . And it snowed all day . Well , that will make the skiers happy . Oh , yeah , yeah . If , if it snowed that much in Denver you know they got that much up in the mountains , you know , just west of there . Oh , you bet . Oh , yeah , up around the Keystone and Copper Mountain , those guys will love that . Well , good to talk to you . Yeah , enjoyed it Bob . You guys have a good time , keep those printers coming . Hey , we 'll do it . All right , bye . Bye .
