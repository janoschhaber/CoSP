my dad bought one of these little Nash Metropolitans here a few years ba- , quite a few years back , and the thing had a Austin Heeley type engine , you know , it was Austin motors engine and running gear . Right . And the body was built by Nash , or who , you know , Ameri- , that was even before American Motors , but Nash , essentially , in the U S somewhere . And that thing had the darndest combination of metric and Wentworth and , uh , S A E . He ended up with about three sets of tools -- He just get one more MUMBLEx . -- in order to work on that fool thing . Because I think the Wentworth and the S A E bolt sizes were the same , but the threads were different , and , uh -- Oh , that would be a mess . -- it was a total mess . And on my Chevy van that 's a couple of years old . Part of it 's built in Canada . Matter of fact , the thing is , I always say it 's built off shore , you know , because it was assembled in Canada . The only thing that was in it was built in the U S was the , uh , differential , and it was built in Buffalo , New York . But it 's got the hardest combination of , uh , metric and , most of the body parts seem to be metric , and most of the engine parts seem to be S A E , so . It 's just crazy . Right . It just gets bad , now , you got to , you got to have one , and not mix them up . Yeah . Because you 're never going to get to one , one system if you still got a , got a mix . And of course , here that , that would involve changing road signs all across the country , you know , miles per hour to kilometers per hour , and the whole nine yards . Kind of hard to do gradually . I thought maybe they would convert to , uh , metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit , because what is it --
