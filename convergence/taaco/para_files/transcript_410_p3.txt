if I was looking at a U S map , I would say it was sort of reminds me of , of a , uh , it 's not as big as California proportionately . Uh-huh , uh-huh . But , but , but it 's , it 's more significant , in the sense of , it 's a great agricultural region . Oh , I see , oh , I , I did n't really know that , I know a lot of their , oh , their countries that they had overtaken , or wanted to be independent or several of them , right , Yeah . And , uh , what about Astonia , are they , They 're completely out now . Right , I thought they were . Yes , the three , the three Baltic , uh , republics got out as quickly as they could . But , but , the , the Ukraine is especially significant because it , of the agriculture ? Right , it 's , it 's very important for the economics of the whole , of the Soviet Union . Uh , so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could . Right , uh , except they ca n't fight . No , they do n't , It 's done democratically , uh , And Bush has already given his opinion on it , right ? Yes . Did n't I read that ? Yes . So , now , uh , not that they may , that may matter , I do n't know , anymore . I , uh , fear for the Russians from what I read , you know , I wonder how they 're going to get through the winter . Uh , Food wise or any wise , sounds to me like they 'll start rioting soon , or not that that would do any good , but I guess people do that when they 're desperate . That , that 's true , uh , has n't happened here for a while , but it , uh , Well , that 's true , since the Depression , I guess when the veterans went to Washington -- Uh-huh . -- and well , you know , the war riots , of course .
