So . Yeah . But , then I just , you know , bundle it up and put it on the front , you know , the front walk ev- , -- Yeah . -- you know , every Monday or every other Monday , and have them pick that up , but that 's the extent of what I 've done . I 'd like to be able to do more . The problem is , with a lot of it is , you have to go , you know , it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it , you know -- Yeah see , and , -- it 's not always convenient to do it . Yeah , see , and here in Lubbock everything 's so close . I can imagine what it 's like up there . Yeah , I 'm not exactly sure where the , you know , the can thing is , but , you know , sometimes it 's just so , seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash , and have -- Yeah . -- them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them . See , I went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago , as a matter of fact , and got me one of those little can crushers that I could put on the wall -- Uh-huh . -- and then I put me a little five gallon bucket , and it 's just outside the garage door -- Uh-huh . -- so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket .
