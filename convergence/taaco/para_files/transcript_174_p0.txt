Okay . The public school systems , well everybody 's kno- , has known they 've needed renovation for years , but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it . Uh-huh . The first direction that I can see , or I wish , I would love to see them go with . Kids learn at different rates and for too long they 've kind of lumped everybody together . You 'd learn at this rate and that 's the only way it 's going to happen . Yeah . That 's true . You 've got some kids that 'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you 're talking about it , and the re- , the other fifty-seven minutes you 've been talking about a subject , you 've bored them . Yeah , yeah , that 's , that 's very true . Um , I guess I can relate to that , because I have two kids that are opposites like that . Uh , one picks up real quick and the other one does n't . And you 're right , they do get bored , uh , really fast , if they already know what you 're talking about . What do you propose that they do ? What , what is your suggestions ? The educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with , uh , the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person . Uh-huh . Out of each child . Out of each child . Each individual child . Some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff .
