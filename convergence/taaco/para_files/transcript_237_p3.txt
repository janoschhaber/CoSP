and I really enjoyed that because , you know , the mountains were real close , Uh-huh . we like the , we like the white mountains and , Yeah . Uh , unfortunately , I did n't really get to go skiing much while I was there . I went skiing once . Yeah , we loved the , we loved the , the New Jersey area , too , because the the lakes were really pretty close , you know , you could , Uh-huh . you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and , and just really , and then we were n't too for from the Appalachian Trail , we did quite a bit of hiking , which is kind of fun . Are you a , you a hiker , or not ? Uh , Not so much , huh ? Not , not really so much . If , if , if there was some place that , that we went to where there was hiking involved , I , I would be you know , happy to go hiking , Uh-huh . but we , we never have really planned a vacation around , uh , places to go hiking . So your , your next , your plans are try to find someplace to s- , scuba dive . Yeah . Our next vacation will , will be scuba diving , I 'm sure . You have any children ? No , not yet . Okay , then that 's probably one of the reasons our , we had little children all the time , Yeah . so some of the things are not as , quite as , uh , adaptable . Yeah , it 's a , it 's a little more , difficult planning a vacation , Yeah , it is . when you have , have children . You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy , too ,
