Uh , I know the institutions do n't work that well , but it 's a bad day because I get all these kids through my office . I have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids . Uh-huh . Five hundred of them are good , solid kids and I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day . Um . And a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible . Some of them in the penal system . So that 's a difficult situation . And , you know , you just see those kids going down the road .
