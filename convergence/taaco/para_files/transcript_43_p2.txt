Uh , uh , what I 'm thinking about is back , well , when I was a kid , and much earlier than that , kids were kind of , i- , i- , you know , the parents kind of pushed them to join , like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts and they did , do , do do a lot of public service activities , but these days they 're not , uh , par- , parents are n't encouraging their kids to do things like that . Because when I was in the Girl Scouts , we did a lot of public service things , because that 's just part o- , of , of the scouting , and , you know . Yeah , I 've , I 've , that 's really great . I , I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent , two excellent organizations . They are but parents , You know , kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that , Yeah , they do . and they do n't follow it at all , you know . There are very few Scouts go on , Oh , no .
