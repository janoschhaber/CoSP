Uh , a- , and that was the thing that , uh , killed Dukakis back , uh , four years ago when someone asked him a similar question and he , he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when , uh , people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion -- Uh-huh . -- uh , a gut level reaction . And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level . Uh , you know , whether it be a biblical force , uh , you know , the eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a life for a knife , life type logic or just , uh , uh , some sort of anger at putting peop- , putting , uh , murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life , uh , while we foot the bill . Yeah . I think people are , are working at that from more of a , uh , a gut reaction than a , a reason humane one . See , I do n't think the decisions that are going to be made on dea- , on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do . Are they reformatories , where we 're trying to take people who ca n't survive or , or that , that are n't conforming enough to society so that , that we work well together .
