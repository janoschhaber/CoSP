Why do n't you go ahead and start . Okay . Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement . Uh , trial by jury is good but a lot of time i- , a lot of cases , uh , is circumstantial evidence that , that convicts a person , which I do n't think is all the time good . Because sometimes it 's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent , I mean prove a person guilty if you do n't really know or you do n't really have an eyewitness . And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me . I do n't know . So you think if , if trials were held by judges or experts , that they , they would tend not to , uh , admit , not to convict people on circumstantial evidence ? I think so . You know , I , I attended a trial in , uh , Germany when I was a student and , uh -- Uh-huh . -- that 's the sort of system they have . The trials are held by a panel of three , uh , three or four judges who are , well , they 're like lawyers I guess . They 're experts in the law -- Right . -- and , uh , there , there really is n't a jury and , uh , uh , they do the questioning also . The judges do the questioning and , uh -- Uh-huh . -- they , uh , i- , I think it 's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they , uh , uh , the judge is also sort of a jury , uh , but I 'm not sure I like that .
