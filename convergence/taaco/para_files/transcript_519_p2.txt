Every six months I have to pay car insurance . Uh , every six months I have to pay my taxes . So -- Uh-huh . -- I take a set amount . I 've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh , uh , saving in and I also have got a checking account besides that , but , what I do on my money market account , my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month . I will just take two hundred and twenty out and I put it in parenthesis . I take it out of the right line total -- Uh-huh . -- and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up . Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it . Then when the tax bill comes in I 've got that much set aside . Right . And I guess that 's a way of budgeting . Yeah .
