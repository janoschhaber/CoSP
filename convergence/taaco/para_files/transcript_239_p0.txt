Yeah , uh-huh . Hello . Uh-huh . Oh , I 'm sorry I must have got the other line cut off . Uh , so , they 've been doing that it for a while now -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , it , I live in an apartment -- Uh-huh . -- and my ap- , facilities , there it is , hold on . Uh-huh . Hello . . Okay , sorry about that . Yeah , okay , you 're okay , Yeah . okay . Uh , anyhow , they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only . Uh , I 've been recycling for maybe about two years now and , at ano- , ano- , another public facility -- Uh-huh . -- where they have , you know , recycling of glass , uh , aluminum and paper . Now , Have you , have you cycled , recycled plastic also ? No , and that 's what I , I do n't understand exactly why they do n't have that option . We , we have out here -- Uh-huh . -- uh , up until just this last year in on you are town there was n't any really good way , they had some bends , Uh-huh . around that we could find and put them in but not all that many , it was n't very well advertised -- Uh-huh . -- but recently , uh , the refuse department has , has , uh , is working on getting a system going where we will actually have , uh , a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things -- Uh-huh . -- so it , it should be good , uh , Uh-huh . I think it 's a marvelous idea when you think of , uh , when I just think of the papers that I dump out -- Uh-huh . -- I mean there just , it 's such a I waste ,
