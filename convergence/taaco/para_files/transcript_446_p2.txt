So , I 've just recently had to start looking at it myself . Yeah . So , it 's a small problem so far , but I guess you just have to keep on top of it . What kind of roof do you have ? Uh , we 're in , uh , campus apartment buildings with flat top , uh . Oh , then you do n't have to do too much with it . Not too much . They 're just tar and gravel -- Uh-huh . -- treated flat top roofs . Have you got pretty well pitch on that roof , or is it pretty steep ? Oh , it 's pretty steep . Uh , parts of it are steeper than others . What do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal ? Well , uh , you wear , uh , shoes with good traction , and , and , and try to remember where you are at all times . Yeah , I imagine , I imagine . And remember to yell Geronimo , if all else fails . Yeah , yeah , that would be just too much of a fall for me . Um , have you been , uh , was , was the house reasonably new , or you been doing some remodeling work on it . It 's actually just twelve years old , now . That 's pretty new house yet . Yeah , it , uh , this part of the country , actually , they say that when the house is , uh , fifteen , it 's already old , but just take good care of it . Yeah . Thing is , we 've , uh , the main thing that we 've had with this house recently has been some , uh , squirming , I call it , of the foundation . We 're just on a concrete slab , you know -- Yeah . -- but , uh , the soil right under this is a clay , and it , uh , It 's settling unevenly ?
