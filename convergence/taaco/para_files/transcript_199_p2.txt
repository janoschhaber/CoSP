-- one of them is where you just take whatever 's already standard and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter . Yeah , yeah , direct conversion . I , I do n't know . Uh . I think they just ought to , you know , start , uh , just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever , you know , start your packaging , go to liters instead of quarts , and you know , people if they have to are going to learn to think that way . Well do n't most of them , does n't just about everything now have both metric and English . They do , but things are generally packaged in the English sized packages , you know . You buy a quart of milk , and sure it has , has the metric equivalent written on there , but it still a quart . Oh , yeah , yeah . But if they started putting it in liters , liter of oil , and you know , liters of gasoline , people are going to learn to think in metric . As long as you can still buy a product in the English units , that 's how you 're going to think of it . I kind of remember back when gas prices started up , you know , pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range ,
