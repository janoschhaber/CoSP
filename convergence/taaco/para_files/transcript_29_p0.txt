Okay , well , my favorite , probably , all time T V show is STAR TREK . And I would MUMBLEx it like that , I , I like the adventure of it . Uh-huh . And the idea that , that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space . Uh-huh . And then I like the , they have a new one now . The STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION . Right . Which it 's an all new cast , but kind of the same idea , going out to new places and , and doing new things and finding out about different people , and I 've , I 've always liked that show probably the very best . Uh-huh . I think I 've actually seen a number of STAR TREKS , one way or another over the years . Uh , although I never watched it regularly . I 'm certainly acquainted with the character -- Uh-huh . -- the characters . And then I 've seen some of the STAR TREK movies . Yeah , those , the movies are good too . And I , I guess all , most of the shows I like are , are kind of along the same line because they 're all adventure . Uh-huh . When I , when I started thinking about this , that those are some of my favorite shows , MCGYVER , because it 's , it 's only one person there , more than , uh , you know , instead of a cast -- Uh-huh . -- of people , but he 's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap , and grabbing what he can and , you know , pieces of baling wire and , and a few tires and all of a sudden he 's got a hang glider and , I do n't think I , I 've even heard of that show . You have n't ? It 's called MCGYVER ? Uh-huh . And what is , what is he ?
