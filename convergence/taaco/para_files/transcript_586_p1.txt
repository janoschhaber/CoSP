and states c , can use all the revenue they can get . With some , with something like that , d , do your arguments still apply ? Well , I think that if , if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion , then I do n't argue with it . Because it 's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh , I bought this out of state . I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania . Which is exactly what businesses do at the present . Right . But the point is is that businesses do that . The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question . That 's a cost of doing business . The burden -- And I , I -- -- should n't be placed on the consumer . -- I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having , having to pay sales tax on it . Uh . That 's my understanding of the way , uh , the way it works . Usually , the , the person ordering does n't pay . But the accounting department will , uh , suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay .
