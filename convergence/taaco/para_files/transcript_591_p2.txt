Do it remotely just looking at the , what they do , they do several different types of things . Sometimes they put a source light and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by , you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually . Huh . And ... Now where does the source light go ? Like across the street . They 'll set up -- Oh , I see . -- like a trap or something like that in some sense . And they 're also looking at , uh , other , you know , ways of monitoring this and , cause they 've found out something basically that , uh , and a poorly tuned car can emit something , it 's an incredible amount . It was like four hundred times as much -- Jeez . -- uh , of certain pollutants , and it was like unburned hydrocarbons , then a properly tuned car . And , and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars , well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the , the pollution then , you know , you , it 'd be one way to cut the pollution in half . Yeah . That 's neat .
