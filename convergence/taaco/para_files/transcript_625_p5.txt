Like the guy in California got thir- , you know , twice before he went to the gas chamber and then they said okay , no , you do n't have to go . And then they took him back . I mean , it just seems , Jeez , that 's a lot of repeals . Yeah , it just seemed a little inconsistent . And then you have like two , you have these people who are serial killers that did n't even get the death sentence back when -- Uh-huh . -- ever you know . Yeah . I do n't know .

Do they , uh , do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence ? No , I do n't , I do n't think , uh , the military does n't execute anymore so . Yeah .
