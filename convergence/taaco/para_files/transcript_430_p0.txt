Okay . You think you 're getting your money 's worth ? Uh , never . Uh , the only thing I 'm , I 'm thankful of is that we do n't have to pay any income tax in , in Texas . Well , that 's probably the next year 's agenda . Yeah . Boy , I tell you what , I sure hope they do n't pass something like that . Oh , yeah . They 're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around , and I , I think one way or the other , we 're going to pay for the bureaucracy , I guess . Uh , it 's one area that is really , I , I think hurting the economy more than anything .
