I 'm , I 'm sort of mixed on this . I think that the , the answer may lie in , uh , not in so much a , uh , national kind of medical thing that li- , like England has but more of a , um , national insurance , uh , sort of clearinghouse or whatever . I think that , uh , too many , uh , the problem with , with right now is w- , that we 've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through and , and I think that , I think you , you mentioned Canada . I think that they have a system where , uh , they , the government deals with the , with , I mean , you , you go to whoever you want but file through one , one s- , particular , Um , I see . uh , setup and that way they , they are able to reduce prices because they 've , you know , it 's , it 's all one , one centralized thing . Yeah . Well , I , I think that , uh , again having gone through a period when I was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own , if you do n't have a company supporting you in the , uh , picking up the major portion of your health insurance , Uh-huh .
