they 're not all boys and right now we do n't have a girls ' league because I 'm the one that 's supposed to start one and I just have n't gotten around to doing it . I keep saying we need to have one . They go , okay , then start one . But everybody MUMBLEx wants to do it but , you know , God 's sitting on my heart and I just had n't gotten around to doing it , but anyway , so they could really only have four members on the team . I think they only have four boys . I do n't even think they have but two old enough to play yet . Uh-huh . But , um , then you did n't believe me about her kids are the they are so good . I 'm not kidding you but she does work with them and it 's a commitment
