Um , I , in college I took , uh , four years of classical guitar , and I played in the , in the jazz combo all four years . I play guitar -- Oh , yeah ? -- for the jazz combo . So , uh , that 's where my two , my two listening enjoyments are , but , you know , jazz can get on my nerves after a while .

Yeah , unless , unless you 're playing it , it just , it just does n't do anything . What about the blues or something like that ? Uh , uh , blues are okay . I , I tell you , I do like , um , I grew up on blue grass music . My dad is a big blue grass fan , and so -- Uh-huh . -- um , I would n't have admitted it when I was in high school but , -- -- I really do like it a lot . So . I , I like some of it , um , as far as like the cou- , what they now call country western , it does n't sound like the old country music at all , does it ? No , it does n't , it does n't . Um , some of it sounds more like pop music . Yeah , uh , they 've all got , you know , the real screechy electric guitars now . Oh , n- , yeah , Yeah . If I 'm going to listen to today 's country western , I have tapes of like Randy Travis and Clint Black and -- Uh-huh . -- I even liked Jim Reeves -- Uh-huh . -- you know -- Yeah , I , I , yeah , -- or , uh , what , what Merle Haggard -- Uh-huh . -- and Faron Young --
