Well , I , I do n't think that it 's , it 's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions . For instance , jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there 's , where there 's , uh , endangerment to their own life and other people 's lives . Uh , I agree with that . People that are , uh , driving -- Uh-huh . -- like , uh , truck drivers and things like that . I definitely think they should be tested . And I 'm not , I 'm not opposed to any testing . I mean because I know I certainly would n't want to , to , uh , you know , be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or , or you know , because he was on drugs while he was there . Yeah . Uh ... Well , how do you , how do you feel about , uh , companies drug testing prior to hiring ? Oh , uh , I was tested , uh , within my company . I think it 's kind of a push to , uh , weed out drugs in states
