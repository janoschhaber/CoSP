Oh , really ? Uh-huh . If it 's like , you know , really a , you know , a lower paying job , you know , where in a small town you do n't obviously you do n't need as much as far as to , you know , to live . And this is money that she 's borrowed to form her college education ? Yeah , she only taught there one year but I , But she got credits for it ? Uh-huh . That 's very interesting . And , um , I think it would be , I know that also one of my cousins who , uh , he is in like the therapy type thing and he was , um , some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at , uh , uh , I mean , it 's a nursing home or something like that .
