Right , and , you know , we ca n't really depend on the police to solve all this , they just ca n't do it . Yeah . I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family -- Right . -- to a certain extent and , uh , and how we going to bring that back together . Yeah , that 's , I thi- , I agree , I think that 's where it stems from , is that and , um , you know , you 've got a lot of , a lot more women that are working nowadays -- Uh-huh . -- that are n't home with the children -- Right and , -- and that may impact it as well . I think so , and , and then there 's a drop in , uh , the training of morals , really , you know . Right , right . These , some of these young kids you read about , just does n't bother them to kill someone at all -- Yeah -- -- I think -- -- they do n't think twice about it . -- I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals , you know -- Yeah . -- would n't kill somebody in cold blood . Either that or I do n't know if it happened and it was n't as highly publicized as it is now , or what the , what the , I think it was just rare , I really do . Uh-huh .

No , I 'm the one , Himself and her ? Yeah , that must have been at least fifty years ago or more , but -- Oh , wow , -- the point of the story is that , that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers , all over the country for weeks --
