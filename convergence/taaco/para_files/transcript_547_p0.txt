Okay . So , uh , Mike , what are your opinions on , uh , trial by jury ? Well I work for an insurance company so I see a lot of , uh , verdicts that are pretty crazily decided . Um , by juries particularly , and I know in England the judges set all of the awards . You know juries will decide the guilt or innocence , but then they leave the awards up to more learned people . And I think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous , you know , like millions and millions of dollars . Uh-huh . Yeah . That , that seems to make sense but leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the , uh , kind of the rate for different MUMBLEx . Oh , exactly . Each individual jury really does n't have any perception of what , um , the going , you know , if you will the going , uh , award should be for a certain type of case , you know , within some kind of range . Uh-huh . When you get one way out like that but then really does n't pen , wind up penalizing the person that they went after . Who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us . Right . If they get some of those mega awards against them . You know , they 're not going to sit there and lose money . If they are losing money , then they 're going to raise rates . Right . Th- , they ha , So it all comes filtering down to us all in- , individually . Right . And , uh , granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged , Well , you know . how do you feel about setting , like , well , for example , a car type accident where , uh , or some incident where someone loses a limb . Do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm , a dollar figure for losing different body parts ? I do n't know .
