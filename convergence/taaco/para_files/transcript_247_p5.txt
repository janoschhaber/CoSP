and so that , that got me to sp , to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff , Oh . you know , 'cause normally if , if they need something they just go to mom . Yeah . No matter what it is , I mean , I cou , I 'm perfectly capable of doing it for them , but , Right . it 's so much easier to go to mom , I guess they get used to it . So , but , you know , we 'd go to the library and do things like that , yeah , but . That 's good , that 's good . I know my husband was real , uh , in the beginning when he , uh , he was transferred to a , a larger plant and he , uh , he works about an hour and a half away from here , from our home , Uh-huh . and , uh , so it takes him a little bit of time . Oh , yeah . And I 'm not able to work during the week , uh , because of that . He was , I was working in the evening , Uh-huh . and he was coming home and I , I could go to work , but , uh , Yeah . their relationship , uh , when I was able to work in the evenings , uh , really grew . Uh-huh . He , you know , just the time that they were spending together , Yeah . I think it , it really , it really helped to have that time together . Uh-huh , it really does because I think yu- , you know , you grow closer . Was your , uh , was your husband , I mean naturally a child , I mean ha , had he been around children , or ... Uh , oh yeah , he has , uh , he has seven other brothers and sisters , Oh . and they have , we have thirteen grand , well his parents have thirteen grandchildren . Uh-huh . So it 's , uh , you know , there 's a lot of kids in the family and , and he really enjoys it . Yeah , yeah . But , uh , right now it 's kind of a difficult time , but ... Yeah . And , and the cost of living here is just so tremendously , you know , outrageous . Yeah , yeah . Um , it 's difficult , uh , to do it any other way . Yeah ,
