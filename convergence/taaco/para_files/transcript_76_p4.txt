Oh , yeah , we 've been getting those . Yeah . I went back to school and got my Master 's , and they started sending those things to me again . Yeah , as soon as you 're a graduate student they get your name . Yeah , they did . And , uh , course , I guess , I guess I 've been purged from their records . I used to have an American Express . Uh , back when I had my business I got one . Uh-huh . And they , they goofed up bad on my fir , on my very first bill , because I was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses . Yeah . And the bill would come in , and I 'd pay it . And the very first bill , I paid it , and then I got this nasty letter from them saying , You 're overdue , pay . So I said , Well , it just crossed in the mail . So I did n't do anything about it . Two weeks later I get another letter , even nastier , and said , We 're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you do n't pay . And I looked at that , and I said , Uh-huh . So by this time my checks had come back from the bank . So I made a copy of the check that they had cashed -- Um . -- attached it to their letter , and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces , saying Thanks , but no thanks . Turned out they were n't cheeky . Yeah , they were , I tell you . They do n't talk about they 're charging that enormous fee every year . So what is it now ? It 's up to fifty-five on the gold card . It 's eighty-five for the Optima .
