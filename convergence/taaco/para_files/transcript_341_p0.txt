I chose that topic because I really like gardening -- Uh-huh . -- as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard . Uh-huh . I , well , it 's , it 's , it 's very str , strange that I got this call because my wife just called me . I was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn -- Oh . -- and , you know , mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden , this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall , fall bulbs . Uh-huh .
