Oh , that 's right . I work for a law firm MUMBLEx . I , I 'm serious . And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems tha , that exist in the s- , in the criminal system today . With plea bargaining . Right . You know , if someone is ill , Well plea bar- , plea bargaining is a different story . Well . Plea bargaining is something completely different . That , that actually prevents trials . Or at least speeds them up . Well , I know . That 's MUMBLEx what I 'm saying . But I think a lot of , all of the whole criminal system is messed up in , in that regard . I mean , you know , people who commit , uh , crimes that they , I do n't know how it works exactly but -- Right . -- you know , they get lesser sentences and I understand that the jails are full of people , you know , uh -- Right . -- and that they have to do something .
