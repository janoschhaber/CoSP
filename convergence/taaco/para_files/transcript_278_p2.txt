Because I really do n't like to exercise , I think that 's the basic point of it , is I 'm not , I , I do n't enjoy it -- Right . -- if I know that it 's exercise , but if it 's like a social activity or a recreational activity , I do n't mind -- Right . -- so I have to disguise it , it 's like feeding little babies food and telling them it 's something else so that they 'll eat it . That 's right . That 's kind of the same thing for me . I have to not know that it 's exercise so I can do it . Right . So you look at it more as a task . Well , yeah , if it 's exercise , it 's a task . Right . I do n't want to do anything I have to do . I see . I mean , I 'll voluntarily clean the bathroom , but I wo n't do it if I have to do it . Right , right . So , I 'm thirty-two years old -- Uh-huh . -- which is probably different than yourself -- Right , I 'm twenty-two . -- and so , it 's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise . Right . My job at Texas Instruments , I have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls , so , that , I do n't get any exercise doing that -- Right . -- and plus there 's a build up of stress -- Uh-huh . -- so I need to go out and take those walks after dinner , and I need to go out in the morning and run or I 'll just get nuts -- Right . -- so that 's kind of a motivator , so even though I can look at it as a task , the , you know , I kind of get the , I get some kind of global benefit --
