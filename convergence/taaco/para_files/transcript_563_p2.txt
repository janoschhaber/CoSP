But , does your sister live in a big community ? Uh , yeah she lives , it 's a , it 's a fairly large community . She , uh , got real lucky , though . He had a boss who , uh , moved into a larger office -- Uh-huh . -- and she 's able to take her baby to work with her . Oh , really ? And it 's a small office that she works in -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , it 's a , it 's a legal firm , office , and it 's just one lawyer -- Um . -- and so she 's the only one really that takes care of the office . There 's no one else that works there . Uh-huh . And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby , so it works out pretty good for her . Wow . How lucky . I , I know a lot of people around here sometimes have , like , mothers or grandmothers -- Yeah . -- that take care of their kids and , but , the community I 'm in is not a real large one , so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that , you know , you either know them or know somebody who knows them , to get to , Yeah , so it 's fairly safe . Yeah , to get references and that , so , but , uh , I , I d- , do n't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center , but , simply because there 's so many kids and so many , Worried that they 're not going to get enough attention ? Yeah , and , uh , you know , colds and things like that get -- Yeah . -- spread real easy and things , but , and they 're expensive and , course , there 's a lot of different types of day care available , too , you know , where they teach them academic things . Yes . Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that , but , take a long time to find the right place Yeah ,
