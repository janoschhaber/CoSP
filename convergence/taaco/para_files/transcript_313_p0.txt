The AIDS issue is , is a bit of a problem . I guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem , is , is the financial end . And how can a country stand to , uh , spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem , uh , but , then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the , the knowledge , or at least the , the rumor , I 'm not really sure if it 's true or not , that , uh , we 're not spending as much per , let 's say , afflicted person on cancer . Uh , there 's some , uh , take breast cancer , for instance . It seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more pe- , many more people than AIDS . And yet , uh , more people die of it , and yet the funding has already , uh , exceeded , AIDS has more money than , uh , breast cancer . Than , well , that 's interesting , is n't it , yeah . So , uh , I mean , if it 's true . I , I 've , I 've always heard these things . I 've never bothered to dig it out and make sure , but , uh , I 've heard it on more than one documentary that , uh , they were complaining that whoever 's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and , uh , it 's just one big P R campaign that , yeah , we think that 's the world 's worst thing so let 's give money to AIDS . And yet we 've had breast cancer problems for years . Right .
