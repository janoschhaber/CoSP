Well , uh , I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in , in specific , uh , very specific in this , uh , very specific examples such as , uh , transportation workers , as in , uh , air traffic controllers , bus drivers and that kind of thing . Well . Um , I do n't really think that it 's , uh , too many , I think it 's a severe invasion of somebody 's privacy to say , well , we 're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you 're , uh , you know , worthy of working for us . I really do n't see that that 's a very , very valid , uh , thing for a company to say , and I , personally , I do n't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what 's inside my body . Yeah , uh , I guess I basically agree that , uh , do you think it 's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they 'll take drugs ? I mean suppose they found out some other way ? Well , I think , I think we , I think the problem here is , is that a , a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs . Yeah . There 's too many cases where it can , you know , there can be false positive results , and that , that sort of thing . I do n't think there 's any definitive , you know , okay this person is taking drugs , so we do n't want him here . Yeah . Uh , like I said , some industries , though , I think it 'd be very necessary , I would n't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I 'm flying in an airplane . Yeah . But , uh , I , I just , I find it to be pretty offensive that , that it 's such a , a big deal . I mean , if your employer 's not going to trust you or , you know , it , I just , I think it 's a whole trust issue . I just ca n't see it . But , have you ever been in a situation where you , you were drug tested or , Uh , yeah , I have been . Yeah . I . I once too , so . I mean , I was very offended by , by the whole process .
