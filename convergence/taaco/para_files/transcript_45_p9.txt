just on the lower levels is the highest price , and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level , and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line . And then they 're some sections kind of in the corner areas , and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end , the direct end zones . But , um , they have about four or five different prices now , that they 're structuring it with , but obviously yeah , they 're all going up , MUMBLEx more or less is what it 's going to do . So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year . Um , you know , I 'm not sure , I 'm not positive , I did n't , I did n't really think about that . I just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper . But , not that I 'll ever go . I had n't been to a Cowboys game , las , time , last time I went to the Cowboys game was during that , um , N F L strike , or the , when they had the scab team , teams in there , and it was the , uh , Dallas and Washington Redskins game . And I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets , because a lot of those doctors have season tickets , and they , um , if they 're not going to use them they 'll give them to somebody else . So my dad , I went with my dad to a game that one time . But that was n't a real , you know , it was , it was the scab teams , it was kind of , you know , it was kind of different , I guess . And before that it 's been quite a few years . I 've been wanting to go to a game , I just never , never have gotten around to it . So maybe this year MUMBLEx . That 's interesting , I almost lost our electricity here . Oh .
