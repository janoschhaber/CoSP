So , in my spare time , I love to sew . There are n't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing , but I do make all my own clothes and we recently purchased a new home , so I enjoy doing my , uh , toppers for my window applications -- Oh , uh-huh . -- and things like that . But , uh , just when I thought I really enjoyed my hobby , yours sounds great . Well , my sister is the seamstress of the two of us . And , but she does n't china paint so we both have our expertise side . That is excellent . What part of Ohio are you in ? We 're in the sub- , I 'm in the suburb of Cleveland and I 'm about , uh , fifteen miles , probably , from downtown Cleveland , something like that . And Cleveland is located right on Lake Erie and prior to this , we were fifty miles west from here . So we were right on the lake .
