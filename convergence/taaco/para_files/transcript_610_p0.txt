Have you had that experience recently ? Recently , I ca n't really say recently . But I think about , uh , about a year ago , uh , I bought a product from some company down at , uh , in Atlanta , Georgia . I believe it was one of these , uh , one of these , uh , mixers . These , like these juice machines and , uh -- Oh , yeah . -- the , uh , the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine , it looked , you know , perfectly okay but I found that , uh , it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting -- Oh . -- uh , after , even , despite , you know , diligent washing , it , it got rusty after about , uh , three weeks of use . And I do n't think it was my fault because i- , I , you know , I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it but , uh , it was really , uh , it was , I had to send it back after like , you know , the third week because I realized it was like , it was not , something was very , very wrong with the blade . Uh , what about you ? Well , I do n't have so much trouble with products as service . Uh-huh . I do n't feel like that 's as big a problem . I 've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I 've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly . Uh-huh . And I 'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent . Uh-huh . Uh , the one I have now is okay , most of the time . Uh-huh . But that 's it . But that 's , that 's probably the worst . My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that 's guaranteed . Uh , James Avery . I do n't know if you have that up there but it , it 's a very good company . That -- Uh-huh . -- sells sterling silver things and -- Uh-huh . -- uh , she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it , a lot of money into it by now -- Uh-huh . -- and the catch broke and she was sitting in school on a carpet and when she stood up , it caught and broke and we took it back
