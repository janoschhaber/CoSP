why do you think it , uh , sounds , do you think we should adopt it ? No , I do n't like metric system . You do n't ? I , I , I think the country is , is , uh , too ingrained in the inches and , and just the general , uh , background , the history of our country has been inches and I do n't think there 's a big advantage in going to the metric system . Uh-huh . It , it 's going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years and there are going to be people who die because of it because they do n't understand , uh , you know , simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive -- Yeah . -- and you know how far away something is and it 's , it 's not in our national consciousness to do it . We 've always measured things in the English system -- Yeah . -- and , you know , everything , you know , our land is in acres , our people are n't going to understand what -- Right . -- an amount of something is . Yeah , I , I agree with you . I do n't think we should either even though I know there are benefits to the metric system , I do n't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the , the disadvantages that would happen to the people in America -- Yeah . -- and also the , uh , I do n't know it seems almost like there 's this , it 's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we 'll look good to the other nations because I think they , that 's an area that the other nations , especially Europe , look down on us like oh , we 're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system , who have n't really attained it yet . And I feel it 's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us . And it 's like , hey , we 're content with this . No , it 's probably not as accurate , probably , you know , intellectually does n't , it 's not as sound intellectually , but , like you said I mean , come on . I had six years of college and I do n't know the metric system and I do n't care to learn it --
