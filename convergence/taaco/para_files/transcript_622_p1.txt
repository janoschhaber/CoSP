Maybe thirty minutes max . Well that 's plenty though . And well he spends a lot of time with them while I 'm cooking and then I spend time with them while , you know , he 's doing other stuff . And , and , of course , we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend . You know , there 's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it but it 's neat , it 's straight and I can live with it because -- Yeah . -- I do stuff with my kids , you know . Right . Well , you know , with kids you 're not going to have a neat house . Well , I 've accepted that too . And , you know -- That 's true . -- it , it 's tough to find time . It is . E- , espec- , especially with both of them working . Yeah . That 's true . And you just have to set the time and say , okay this is going to be it . Well , that 's true and , and we do a lot of that on the weekends , you know . We try to spend Saturdays together . Right .
