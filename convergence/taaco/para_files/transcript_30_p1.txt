Yeah . And the people in the city were saying , well why should I go do that . Make the government do that , that 's not my job . Right , they 've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they 've been through now , and , uh , they 've been , they 've been under , under the oppression that they 've been under for so long that now they have some freedoms but they do n't know how to act yet . They do n't understand that to make that work , they 've got to take some responsibility for themselves . It 's not just the government 's responsibility anymore . You ca n't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well . Absolutely , and , and I think that they 're having a hard time with the concept of you can not go back . People only go forward and I think that that is giving them , I 'm expecting a call and unfortunately , I think it 's come through . I 've enjoyed talking to you . Okay . Thank you , bye , All right , bye-bye .
