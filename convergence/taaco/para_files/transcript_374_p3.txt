and I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish , but actually catching fish to eat per se , you do n't really do much of that right there . I catch a lot of little old , uh , I think they call them perch -- Right . -- and then the , the , uh , turtles try to eat up all my bait . Oh . So it 's , it 's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit -- We do n't have , -- but it 's kind of fun .
