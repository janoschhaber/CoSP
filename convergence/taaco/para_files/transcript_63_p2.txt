-- Dede was in there . Yeah -- Yeah , I agree . -- and , um , so , uh , uh , and then the blond that they took out , the one that got killed -- Yeah , I ca n't remember what her name is , but is , -- yeah , I did n't enjoy her . I , I , she was too much of a opposite of Dede , and I think that 's what they try to do , but I think we wanted to see Dede there -- Uh-huh . -- or somebody like her . Well , but , see I read an article about , in T V GUIDE about , uh , about HUNTER , and about his , you know , latest , you know , his three girls , whatever you want to call them -- Uh-huh . -- and they say that , uh , that there was abso- , that there was like a conflict between her and him , uh , that they never really could get her into , uh , any character that they could use . I mean , you know , uh -- The second lady ? -- yeah , the second one -- Uh-huh . -- the blond -- Yeah , -- you know , if you think about it , they did n't really interact hardly at all -- They did n't . -- I mean , they were never partners . Yeah , she would go her way , and -- Yeah . -- he would do his , and I think that 's what I did n't like . And , and , and even , even at the beginning Dede and , and Hunter would decide that one of them would go do this , while the other one would do , would go this , but , uh , it seemed like it was almost two different organizations -- Uh-huh . -- you know , like Hunter was the boss , and this other girl was not , and , you know , you kind of , you 're wondering , you know , well when did this happen ? Right . So , yeah , I , I kind of agree with that . And I like the new lady better , but I 'd just as soon that they did n't have the romance there . I 'd just as soon have the , the police story without all the romance . Well , I 'm afraid that 's what they , they really wanted to do , um , Yeah , I think most shows were doing that , and then they went away from it -- Uh-huh .
