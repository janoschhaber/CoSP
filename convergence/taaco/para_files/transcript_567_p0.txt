Steve , uh , with the election year and whatnot coming up , do you think we ought to cut taxes , raise them , or , or , or what do you think ? Well , that 's , that 's a really hard question . I do know that , uh , politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths . Uh , I let 's example , uh , our friend , the President , right now , says no new taxes , we should and especially , if anything , be cutting taxes now because of the recession and at the same time , the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases , so , uh , I know the politicians , uh , are n't , are n't straightforward . Now , i- , in terms of economics I 'm not , it 's hard , hard to call . It really is . Uh-huh . See , I never thought really , it 's , uh , I never really thought that , that the , the question really had to do whether or not we 're paying too much or too little . I , I always that the , the real question was is , are we getting a reasonable return on , on investment . For instance , like Social Security tax or Soc- , uh , I mean , that 's , that 's tax we 're paying money and , and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire , the money will be there for us . Right . So that 's , yeah , you know , when I , when I see that money taken out of my paycheck each , each week , I , or each , every other week , I , I really think that money 's history and -- Yes , uh , -- you know , so as far as return investment , that 's not , that 's nothing and we 're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back . Uh , someone was telling me that there is a , uh , uh , there 's still an office in , uh , you know , staffed with , with people there and , in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio , which , I may be wrong ,
