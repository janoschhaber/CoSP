Okay . Okay , where have you all been on vacation recently ? Recently , my most recent trip was last year , and that was Detroit . Detroit ? Yeah . Is that a nice vacation spot ? Well , it was n't really . It was , um , uh , to see an old relative . Right , okay . And it was , uh , just to , uh , have some fellowship with her . Right . So you probably would n't recommend that as a big tourist spot ?
