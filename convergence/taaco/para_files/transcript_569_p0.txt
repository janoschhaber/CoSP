Atlanta is kind of high . Uh , it 's , it 's lower than it has been in the past . Uh , I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off , and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher . Yeah , I , that 's probably not true only for Atlanta , but for just about anywhere . Yeah . Uh , what kind of crime problem do you usually run into ? Any specifics ?
