It 's huge . Is it really ? Australia . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Uh , but , Did you have shrimp ? I 've seen in , you know , they , they show all this wonderful seafood and , and great big prawns , you know the big shrimp and , I do n't remember if I had shrimp . No ? Did n't have shrimp there huh ? I do n't think so . I remember food . Oh , I like that too . But , uh , in fact I did n't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car , it would have been , I think , much more fun to do it like in the van , Uh-huh . with a bunch of people . Uh-huh . But , uh , Oh you 're adventurous . You went by yourself . Uh-huh . Really . And I was by myself in China too . Really ? Yeah . Oh wow . China was a little bit more , uh , of a challenge . But , it , it was n't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time , Uh-huh . and so I never , you know , got out by myself , or not much , Uh-huh . Was it very expensive ? No , actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit , no maybe it was about a thousand dollars , maybe a little bit less , I do n't really remember , for ten days including all my meals , a guide , a car , the airfare and , You 're kidding !
