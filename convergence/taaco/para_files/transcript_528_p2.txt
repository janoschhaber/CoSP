Yes . -- really able to . They really are . They do n't like to keep them -- So -- -- longer than a week . -- so there is some good to it . Yeah . Uh , sometimes too , it 's used as a dumb job . You know the fam- , -- What do you mean ? -- well the families do not necessarily , uh , know what to do with them and they do n't want to take the responsibility so they will put them in a nursing home . Yeah , that 's true . So you see , uh , there 's both sides to it too . What do you think ? Yeah and it depends on how , how sick the person is too . What you 're capable of , like if you have a family to take care of , you know , of your own . Yeah . Yeah , uh , I would personally like it if my parents were to get ill , I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help . That 's not always possible . That 's true . But , uh , to the best of my ability , I 'd like to do it until it gets impossible . I think that 's also where you 're going to have a lot of people who are going to , it 's there 's not a choice , it 's -- Right . -- because , it 's not economically feasible even to -- Uh-huh . -- put them in a nursing home . Yeah . So that , that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the , uh , either Medicare or insurance to cover it . That 's true . Yeah . So , But I think nursing homes can be good . It just depends on what kind they are . You know , you need to check them out ahead of time . Yeah , and then there 's also some that are set up for specialties -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I know some . Unfortunately , some elderly have to go to or have , I guess it 's Alzheimer 's or where -- Uh-huh . -- they wonder or , or , uh , confused or have some mental problem . Yeah ,
