Well , I , uh , I guess because I work quite a bit with lawyers , I 'm not a lawyer , uh , that I find a lot of things are so specialized that I 'm not sure , and I , I look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of , of the value of , and worth , so that they have real problems when it comes to , uh , uh , they can find guilt or innocence -- Right . -- uh , but then when you quantify things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate , uh , that they might leave it to somebody else who , uh , has expertise in that .
