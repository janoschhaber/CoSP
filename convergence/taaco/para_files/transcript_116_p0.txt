MUMBLEx return anything . Well , really , the only things that I have returned have not been faulty , it 's been because of the size or -- Right . -- some problem like that . I really have n't had to return things because they did n't perform the way they were supposed to . Most the time they have a pretty good guarantee , yeah . The only thing I 've had lately is , uh , my kids got all these Barbie kind of toys for , uh , Christmas and , uh , i- , it takes them less than a day and they 're broken in one way or another . But I do n't know if that 's just kids , or if that 's , uh , maybe those type of products sh , should be for older kids . Uh-huh . What age are your children ? I have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them . Uh-huh . And , uh , I do n't think they 're unduly rough , but maybe they are . I do n't know . But , uh , a lot of the little Barbie sets they come with real little pieces and they 're easily lost and easily broken but , Uh-huh . MUMBLEx . Well , my daughter is twenty-one now , so it 's been a while since we 've had Barbie things . It 's been a while since they 've , uh , gone through the Barbie stuff MUMBLEx . But we did have Barbies , we did have Barbies and things , and there seems to me that that became a craze when she was already , oh , like , you know , third , fourth , fifth grade . Right . So she was n't in it for very long before she was out of it , but , uh , I do n't remember her breaking a lot of stuff . Do n't remember her breaking , uh , No , I do n't . But I also do n't remember lots of little pieces They 've got so many different things with it now . Well , that 's one thing they 've got . They 've got every type of imaginable , camping on the beach , and all of these come with , oh , like tiny , tiny little plates and little sunglasses . And , uh -- Goodness . -- my three and a half year old has wanted this Ken doll , and so I finally got her a Ken doll ,
