But I heard on the radio this morning , or yesterday morning , that , uh , Aikman 's back in practicing , doing real , real well . Um , who is it , Michael Irvin -- Uh-huh . -- MUMBLEx he said that , uh , Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time . So , sounds like he 's going to be all right for next season . They 're just trying not to overwork him right now , until he gets his shoulder , uh , back in shap- , it was his shoulder , was n't it , that he had the problems with ? I do n't know . Yeah I think it was . I think it , I think it was his shoulder he had surgery on . But anyway , they 're trying to keep him , you know , keep him , uh , from reinjuring anything , but anyway . But , uh , well I got my thirty day notice yesterday . Thirty day notice for what ? Um , I 'm done , where I work . Oh , really . So , anyway , I guess we ca n't talk much more about that , but I just thought I 'd throw that in there . What . Oh , okay , maybe I 'll call you back after , after the recording is finished . Actually I think we have talked about football for five minutes . I ca n't remember . Oh , w- , I 've always ran out of time ever since I 've done this . Really . I usually have , too . They always say you 've talked your ten minute limit . Yeah , I 've done that once or twice .
