No . Yeah , I 'll have to agree , You know . with you there , but there 's another problem , and that 's the , how litigious our society is . If the doctor makes a mistake , he can be sure that he 's going to be hauled into court . Well , I think that should be , that , that 's a , another problem , but that 's part of our legalese problem . And that , the government eventually will address too just , you know , because it 's out of control . I , I agree with you . You know , uh , I was on a jury or I , I did n't make the jury , but there was a , deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant . Uh-huh . Like it was three days after it was born , and he was the one that delivered it . And they got four attorneys , one guy out of Houston , he introduced himself as snake so-and-so , and he says , well , anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars , and I says , yeah , I got problems with . I mean , you know , five million bucks is n't going to bring this kid back , you know , I mean , as sorrowful as it is . Uh , you know , if the doctor is wrong , you know , he should be pulled from his license ,
