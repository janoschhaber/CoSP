-- movie , uh , which I did n't like after all . Yeah , now I ha , I have n't seen THE TERMINATOR movie , but , and that 's kind of blood and guts , is n't it . I do n't particularly care for that sort of stuff . Well , I do n't either . It , on all the , the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he does n't kill anybody in the movie . He does n't . He maims them . Yeah , right . So , Yeah , he maims them pretty good , does n't he ? Uh-huh . He , he , uh , I think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part . Yeah . In the movie . Uh-huh . So . I , I saw , uh , SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY . Uh , Oh , I have n't seen that one yet . Uh , I saw it , uh , oh , couple weeks ago I rented it and , uh , watched it and I was , I was pretty disappointed in it because I , I was told by several people that it 's pretty scary and intense -- Uh-huh . -- and I was pretty disappointed in it . Oh . Now it 's a good movie , but , I guess that they built me up too much . Yeah , well , For my expectations in it there . With all the commercials -- Uh-huh .
