Well , you have got to get one of those ladders . We have one of those ladders . We are just not willing to get up that high . Oh , yeah . A friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood , he has done his house and that is what he , I was out there last week and he has finished everything except the chimney . Well , we did too . We did it in the fall and it , it 's just too high . It is really scary , but -- Yeah . -- and the only thing I would consider doing , a professional , maybe doing that , but it other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional . Well , our house in New Mexico , it was stucco , but we had all this trim to paint , and lots of it .
