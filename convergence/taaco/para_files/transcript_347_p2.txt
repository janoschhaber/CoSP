It 's easy to get attached to them too . Yeah . How old a group , how old are the children go with this center where you work ? Um , in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months . Uh-huh . And throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve . Uh-huh . So , I have the real , real young ones in my room . You 've got the little bitty ones . Uh-huh .
