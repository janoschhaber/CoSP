Uh , of course we 're not , we ca n't consider getting a brand new Cadillac , because those are twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars . Yeah . But when they 're three years old they 're , the price already drops in half . Uh-huh . So then it becomes , uh , more realistic . Right . That 's what I 'm thinking about on my next car is do I want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new -- Uh-huh . -- or do I look for a used car that 's maybe two , three years old that -- Yeah . -- but that 's , you know , low mileage and in good shape . But I just , I kind of worry about getting a car that 's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it . Is it a lemon , or , That 's right . or is something wrong with it but -- That 's right . -- I guess that 's a risk you have to take . Well , you can reduce that risk by , uh , having the car checked out , I mean , you know , if you 're going to look at fifty different cars you do n't want to do this -- Uh-huh . -- but if you 've narrowed it down to one or two -- Uh-huh . -- you can have the car , uh , uh , checked at , uh , an independent service station -- Uh-huh . -- and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong , because they do n't have any financial interest in it . Right . And then you 'll have a realistic assessment of what you 're getting . Uh-huh . About how much do they charge to do something like that , do you know ? Oh , I 'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars . Yeah , that 's not bad . No , huh-uh . It 'd be well worth it if you 're considering buying a car . I would , I would think so . to find out . I would think so . Yeah , yeah .
