That 's great . I 'm going to be able to make my own clothes . I wanted to take a sewing class at school but I just have n't fit it into my schedule yet , but that , I mean , that can really benefit . Right . Um , that 's something that I 'd be very interested in , very interested in learning . Right , because clothes are s- , are really expensive . Uh , they 're outrageous ! You know , uh , uh , a little simple shell , shell blouse , you know , that you can make for about , say ten dollars at , you know , at , at the most out of a decent fabric , Uh-huh . boy , runs you like twenty something dollars in the store . Yeah it 's , Just a little shell to go under a suit , you know . it 's marked up . It is , it is really outrageous but , uh , I mean like whenever I , I was growing up and all , my mom , I never understood this then , but I do now , but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars , or , Uh-huh . um , or she would n't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that and she always told me it was because I was still growing and she was n't going to buy me something I was going to grow out of next week . Right , especially to pay that kind of money for it .
