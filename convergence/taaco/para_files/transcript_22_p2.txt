and if they 're Republican they vo , vote Republican every year , you know , and , uh , the people that are independent , you know , are the ones that do n't , uh , do n't really , uh , show up every year because they ca n't seem to , to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate . Right , yeah , Yeah . that 's good . Ye- , I always thought it was back when Anderson was running , I was hoping that things would change and he 'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes , but , um , Yeah . that did n't work . Yeah , there 's , uh , a lot of extremes on the parties , too , with the you know , the real , uh , far side of the Democrats they 're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago , um , the Democrat party being liberal like they are now , you know , would never be thought of , it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like , uh , moral standings and those kinds of things . Uh-huh . But , Yeah , yeah , that 's , uh , and then , and then people always get upset about it , too , because , you know , every year the , the , the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote , Uh-huh . they , they each think that , uh , if more people vote , they 'll get more votes , huh ? Yeah . I 'm always amazed at that , that each candidate thinks it 's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him , you know . Yeah . That 's , that 's true . I think in , uh , the Texas governor elections , I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody , this time . Yeah , well , that , uh , MUMBLEx I know that there 's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a pr- , pr- , predominately Catholic type area , Oh , really ?
