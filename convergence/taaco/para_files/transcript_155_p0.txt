Okay . All set . Do you want to start ? I can go ahead and start , Sure , go ahead . uh , in Dallas there 's definitely a crime problem , I know it 's , you know , worse in the larger cities . Um , it 's kind of a concern for me , in fact , at the moment I 'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment and , uh , it 's , I am single and female , you definitely are going to worry about the location , and , uh , you know , accessibility of people to be able to break in . I live on a third floor now , but , I , you know , I 'm real concerned that I , I do n't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that , and , the , um , Do they have many buildings that have security there ? Some buildings do , it depends on the location . The area I live in right now , is , is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we do n't have anything at all , no burglar alarms , no guards . Yeah , yeah , well I , I went to Dallas , uh , when I worked for T I in Abilene and , uh , I 'm a little familiar with the city area , Forest Lane and , you know , through that , off , off the freeway . Uh-huh . And , uh , it did n't seem like it was that congested in that , that part . You know because to me where we live out here in the north east , it , it 's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other , Uh-huh . and the cities are very populated with tenement housing , Uh-huh . where there are more than one family in a house . Um . And with the , uh , people that are coming into the country from other countries , not knowing the language and , uh , they- , they 're going to the big cities . It makes it very difficult . Uh-huh . It really does , and , and I 've seen the same thing that you 're talking about , uh , much more crime than ever before .
