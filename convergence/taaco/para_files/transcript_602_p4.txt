I mean I do n't have expensive tastes . I do n't go out . I mean I buy a car , well the last car I got rid of I 'd had , it was nineteen years old . Yeah . Pe- , people were embarrassed for me . I mean it was , it was a good car and , But it was still running . Oh , it was great . My , my mechanics loved it because it was an old , it was a sixty-five Buick and it just would n't stop . Uh , and it , I , I just did n't feel the need for a new car . It is n't like I could n't afford one . Uh-huh . Uh , and now , I mean I , I do n't , uh , I tend to eat expensive food . I mean I do n't mind buying a good steak but for me , I only do that every week or , without even , I mean , maybe once a month . Yeah . I mean you buy a , a tenderloin steak , it costs outrageous , like twelve dollars a pound . You buy a , a , less than half a pound so it 's six or seven dollars . To me , I realize if you have eight kids you 're not going to run out and do that . Not very often . But , but I 'm just , I 'm just saying as a single person , that 's , that 's a drop in the bucket . And so if you 're extravagant on how you buy food , it does n't add up . If you 're buying , I mean if you 're not going to super expensive restaurants , which I do n't care to go to . That 's right . So , so that 's , I think , one of the reasons I do n't need to budget is that I do n't have , I do n't , I do n't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I ca n't afford it , because I 'm not interested in that expensive thing . A lot of ,
