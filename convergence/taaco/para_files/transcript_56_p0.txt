Yeah , uh , yeah , just kind of , it 's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to , to , uh , shall we say bypass the formal procurement process . And , uh , it , it works just fine . It says it 's a monochrome monitor , Panasonic printer , uh , no big deal , it , it does the things I need for it to do . Is it a two eighty-six or three eighty-six base machine ? No , it 's not even that . It 's eighty eighty-eight ? Uh , I think that 's about where it is . Okay . Uh , what type of , uh , utilizations do you make of it ? Word processing obviously . Uh , yeah , I do that , I , I do , uh , some Lotus on it . Uh , do some , uh , Samna , some , uh , P F M , uh , nothing extremely complex . Okay . Uh , I use them both here at work and at home .
