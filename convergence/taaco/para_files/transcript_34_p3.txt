Uh-huh . Yeah , well we have those , uh , which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans . I do n't know if you all have those things around . Yes . And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they 're in almost every shopping center , and you can just stop by . Now everything else like the tra- , uh , paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers but , Uh-huh . but for aluminum that 's real nice and I started doing that at work . Um , I put out a , a trash can and , and for people to put their aluminum cans in , Uh-huh . and that 's really helped a lot , I mean , everybody 's pitched in and , Yeah . you know , it does n't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can . Yeah . So , I really , I really like that , but , people are really concerned , it 's just that sometimes it 's not the right people , Yeah . which is really , really sad because , I wish we would do more . At work we started , uh , all the recycling stuff . They 're really trying , I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year . Yes . And , uh , that really , started a lot of stuff off , but , you know sometimes it dwindles down . Yeah , where I work now we recycle all the computer paper . That 's good . But that 's about the extent of it . Well that 's , uh , at least you 're trying something . Yeah , yeah , It 's just yeah , it would be nice if it could be more . And I 'm sure that the , uh , driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so . Oh do you really . We sell the paper back to the , uh , to a paper manufacturing company . Well that 's a neat idea .
