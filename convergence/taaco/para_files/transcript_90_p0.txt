Uh-huh . Okay movies . I have n't seen too many lately . I have kids and we went and saw THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER , Under , Uh-huh . over the , the break . Do , do you have kids you take to movies or , No , no kids . Yeah . It 's a Walt Disney movie and it did n't get as , you know , as good a reviews as like the LITTLE MERMAID , their last one , and got all kinds of Academy Awards and things last year . But this one was , I thought was excellent . The MUMBLEx , Was that the animated version ? Yeah , it 's animated . And I ca n't believe how good they 're getting with their animation now . It 's just , just the special effects , you know . And in this movie , this , there 's this boy and he rescues this , uh , bald eagle and , uh , and it 's a huge eagle , you know , wing span of twenty feet or something like that . And the boy actually rides on his back and he rides through the clouds , you know , and you see him coming out of the clouds , his head coming out and then the bird coming out , and it , you know , they 're flying all over with it . And I mean , I know they , there must have used , been computers or something for animation this day , but it was just so real , realistic and lifelike and good animation . It was a good show . Even better than ROGER RABBIT insofar as animation ? Well , ROGER was a composite one .
