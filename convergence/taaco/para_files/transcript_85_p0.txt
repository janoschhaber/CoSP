Well , in the norman , in a normal route of way we do things , how about the ladies go first ? All righty . Um , well , I , uh , have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year , so I 'm really just starting to get involved in , uh , in what 's out there and how they do things . Um , as far as the system as a whole , I really do n't see a problem with it . I do see a problem with graduating people that , that ca n't read and are not , you know , productive in society or productive to themselves and , uh , I think that 's the main problem at this point . How about yourself ? All right . I 'm , live in Plano , Texas and , uh , Uh-huh . uh , today we 're not even suppose to be in school because the , uh , the way the taxation and all that crap is , there really legally is n't any funding for the school systems in Texas today .
