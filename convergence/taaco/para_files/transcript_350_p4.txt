Yeah , I , I do n't know . I 'm about sick of mine right now . I do n't , But I think they 're too readily accessible -- Uh-huh . -- and there 's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you dra , get you trapped . I mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it , but that 's a lot of pain and hassle . When , you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and we could n't afford everything , we did n't have such things as credit cards . We just waited until time come around that we could afford it . Right . And you know , we had all the necessities , so . And I very seldom use a credit card on necessities . I always use it for something I want not something I need . Exactly . So , Yeah , my parents are really good about not using credit cards . They are against it . Yeah . I do n't think they like the fact that I have one either . I think if card cards were as , as stringent as say a , a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to , you know , be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills , we probably would n't have the problems we have . Uh-huh . Of course , we would n't have the retail market we have either so I guess they trade one for the other . Yeah . I disagree with it , but they still trade one for the other . Huh . Well , that 's good . I 'm , it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for , you sound pretty young , so . Yeah , I 'm nine- , I 'm twenty right now .
