Hi , my last , uh , auto repair was my , my , uh , alternator went out . I have a nineteen eighty-six Toyota , uh , it 's a little Tercel . Uh-huh . And , uh , I have a fri- , a friend who 's real good with , uh , repairing cars so I got him to take the alternator off and take it and , uh , you know , get a replacement part . Uh-huh . So we went to a , uh , a , a place called Quality Auto Parts an , and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and , and everything and they 're , they 're , uh , very reasonable . So , uh , I bought the alternator , we p , put it on the car and it , it did n't work , and it blew out all the fuses . Oh , no . Yeah . How much was the alternator ? Uh , I bel- , something like sixty-nine dollars , som- , something on that order . Did he , did he hook up the wir- , wiring wrong ? No , he hooked it up right . It , it was just that the , the part just , just did n't fit the car , so . I took it back and , uh , he , he took the alter- , the guy in , in the parts shop took the alternator and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them and , uh , he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator so we , we went back and tried it again , put it on again
