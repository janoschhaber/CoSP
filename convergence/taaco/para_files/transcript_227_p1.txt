And what do you think that problem is ? I think we have a lousy school system . And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we do n't train our teachers very well . And then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents . And then , oh , we do n't , uh , we put too much , uh , responsibility on the teachers , for things that are really not education . They 're social services . Huh . That seems like you 've thought this through quite a bit before . Well , I , as a matter of fact , I just finished editing a book on the topic . So I have some rather strong opinions . That 's interesting . Do you , uh , yourself ... And , and I 'm sure they 're colored by what I 've edited . Do youself have children wi- , who are or have been through the public school system ? Yes , I do . And I was not very happy with the results . I see . So if you were to improve it , what would you do to improve it ? Well , I think I would start with a -bout , with getting rid of about two-thirds of the administrators . Uh-huh . And all the auxiliary personnel . The school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself . Right . And then I would provide , uh , use the money that we 've paying them to , uh , provide some special help in training and particularly , uh , mentor teachers -- Uh-huh .
