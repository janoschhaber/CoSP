snow does n't happen very often . If it does , people go , what 's this stuff . Yeah , uh , originally I 'm from West Virginia . We got a -- Oh , well , you had some there . -- pretty fair amount of snow . Yeah . But , uh , I got down here in June of eighty-four , and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they 'd seen in twenty years , and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane , manly , adult men into playful little children . Oh , I know . We had this group of , uh , surveyors come into , uh , a shop I was working in , uh , four or five of them , these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place . They had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked . But , while they were there they set back , drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles -- Oh , no . -- threw snowballs all over the place , had themselves a ball for about an hour .
