And I have two native Texan children too . Yeah . My husband is always , you know , talked about th- , Texas being a , uh , rebel state . Uh-huh . And , oh , my God , all this Civil War pride . I kept waiting for , where 's some reference to this goddamn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War . Mayb- , is n't much there , was there ? They might as well have not even been there . Right . You know , they were n't a state and the only , the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to , you know , who 's going to be going there .
