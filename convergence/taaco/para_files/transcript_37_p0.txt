Okay , uh , could you tell me what you think contributes most to , uh , air pollution ? Well , it 's hard to say . I mean , while it 's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories , uh , pollute a lot , uh , if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano , uh , it 's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all . What do you think ? Um , well , you talked about , uh , volcanos . I 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now , and , and what the amount of material that they do , uh , put into the atmosphere . I think probably the greatest cause is , uh , vehicles , Uh-huh . especially around cities . Um , uh , do you live right in the city itself ? No , I 'm more out in the suburbs ,
