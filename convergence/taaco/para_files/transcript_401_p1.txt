Well , one , one , one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax -- Uh-huh . -- which in principle is going into , into a big trust fund , but that is a particularly regressive tax , uh , it 's a tax on the first dollar earnings , and Senator Moynihan 's , uh , proposal to , to , to cut there I think wou , makes a lot of sense . I 'm sorry , I could n't . I think Senator Moynihan 's proposal to , to cut the social security tax which is n't really going to , going to beef up , up , up the social security program could make a lot of sense . Right , right . Yeah , I agree with that . As far as other countries , I 'm not , um , I do n't keep up on it too much as to far as what , you know , as what they 're do .
