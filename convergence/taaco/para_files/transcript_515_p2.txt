and , uh , but , they do n't always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and I do n't what happens with all the money because if their plans do n't work , you know , but taxes get raise so . I do n't know . I 'm not really into politics , uh -- That it , -- I do n't really understand it -- Uh-huh . -- but it 's just you know , Well , it does it , it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend . Uh , it 's almost like they will spend as much as the , they 're allowed to collect . You know . Right . Uh , there is an interesting proposal that 's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax . Uh , ten percent or thirteen percent . There would be no figuring . I mean you would take your income tax , you would have a certain amount , I mean you would take you total salary -- Uh-huh . -- those who made under a certain amount would n't owe any taxes , and then there would be a set amount for however many people , you know , dependent you have , and you would just pay a flat tax . No exemptions , no deductions or anything else after you know , after you figure up who 's in your family . Right . Huh . And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with . Yeah . The could be nice .
