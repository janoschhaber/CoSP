Um . I , I have a , a couple . I have a , uh , gas card that I , that I use just for gas and -- Uh-huh . -- you know , uh , one that I use just for emergencies but , Uh-huh , yeah , I h , I have , we have some , some friends that did the , exactly the same thing . They , uh , you know , they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed and finally they realized that they were , they were abusing them and were n't going to get out of the hole and they just cut them all up except for , for one they kept for emergencies and -- Yeah . -- they 're still paying away to get out of debt . I know it . But , no , I did just the opposite . I , I guess I , I sort of followed in my , uh , parents ' footsteps . I have quite a few of them . I -- Uh-huh . -- use them continually , but I , uh , I basically never charge anything I do n't have the money in the bank to pay for . And , uh , and I always pay them off totally every month . Oh , is that right ? Yeah . That 's a , that 's a good policy . Yeah , and it , you know , I mean , they , they 're just a convenience for me . I do n't have to get cash out of the bank , and I do n't have to to be writing checks and -- Yeah . -- and , uh , Yeah , uh , sometimes I wish I had them , but in most cases , I 'm glad I do n't -- Uh-huh . -- because I , you know , unfortunately I , I , I do n't have the control you have . I wish I did , but -- Yeah .
