I had to change the water pump in that , here about a year ago . And it was really fairly easy . Take the grill out and the radiator out and you can just stand there and work on it . Yeah , the hardest part about , uh , water pump changes is getting all the junk off , before you can get too it . Well that 's true . You 're right , you know , by the time you 've finally got down to it , I was hoping I could remember where all those other things went . Well that 's kind of the way I was , I tried to remember as I took stuff off where it went , and I do n't think I had too many nuts and bolts left over when I got it all put back together . A few years ago I had an Oldsmobile diesel and , uh , the , uh , it , after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it . And , uh , I bought it when we were living in Lubbock , when I came back here , I brought the car back here and , uh , I do n't know , diesels got pretty unpopular and you could n't sell the thi- , I mean , though for what you could get for one , you might as well drive it over a cliff . And , uh , the injector pump went bad so I found a outfit down here to rebuild it .
