And they come down here and they 'll sit in the nurseries here and they 'll go ahead and , and , uh , leaf out . So what I 'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that 's , or trees that are already leafed out . Oh , that 's good . I guess they , they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall , all . Yeah . Mostly , I think in a place where it 's really cold they do it in the fall , let them winter -- Yeah .
