Okay Karen . You- , you 're first . Okay . I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement . You know , not to get in , like in a dead end job . Uh-huh . And plus , for me , it 's , uh , I mean like medical and you know , uh , benefits and dental . Okay . They 're also important . Yeah . I guess one of the differences I see is , uh , working for a university , uh , there is room for advancement , but not so much so , our in , uh , quite a highly unionized environment -- Um . -- and then also in the administrative association so there is a progressive path , but not being in the say the commercial sector , the motivation is n't there for a lot of people -- Um . -- uh , like really , Are they like pretty much train for a specific job and that what I hired for and then I , just very little variation from that . Yeah , somewhat that , but then also there just is n't the ability to in one sense have , uh , a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances . Uh-huh . Uh , so that 's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution , uh , it 's a little more difficult to recognize an individual 's performance -- Uh-huh .
