I just do n't know if we would really use it that much . You know . We really , we deci- , we did n't decide to get one until I started working at home . Uh-huh . Then , you know , then , we thought , well we can use it for , you know , some personal things . We di- , for us it really took , you know , a business application -- Uh-huh . -- to justify the expense of it . Oh , definitely , definitely .

It 's got a nice little word processing software on it , you know , and some budgeting type things and stuff . And I do n't think she 's ever touched it -- Really . -- you know . It just , it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home . You know , she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer you know . So . Right . She could just as easily do those things by hand .
