Yes , I , I really hear that , you know , I think , you know , you 're in Oak Cliff . Uh-huh . But , I 'm in Plano . In west Plano . Yeah . And we live on one of those blocks that it 's a neighborhood watch block . Uh-huh . We all know each other , and the street does n't go anywhere . Right . If you are on the street , you better belong there . That 's right . Because it 's not a through street . That 's right . And , still , I want to get up early in the morning and walk . Uh-huh . Before this knee business . And my husband had a lot of heartburn with that . Yeah . I mean , it looked darker to him , because he , he was in the house with the lights on . Right . When I was out walking , it , was more of a predawn type , pretty , but , huh-huh , he did n't think it looked predawn to him . Yeah . It looked dark . Yeah .
