The question was , um , what , what is your opinion of youth , uh , spending a year or two in , in public service . I think it would be a great idea . I 'm not sure about requiring it , you know , of people , because people are going , you know , feeling resentful . I do n't know , but I think it would be a great idea . Yeah . Seems like there 's so many kids that do n't have any since of , you know , what they want to be or do or , you know , they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time and we , sure , our country , all countries sure need help so , Huh-uh . Would , uh , would you be more in favor of , uh , you know , like a local , uh , my only experience with it , I was in Central America for a while , Huh-uh . and , uh , in San Salvador , in El Salvador , Huh-uh . For instance , everybody had what they called there social year , Oh , really . that they had to put in and basically it was a , uh , repayment for , for , uh , high school education , Huh-uh . and most of them joined the Red Cross and it was done internally . I just , there was very little external . I think possibly what , uh , they 're thinking about here , more external Peace Corps , Yeah . Type things where we 're sending people off shore . Well , I think that would be real interesting for people to do , but , I guess , my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them , you know , to other countries , Huh-uh . and , but , I do n't know . If you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they would n't be able to really , you know , send children to do that . Yeah . I did n't know . I do n't , I do n't know how the Peace Corps works , I , guess I was of age when the Peace Corps came in , Yeah , I was too . and all that . I thought seriously about joining at that time ,
