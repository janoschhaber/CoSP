Okay , um , what baseball team are you familiar with ? Well , I 'm only a little bit familiar with the Red Sox because I lived up in Boston for a while , Really ? and , um , and that 's , Oh , now come on , no Texas Rangers ? after that , if you asked me that I would n't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball . Really ? I guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later but , um , I understand a little bit about the Texas Rangers . I know George Bush threw out the first pitch hitter MUMBLEx bounced off the ground and that , um , yeah , I heard a joke on the radio yesterday that , in regard that he did n't design the patriot missile system , and , uh , the radio 's kind of cruel , I mean , think , the , he , this chain that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground , I mean , goll- , how humiliating for a man to do that , any man . I do n't care if you 're President . Yeah , but at the same time , I do n't know , it 's pretty far to throw that far . I could n't do it . I know but he 's a man come on , men know how to do that , right ? Right ,
