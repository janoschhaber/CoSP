We could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it . I believe that . So , you know , it was prime time , it was , what , seven thirty , eight o'clock on a week night -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- and we have cable , and there was n't anything on any channel , and the stuff that was on the prime , the networks , you know , A B C , N B C , C B S , was , it was just , um , dribble -- Yeah . -- you know , I mean , it was n't even funny -- That 's right . -- it was n't creative , it , it was the worst I 've seen . I mean , I have not watched prime time , week night T V , I guess in a real long time -- Yeah . -- because I was shocked . I know exactly how you feel . You know what I 'm saying . That 's right . I , uh , when I first moved down here , moved into the apartment and got cable , and I guess I sort of , kind of became numb . Uh-huh . Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V , you know . And then all of a sudden , I started paying , paying attention to network T V again , once in a while . Right . Right now we do n't have cable . Right . And it 's surprising how much it 's changed -- Uh-huh . -- the whole moral situation , everything , is just gone one whole complete direction different . And we do n't have any kids yet , but I feel the same way .
