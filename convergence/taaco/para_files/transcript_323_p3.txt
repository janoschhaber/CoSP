And it went over so well that they just extended it . And it 's almost , uh , I do n't know if it 's done by a private company or not . It may be . But , uh , they just go around to each , uh , door and pick it up . Wow , that 's excellent . Yeah . That 's good . Let 's see . Oh , and every year , of course , the phone books -- Yeah . -- um , they tell everybody across the city to , uh , put all their phone books in , uh , the , uh , recycle bins . Oh . Because , you know , phone books are pretty , well , for a bigger city they 're pretty thick . Yeah , they are . And sometimes you might have two or three . Exactly . So , uh , that 's , that 's a big savings right there in itself . Yeah , see ours just goes in the regular trash . Yeah , It just , huh . you know , there 's not a whole lot .

Huh . I was n't totally aware of that . Yeah . So . I mean it , it sounds good to the public but there 's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something . Now , aluminum I do n't know . They may be coming out ahead .
