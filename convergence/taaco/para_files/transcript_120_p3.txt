I use to play soccer a lot in high school , but when I graduated I have n't done much . I do n't have a problem . I know I have to do more aerobics , but I do n't have a problem with weight . I could eat all day and not gain an ounce . Well see , that 's , that 's th- , really good and I think that keeps a lot , some people from exercising . Uh-huh . I mean , I do n't have a problem with weight either , but I think I do n't have a problem because I exercise . You do exercise . You know I mean , people are always saying to me , how do you stay thin and it 's because I exercise -- You do it , -- but I also watch what I eat . Uh-huh . You know , but you 'll come , being twenty-seven , you do n't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet -- Yeah and I -- -- but as you get older you will .
