I mean , I , I think I would n't mind if a teacher spanked my child . But , you know , that 's just my personal opinion , and that 's not going to , I mean , I do n't think that law will ever change . They are never going to let a , a teacher spank a child again . But I do n't think , I mean , some kids do n't get do n't get spanked at home and some kids need to be spanked at home . I mean , do n't you think ? I , m- , m- , most wholeheartedly agree . But I do n't know . I mean , there 's a point of over kill , but somewhere in , you 've got to find an even line . Right , right . Well , there 's so many parents that say , you can deal with a child without spanking them . Which is true , you can . But there are times when a child needs to be spanked . I mean , they do things that they need that . Need that shock effect , where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked . Right .
