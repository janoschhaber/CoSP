-- and , uh , you know , there 's , so there 's only a few that I , that I like to watch routinely . What kind do you like to watch ? Probably my favorite is , um , oh , well , I like shows like GROWING PAINS and , uh , what 's the other one now , they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night , so I do n't get to watch it very much . WONDER YEARS ? WONDER YEARS , yeah , that 's my favorite . Uh , I like both of those real much also . I , I think basically , they pr , same thing , they promote family values . Yeah . WONDER YEARS , I , I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever . I guess I can really relate to it , and , uh , it 's just a real cute show . Uh , I , I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of , uh , I do n't know , honesty or sort of a purity value , I guess . I do , too . I , I do n't like it , uh , lot of the shows that , that I 've liked in the past , like , uh , oh , GOLDEN GIRLS and , some of them tend to get so risque , and when you -- Uh-huh . -- have children -- Yeah , -- uh , watching it , that sometimes really starts to bother me -- Right , right . -- and , uh , that 's one of the reasons , I mean , if you want to go all time favorite show , probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE -- Uh-huh , yeah , my wife really likes that show , -- yeah , which I just , I was , I always felt was wonderful -- Uh-huh .
