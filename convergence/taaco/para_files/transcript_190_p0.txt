Well , I do n't , I mean , I do n't know what you think about the , subject , I 'd , the , I had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the , the sentencing to , uh , to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that . I 've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while I was waiting for them to phone somebody , and I do n't know that that 's not a good idea . That 's not a bad idea I , um , uh , that , you know , they probably , need to change it somehow , uh , the whole system needs changing , we 've just got too many people in there , I agree . and , uh , MUMBLEx , are putting too many , uh , people in jail that probably do n't need to be there and it 's another form of sentencing . Uh-huh . But on that one thing , I , I still think it should be a unanimous decision ,
