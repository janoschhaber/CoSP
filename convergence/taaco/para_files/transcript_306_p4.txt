and after a period of time , I think that accumulates in , uh , trees because they take it up through their roots , as well as it landing on the leaves , on surfaces , like you 've seen what it 's done to buildings even -- Yes . -- where it 's really bad . Yeah . What 's interesting , several years ago , I took a course , uh , on , uh , well , it was actually , it was put on by the power companies and , about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was , and there was n't from various kinds of , of energy . And , uh , at that point in time , one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain and it was kind of pooh-poohed , you know . Oh , you 're making a mountain out of a molehill , kind of thing . And it 's turned out that , that 's been very true , what he was forecasting about the accumulation of , of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage . So , it 's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when I took that course . Now , a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear . Uh , I 'm not afraid of nuclear , having had that course because of how the nuclear that , uh , they use is not bomb quality , and , we 're so strict with all our controls in the United States . The chances of , of an accident are slight , and , it does n't pollute the air at all . It 's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant . Many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants . It 's kind of funny because people are just petrified , at least some are , at the thought of nuclear . Yes . So , I do n't know . In Europe there 's a lot of dependency on nuclear power and they recycle the fuel and then instead of , of , some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they 're afraid it could become , uh , bomb quality .
