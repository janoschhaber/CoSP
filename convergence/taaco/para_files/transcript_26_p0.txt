I guess , um , I 'm going to school while I 'm working at T I , so there 's not a whole a lot of time that I 've got , uh , for hobbies it seems like lately . But one of the things that I do when I 've got some spare time is I do some woodworking . And that , oh , I guess , ranges anywhere from , uh , carpentry work to , um , um , some types of furniture and , um , oh , I do n't know what you would call them , knickknacks , I guess , stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on and I made some , um , candle sconces that you hang on the ... Yeah , I have quite a few of those that my uncle made . There 's something about working with wood that , that I enjoy , that , I do n't know if it 's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood but , As you know , I think it 's more like the mess you make , is n't it ? You do n't have to worry about cleaning it up . Yeah , because it 's , it 's out there . You know I do n't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust , and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that , but then , I get the opportunity to vacuum , so I guess I get some of both . What are some of your things you like to do ? Well , when I have time I do like to sew , um , I had been doing a lot of crocheting . I make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them . Yeah . My mother was real heavy into crafts , and I would help her with whatever she happened to be doing , and then , she would go to these , uh , arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework . Oh , yeah .
