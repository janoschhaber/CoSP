You know , I think personally I 'm for it . There 's several reason why I , I could think of right now why we should n't have it such as drug testing , they say , runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it . Really ?

It 's not like a normal urinalysis -- Uh-huh . -- it 's very expensive to run them . And , uh , I did n't get a raise this year , because , nobody in our company got a raise . Uh-huh . But , yet -- Just lucky to have jobs . -- they spend all the money on drug testing and if they were n't spending all the money on drug testing , people could have got a raise . So , see , there , you know , there 's different , I do n't think that that 's , that , I think that 's more of a personal view of mine -- Uh-huh . -- other than a , a yes , sir , we should have drug testing because there 's really a problem and I know that . But then , I have other views to it . I just , I did n't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period -- Uh-huh . -- and Sam 's and Wal-Mart are , are owned by the same people -- Uh-huh . -- he took one for , for , uh , Wal-Mart -- Uh-huh . -- for job hiring and then Sam 's called him and , and he took another one -- Right .
