I enjoy aerobics , and I do it because I like it , I mean , I like the music and -- Yeah . -- that kind of stuff . I like the music , but I 've been unable to do that , because I hurt my foot about five years ago . I broke my heel . Oh -- -- that makes my foot , how 'd you do that ? In aerobics ? No , no , actually I was up on a ladder , and , uh , fell off . Oh goodness . Leaned the wrong way . Uh-huh . And when I came down I hit with my full weight on my foot , but on concrete . What 'd they do for that ? Did they have to cast it ? Yeah , they had , well they had to go in and do surgery . They put a pin in it . Oh , so the aerobics , the impact , would not be good . Yeah , as I permanently damaged the , the cushion under my heel -- Oh , goodness . -- the normal cushion that you have there . Uh-huh . I ca n't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt . Oh , that makes sense . So , I mean , are you , in terms of other things , like , like , not running , but playing a little bit of tennis , or can you not do stuff like that at all ? Uh , well I have n't tried that .
