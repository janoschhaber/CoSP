But it 's just , you know , leak , leak , leak everywhere . But , uh , you know , I hate to go into a , a repair place because they 'll tell me something is wrong with it and it 's not , you know , and charge me twice as much . The last time I took it into a repair shop , the man told me I needed a master cylinder . So I said okay . And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars and then , uh , about a month later , a man was looking at my car and he asked me , you know , not a man , not a repair man , but just a friend and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on and he looked at and he said that 's not a new master cylinder -- Huh . -- and I did n't even know what one was . And , uh , he showed it to me and it was old , rusty , just awful . It was no more new than nothing . So apparently it was the same one that was on there . Uh , more than likely . Apparently just , uh , re- , re- , uh , probably filled the , the brake fluid up and that was it . That was it , probably . It was ve- , I was so irritated . And that 's happened to me more than once or twice . Jus- , just , just about every time I 've went in somewhere . So what 's the solution to that ? I guess find a reputable service , And , and you ju- , can hardly find one , you know . Huh . The guy that 's doing most of my , my car now , uh , goes to my church
