or French donuts would have been good , but it 's real hard to make them . They do n't really come out like they do in New Orleans , up here , I do n't know why . Oh really . I do n't know if it 's me or the water or the recipe I have but , Humidity or something . um , that 's what I want . That 's what I like to make is just real neat stuff like that but . Uh-huh . Kind of like the Italian , it 's really good , but instead I catered to their diet so I made baked chicken in the crock pot
