Well , one thing that I like about this fabric painting thing is I can just make a T shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then , um , cut out a little pattern from the material , from some material , like flowers or something , and make , um , a design or , you know , a little arrangement or something on the shirt and , you know , fuse it on with Heat and Bond , or whatever and then paint around it . And I usually sew , sew around the flower , whatever first , and then I paint around it so you ca n't see the stitching as much . Does , does that make sense to you ? So . Oh , yes , I think it 's very clever . It 's , uh , funny that you said . For Christmas , my daughter and I received matching sweat shirts -- Oh . -- that a friend had made for us . A beautiful Christmas design , and they were matching and they were lovely , but when I washed them , although I took the precaution of turning them inside out -- Oh , sure . -- I really did n't do anything else . Uh-huh . And truly , everything fell off , or -- Oh , really . -- most of it . So I had , I went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back and I bought the paint and redid most of the edges -- Oh . -- and , and it was salvageable , and I , but it 's , so I 'm familiar with that , but I think you 're very clever to , um , sew around the edges . I think gluing alone , certainly if you wash it any amount of time , it -- Well . -- tends to kind of come loose at the edges . Yeah , someone told me that , that it , that they had done it both ways , and I 've always , after hearing that , I always sewed it on , even , even with the , uh , a loose zigzag even helps .
