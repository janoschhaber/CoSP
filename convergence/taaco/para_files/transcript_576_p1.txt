Uh , I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just , I really did n't want it , but I got it anyway and , uh , it was a Braun and they were real good about taking it back . It was n't a problem at all , so , uh , I was able to get that back pretty easily . Uh-huh . But , uh , I do n't know , I really have n't returned a whole lot lately . Have you ? I have n't had to . It 's , uh , the , every so often , I mean , I , I , I 'm almost pushing it myself . Maybe I 'll buy a shirt from G I Joe 's and it shrinks too much and say , well , I should have known better , I mean , I bought it from G I Joe 's -- Um . -- and it was probably made in China by slaves . Right . But , uh , they , uh , most of the time MUMBLEx pretty careful shopping anyway , I get pretty good stuff . Yeah .

It 's probably -- I was reading , -- a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S . Right , I was reading something in , uh , CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact . They were talking about cars , uh , the car issue just came out . Uh-huh . And about how , yeah , you 'd like to buy an American car maybe but , uh , you know , the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever . Yeah . Uh , like I 've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger and , and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi . Huh . You know , so it 's like , what are you going to do , you know ?
