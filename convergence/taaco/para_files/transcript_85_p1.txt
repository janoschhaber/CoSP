So , uh , I mean , when you , when you take , uh , uh , professionals and put them in situations , they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education , and they ca n't get their finger out of their ear long enough to , to get that major subject in line , something 's wrong . So , I think here in Texas mainly that the , the , they 're not serious , they 're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what , how the level of education should be for children . I have a one year old so I 'm not , I 'm more opinionated about the observations than , than the true facts , but , Uh-huh . it 's just a shame to me that , that the , our firemen , our policemen , and school teachers are the three least paid utilities , um , that have the biggest impact to our well-being .
