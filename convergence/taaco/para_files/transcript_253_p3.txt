We 've lived here about seventeen years , and it 's , uh , we enjoy living here . It 's where we originally started out , and we 've lived up north for a while in Chicago and over in Tennessee . So , wound up back about two hundred miles aware , away from where we started out . Yep . Well , uh , that 's about all I can think to talk about right now . It 's been a pleasure talking with you . Okay .
