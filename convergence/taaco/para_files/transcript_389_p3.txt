I , when I used to golf out there I 'd putt well but I , I would n't , uh , chip well . One of the two , uh , or something would go wrong but I always managed to , to get near par anyway . Well , we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst . Oh . And I went to that . Craig Statler won in a playoff . Uh-huh . But we , uh , this is a big golf area . Yeah . We have a lot of , uh , I 'd say we probably have within fifteen miles , twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course , Pine Hurst and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year . Uh-huh . Do you have , uh , long waits , uh , to get on the course ? Yes , we do as a matter of fact . It , it , uh , it 's only been that way in the last five years . Yeah . But now you , uh , most of the courses have a , uh , two day advance tee time you have to call , Yeah . Okay . I just moved into this small community so I 'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here . I 'm hoping that wo n't be , cou , I , was from the , uh , twin cities area . That 's some cold golf too , is n't it ? Yeah . Are you sure you guys are n't having the bad weather ? We have cold . Yeah . Usually January and the first two weeks of February . Well , I wish that 's all we had . But , uh , last week we were in the seventies . Something is coming through now so it 's like in the low forties right now . Oh .
