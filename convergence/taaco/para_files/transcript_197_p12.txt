I had a Toyota and I loved it . Yeah . My Toyota did , It does the , really well . it did a good job , so , part of it is that we need to develop more of a , of a pride in , in , uh , the kinds of things we do so we make them better . Good . Yeah . And it kind of has to start from the top and , and go clea- , or from the bottom maybe and go clear up . People , Well , I think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship . The people just do n't care about , No . what they 're doing . Yeah . You know , the whole , nobody cares , no , nobody 's , Yeah . really paying , Attitude is , is just get me my dollar so I can go do what I want to do , and , MUMBLEx on , Right , give me my paycheck , so I can go home . what I 'm doing , right . I think that 's too bad . And it 's a shame too because , uh , when you get right down to it most things , there is n't any , if you do a good job , nobody can pay you enough . There is n't , Yeah . any way to get paid enough . But if you do a good job , you feel enough satisfaction , so whatever you 're paid is enough . Yeah , and also I think , well , I do research and so I 'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done . Uh-huh .
