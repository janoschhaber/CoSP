I go to aerobics two days a week , but I also have three kids at home so they keep me pretty busy . That keeps you plenty of exercise MUMBLEx . Yeah , that gives me plenty of exercise , but I enjoy , um , walking outside and bicycling once in a while with the family . Excuse me . That 's fine . And yourself . Well , I , uh , I have , I walked and run ev- , um , almost every morning . I 've sort of stopped here with the weather change ,
