We 're supposed to talk about current events . Right , exactly , uh . Well , I 'm a current event junkie . So I , I watch , I try to watch the news , and I read the newspaper , and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what 's going on in the world . I see . MUMBLEx . Well , what particularly are you interested in ? Well , I just , pretty , uh , little , you know , about everything . And , not -- Uh-huh . -- and then again not everything , but you know , I like to know pretty well what 's happening . Political things do n't interest me a great deal , except I do like to stay informed enough to , feel like I halfway vote intelligently , you know -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , other than that , uh , I just , you know , just the events that happen around the world interest me . Yeah .
