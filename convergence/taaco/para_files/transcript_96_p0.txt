Okay , what do you like to cook ? I like , well I like to cook foods I like to eat . I like to eat Italian food best . Uh-huh . And I find that I , that 's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals , type things and , Uh-huh . they 're kind of convenient . That would be good for a dinner party , that , you know , to cook that because you do n't have to deal with eight different things , Right . coming out at once . Is that what you usually cook when you have a party . Um , I usually have parties that are smaller groups . I do n't have , I 've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such . Uh-huh . And so , um , yeah , I guess I usually do . I like to cook , um , heavy sauces , and , um , Really , that sounds good . noodles and pasta and such . Um , fattening . Yeah , actually . How about you , what do you like to , to cook ? Uh , we , it 's funny that , um , we 're talking about this , we just had a dinner party and we had , um , our senior pastor and his wife came over . Uh-huh . And I catered to their diet is the only thing , though , so it was n't something I really wanted to make . I really wanted to make red beans and rice and with MUMBLEx .
