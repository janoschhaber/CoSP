Uh , my little girl , Jennifer , likes to do crafty things , and I 'll take some time and do that with her . And , of course , we always read a bedtime story at night , and even the , the older kids sometimes sit down and , and will join in and listen to a story . I 'm , Uh-huh . basically the story person because my husband does n't have , he gets home from work late or whatever and , and usually , once in a while he 'll read the story to little one , but that 's basically my job . Yeah . Um , So do you find it difficult to find time , or is it pretty natural ? It is . It is hard -- Uh-huh . -- because , you know , at the end of your day you want time for yourself -- Yeah . -- and , and it , and that 's kind of cutting into your , your time . Yeah . And with the kids getting older , now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten -- Uh-huh . -- which really is late , but , you know , on school nights , the two older ones get to bed about nine . They go upstairs at nine , and , um , now , this weekend we 'll have a baby-sitter come and , uh , my husband and I will go out to dinner and come home and , um , probably not too late . Uh-huh . Maybe Brian will still be up , and spend some time with him . But it , it 's really hard . You have to be a very unselfish person to , to spend a lot of time with your kids , I think . Yeah , yeah . Do you work during the day ? Uh , no , I do n't work . I , last year , um , I had a little part time job in a private , um , high school , tutoring , um , high school students with learning disabilities . Uh-huh . That was two days a week , and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot . I do n't know how , I admire , Yeah . people that , that can do it all , but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way -- Yeah . -- I want it kept , it is hard . I can imagine . Um . Yeah . Even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything .
