Well , what would you have at a dinner party ? Well , uh , lately , since I have children I 've cut down on having dinner parties . Uh-huh . but when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time , uh , I have one recipe for , uh , a really good , um , type of a meatball . It 's called burgundy meatball and it 's made with red wine and , Oh , gosh , um -- that sounds great . -- It 's , it 's really good and you can make it ahead of time and then , um , make the sauce when you 're ready to , um , to serve it . Uh-huh . That 's one of my favorite things to , to serve . Well , um , I think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party . Sure . But if it was informal , my first choice would be crawfish . Oh , really .
