I 'm thirty , so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and , and the Sex Pistols and -- uh . -- R E M , that sort of stuff . Uh , R E M makes me laugh because they 've gone from a college radio progressive group to being , uh , you know , ultra mainstream at this point , and it 's not really that they 've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed . Oh , yeah . Yeah , it 's , a lot of people l- , like , saying that , you know , bands in that position , you know , sold out . Uh-huh . I think that 's pretty much , you know , bull . Because R E M really has n't changed . If , it 's , it 's interesting . They 're producing , uh , similar music and it 's good music -- Uh-huh . -- but , you know , people have picked up on it . That 's good . I think it is . I 'm impressed . Uh , for a while there , music seemed to really ha , popular music seemed to have , uh , not a lot of point to it .
