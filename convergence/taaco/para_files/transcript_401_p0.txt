Yes . Um I guess my initial view is our tax burden has n't gone down in recent years despite , our total tax burden , despite tax cuts -- Uh-huh . -- but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in , in the world , and in MUMBLEx of the matter , you get what you pay for , if we 're going to have national health insurance , which seems likely , it 's necessarily going to involve more taxes . Uh , I suspect , I take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the , the economy , that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes , uh , energy taxes , particularly , and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes , that 's the direction we should look . Right . Well , I guess I kind of have mixed feelings . Um , you know , you always sit there and out of each pay check so much comes out of it , and you wonder , you know , where 's it all going -- Where 's it all going ? -- and we have such a huge , uh , national deficit , and , and I guess a lot of times there 's questions wondering well , if it 's doing a whole lot of good . I know there 's a lot of social programs out there that need help .
