And , so , I think that kind of control is , would be good , Yeah . but the , uh , I , you know , I 'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement and , just to kind of exam it a little bit and I , I know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true , uh , only the guns were in the hands of the criminals , but how many times , I guess I have never heard of a , a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who 's being robbed had a gun . Um , I , And maybe they just do n't report those or I 'm not sure or , you know , I ca n't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed but good thing they had their gun on them and they , they thwarted the robbery attempt . Yeah , I , I 'm , I 'm not really sure , I do n't , personally I do n't own a gun , Uh-huh . um , and I do n't think I probably ever would , um , although I would like to know how to handle one , and I think it 's good that everyb- , and I think everybody should learn how to handle one . Uh-huh . Um , you just never know when you might come into contact with one .
