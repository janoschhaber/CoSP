Wow . I was , it was n't a good week . I was pretty mad . And plus the place that I 'd bought them all had gone out of business , so even if I , I think even if I had , uh , had kept the warranty , the service agreements were with the companies that , that manufactured , but still they were through that retailer , so I do n't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not . Wow , it 's frustrating . But I did n't have to worry about all that , because they were n't under warranty . So . It was a call to the local appliance dealer -- Uh-huh . -- who came out and fixed them all , but , I , the only other things that I 've ever had trouble with , uh , I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers , blow dryers . Uh-huh , they go out a lot ? Yeah , I 've had two or three of those go out . One was under warranty , and the other two were n't , but , I just , other than that , you know , T V -s and things like that , I have n't ever had any trouble with . I do n't think products are getting much better though . Yeah . See I 'm in the manufacturing MUMBLEx home from work and make , um , automotive air bags , the safety air bags . Oh , really ? Yeah . That 's interesting . At Morton International , and , I thin , well , it 's , it 's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment . We test everything after each assembly process , and so our testing is pretty thorough , but . Do you , do you test each individual one -- Um .
