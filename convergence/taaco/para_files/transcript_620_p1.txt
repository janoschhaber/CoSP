Uh-huh . -- and , uh , and putting that guy into , into therapy to , whatever it is to , to , you know , break this , uh , activity . Of course , if he 's fallen in love with drugs and there is n't anything but getting stoned or high is , is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful , then maybe there is no hope . Yeah . What 's your , uh , feeling ? Uh , well I guess I , I guess I 'm probably a little more to , toward the other direction . Uh , well I guess , mainly because , uh , it 's , I , well , like there 's two sides to it I guess . Uh , one is that , uh , if you 're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug , alcohol , whatever , or , you know , even if it 's smoking , inhibits , you know , your ability to function , then I , I think that , that , you know , I do n't have any problem at all with testing that individual , you know , on the spot . Uh , but I guess I feel more like whatever you 're doing in your own private life is your own private business . Uh , and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that , uh , things like drug laws seem to come and go . You know , we had prohibition for awhile and then we did n't have prohibition . Uh , you know , we 've had , I guess , laws against , uh , you know , various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years , I guess . Uh-huh .
