So do you have P C -s ? I have a personal computer at home . It 's an A T compatible . I do n't use it very much any more . I used to use it quite a bit . Uh-huh . I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal . I do some P C stand alone work on it , and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame . Uh-huh . What about you ? Do you own a computer ? Um , well I sort of own a computer . We have two P C -s at home ,
