Okay . Uh , do you live in a home ? Yes . Uh-huh . We , we , it 's a house we bought , uh , about two and a half years ago now . Oh , did you ? Uh-huh . Uh-huh . First house . We 've lived in ours for about six years . We had it built , actually . Uh-huh . And , uh , uh , it 's our first home , too . Uh-huh . Yeah . So what do you think of , of owning a home as opposed to , to renting somebody else 's ? Um , well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that -- Uh-huh . -- we were living in , and , um , that was quite an experience . I , I much prefer having my own home and , and , uh , just the space and , and more privacy . Uh-huh . Yeah .
