Uh-huh . -- certain times when that will be left over . But that 's completely up to me how I do that . And -- Uh-huh . -- then , uh , because I do n't work . I stay home . I do too . I stay home also . And so it 's kind of my money and I also get my own money to do what I want to . Go to lunches , you know , and do that kind of thing . Uh-huh . We have a clothing , uh , envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing . Uh-huh . It really works out great . We 're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that .
