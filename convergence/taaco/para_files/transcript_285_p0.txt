Okay , uh , well do you , uh , keep a family budget or do you have some , No , I do n't use a family budget , my father who is very old has kept one his entire life , Uh-huh . and I probably re , rebelled against it . I probably should have kept one . He keeps every penny that comes in and goes out -- Oh , interesting . -- on a very strict percentage . Yes , well , uh , we sort of started doing it years and years ago and my husband started graduate school , when we were first married , and I sort of just got in the habit , I guess . And , you know , never have gotten out of it . I can not really say that it 's a formal budget , it 's more just a , a pretty , uh , a fairly , uh , accurate , uh , recording of what I spend , Right . and what I think I am going to have to spend . And , uh , I think it makes much more sense , Yeah . and I have recently , uh , gotten out of debt and everything and I will probably ke , start keeping a little better , Yeah . track of it . Yeah . I just , uh , spent whatever came in and , and , uh , didn- , never knew what came in and what went out . Right . But , uh , just , you know , like , about like the government runs . Yeah . Huh . That sounds real similar . So , I think it is probably better to have some sort of a , a , at least a record but my dad was so precise , Um . that , I mean , if it said to spend eleven percent on something that 's what it was spent . And -- Oh , my , yeah . -- that was put over there and , I mean , of course , he is from the depression , and , uh , Yeah . so , uh , you know , it 's his life , Sure . but , uh , I would , I think it would be smart if somebody would keep , uh , some sort of a plan that works for them . Yeah .
