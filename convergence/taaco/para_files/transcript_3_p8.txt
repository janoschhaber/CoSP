If I deviate from social norms of behavior , if I run up and down the street yelling or something , someone 's going to invade my privacy very quickly . Uh-huh . And I realize that that , I mean , I can take that for granted but I used to , I used to live in India and things are quite different there in terms of that . There 's less of a sense of privacy . In fact , it 's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy , certainly the language I know does n't , Oh , that 's interesting . but just says a word for loneliness . Loneliness is the closest you can come , which is really quite different . But , but no concept for wanting to be private . Yeah .
