Other kids are going to be really into math , some are really going to be heavy into reading . Right . Instead of pushing the scales too far either direction , I mean it 's great to be well rounded and hav- , be exposed to all this stuff . Yeah . That 's , But why not hit the points the kid 's really interested in ? Because if he 's interested , he 's going to study it , and he 's going to learn it , and he 's going to remember it . That 's true . The only , I think the only thing that they would argue about that , is that , you know , every child needs to learn every subject . I mean , that 's , that might be the only thing . But , I mean , I , I definitely agree with you . Uh , They need exposure to every subject . They do n't need to be masters of it , Right , right . That 's true . Uh , Everything I learned about ancient Rome ha , has not helped me anywhere in , my adult life . Yes , I definitely agree .
