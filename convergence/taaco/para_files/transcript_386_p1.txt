I , I find it very annoying when I 've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly , the solicitors , and the carpet cleaning companies and , Uh-huh . Does that happen in your part of the country ? Yes . Uh-huh . I , uh , Definitely . I come home and I am trying to get a few things done and I ca n't do anything but answer the telephone . Right . Some evenings are worse than others , but I wish I could put a stop to it , but I do n't know what to do to stop it . Right .
