I mean I 'm getting around real good and I 'm just still real sore . Yeah . And today I was , I , course I went back to work two weeks after , uh -- Oh , gosh . -- but see I do n't have permanent work . I , right now I 'm working with a temporary agency . And so , the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free . Oh . Oh , so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that 's what everybody wants , and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed . Yeah . And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day . And I said , yeah , and I went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that . And , uh , I worked about three days a week ever since , two to three days a week . And so I went to my doctors last Thursday , and this was my fourth week checkup and he said well gosh , you 're just healing really well , I just ca n't get over this . He says , in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things . If you want to play ball , you can go play ball . He says , now I 'm not going to say you 're going to feel like playing ball but you can -- Yeah .
