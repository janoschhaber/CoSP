Okay , well what do you do on your yard ? Well , uh , typical lawn stuff . Saint Augustine , uh -- Uh-huh . -- with a little Bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas -- Uh-huh . -- uh , and really all I do to it is , uh , in fact , I did n't even fertilize it this year , I just mowed it , and I , I mow it , uh , you know , with a mulch mower so the , the particles fall down -- Comes back in the yard -- -- Yeah . -- so you do n't have any one do your yard . You do it yourself ? I do it myself . Yeah , we do too . Have a lot of people trying to do it for me . Is n't that the truth . A flyer 's on every door every day . Hey , I need the exercise , so what the heck . That 's right . Well , we , um , we , my husband does the same thing , he does the yard , and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower , but I keep putting off learning . Hey , you 've got the right idea . That 's right . But I had recently gone out and planted mums . We had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago , and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway 's -- Uh-huh . -- and put out yellow and bronze and they 're just gorgeous , and so then last week my mom comes in town , and she says Well , those are going to die just the first frost . She said , You should have done pansies . And I went , Well , now you tell me . Yeah . So the first night , that around Halloween and we went out and covered them with a sheet , and they did okay that first night . But the second night we were at the movies and did n't do it , so I guess I 've lost them . I have n't gone out to check yet . Yeah , I do n't blame you . I would n't want to look at them . No , listen ,
