Because women are in every field now , I mean I ca n't think of a field that they 're not involved in . Oh , I ca n't either , not a one . And I know at least in the medical field , it seems like they 've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field . Uh-huh . I do n't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing . Yeah , even in Washington , you know , Yeah . there seems to be a lot more women involved . Hopefully , the next generation , it wo n't even be an issue , I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman , Yeah , yeah . I think that would be the best goal . Oh , I do too , just your qualifications and that would be it . Uh-huh , exactly , not what color you are , how old you are , what you 're male or female . That would be wonderful , I guess it 's kind of an ideal world though , huh . Yeah , I kind of think , maybe in time , that , you know , you 'll go by social security numbers , you know , Yeah . and that way they ca n't say well they picked a male over a female , female over a male , you know , Exactly , or the way you look , or the way you , you know , Yeah , yeah . your age or anything . I think that would be a wonderful way to do it . I do to just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that , you know , that you have . Uh-huh , and then , And then if you get it , you know then , Uh-huh , also , with , uh , women in the work force they 've gotten a lot more options as far as , you know , what 's it called , job sharing . Uh-huh .
