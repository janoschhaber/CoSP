-- but , it , it bothers me from the fifties on , not that I 'd remember that much -- Uh-huh . -- from the fifties but , but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality . Yeah , that 's true . That 's true . We worked hard for everything . That 's very true . And so they -- Uh-huh . -- in the , there were the sixty-four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties , but nowadays , there 's so much on TV where , where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing . Of course -- Uh-huh . -- uh , I work for lawyers a lot and I see , unfortunately , we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and , you know , there 's a million dollars you can have -- Uh-huh . -- uh , for mental duress or whatever . Yeah . But , you know , the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the , uh , in Europe , they seem to have mentality , and drunk driving is a good one , is that people are well indoctrinated in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable . Right . And , yeah , if you 're going to drink , and you may drink , you better have your designated driver . Uh-huh .
