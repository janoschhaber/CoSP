and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked and it has eighty-two thousand miles on it -- Uh-huh . -- and we were , kept saying , would n't it be great if we could find another one just like it . Believe it or not , we did , we found one , one newer -- Oh , no , -- the worst part is , it 's the same color -- Uh-huh . -- and so everybody 's saying , you 're kidding , you have two cars the same , and I said , you know how when you have a bad one , you say , never again -- That 's right . -- I said , well , we had one , and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it -- Wow . -- and it 's an eighty-five , and so I said , Hey , this was a cinch , we paid for the car , and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on . Right . This is for all the long running back and forth on , you know interstate driving and things , and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years , or next year probably . Do you , um , buy from dealers or from individuals ? Generally from dealers , and uh , it depends , because I do n't like to sell what we 're trading in to an individual -- Right . -- uh , unless we , we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell -- Right . -- you know , we were going up to a larger one , but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer , and we always make a deal . I mean , we have walked out of more dealerships saying , do n't bring us the manager , and all of that unless you want to bring him right away . You 're going to get one shot at us -- Yeah . -- we will , you know , and they say , Well , you 're kidding , you know . I s- , no , this is the price we 're going to give you out the door . We do n't want to hear about taxes ,
