Okay , why do n't you start so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon . I 'm already on my job -- Oh , you are , -- so , you , you reached me at my job . Oh , wonderful , well how do you dress for work ? My , my dress for work , uh , most of the time is , uh , rather comfortable and casual -- Uh-huh . -- uh , usually , uh , slacks and a soft colored shirt . The , um , thing that , that distinguishes me a lot of the time when I have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is I wear a clerical collar -- Uh-huh . -- and a suit and , uh , all of that sort of thing , but when I do n't need to dress up for a , a meeting or a -- Uh-huh . -- service of some sort , I do n't .
