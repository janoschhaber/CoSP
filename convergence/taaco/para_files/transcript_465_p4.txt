And that 's another thing , I 'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping , um , usually on the weekend , and that 's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son , and they 'll be my helper , and then they 'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out so , Yeah . I try to do things like that , but it , you know , it 's , it 's , uh , Yeah . And then , of course , they have a pretty , um , busy social calendar too . Uh-huh .

People are , Uh-huh . real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids , sports activities and , Oh , that 's good . You know , but , um , Yeah .
