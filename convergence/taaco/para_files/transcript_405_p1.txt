It 's sickening , is n't it ? Um , uh , well , in the Carolinas it 's , it 's just , you know , we 've got a bunch of golf courses around here . Yeah . We 've got tons up here but I do n't know . How do you feel about your game ? I guess that 's a good question ? Uh , well , I mean I 'm not a serious golfer at all , uh , uh , a friend of mine goes golfing a lot and he drags me out every now and then and I , uh , I do n't have a , I do n't really even have a game . I usually when I go out and play golf it 's usually like at a , at one of these par threes that , Yeah . you know , you , but , um , I like watching it on T V . Yeah , I like that too . I do n't know I try to play , but God , I , a couple years ago I played two , three times a week and got lousy . I guess that 's the best I ever got was lousy . And I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come and then I got worse again so . to get me they , they say I hit worm burners because I , I ca n't hit it up in the air . Yeah . So I 'm pretty bad but I , I , I get great distance hitting it , you know , MUMBLEx across the ground , and if it 's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I 'm , but I 'm getting better . I 've got where now I can hit it in , in the air some of the time . That 's pretty good . Yeah . Uh , so I 'm kind of a novice at it . Um , I 'm that and worse . I , I play next year I , actually I take it kind of seriously but I 've been doing so bad . Next year , I always say this every year , but next year I 'm starting over from scratch . I 'm going to go take lessons and everything . I 'm going to do it right , and see if I can actually play this game or not . Well , that I , I guess that 's what I need to do is , is get some kind of lessons or something . Because I , my , my tee off is not bad , I mean I 'm , I 'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that it 's just , that , that initial tee . Yeah ,
