Uh , you know , we 've got two cars . My wife has a car and I like to drive pick up truck . So , we are on a schedule where I try every , uh , three or four years to , to buy a new one . And you know I am constantly making car payments , but I figure that 's got to be the story of my life anyway , is making car payments . Uh-huh . So , uh , you know , I get one paid for and , uh , actually I am saving up for another one besides so -- Huh . -- it 's you know , it 's kind of a never ending thing , but -- Right . -- you try to , you try to schedule those things so that , uh , you only , you 're not paying for two of at the same time -- Right . -- I guess is what I am saying . Have you thought about , uh , leasing ? Well , uh , I have thought about it , but leasing would n't , you know , I do n't use it for my business . I see . My wife uses hers just for pleasure and I use mine just to go back and forth to work -- Right . -- which is only ten miles away so . But if you are rolling it over every three years , it might be advantageous to do that . Yeah , I guess . Uh , You know , typically , you , if you purchase your own car you tend to make , uh , the best returns after you pay it off . Uh-huh . Of course , the longer you keep it beyond that point , the more profitable it is to own it yourself .
