Oh , you do a lot then . Do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching ? Um , I 've done some cross stitching . I have n't tried any needlepoint yet . How about you ? Um , actually I , I 'm pretty untalented . Oh , right . I used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting , um , but I , I do n't know , somehow I do n't have the time anymore . But I have all these friends that wherever you go , they , they sit down and the next thing you know , they pull out of their , uh , bags some , their most recent , uh , needle craft -- Oh , really . -- and in December everyone was doing stockings , you know -- Uh-huh . -- these gorgeous , detailed -- Oh , gosh . -- minute , tiny stitch stockings .

I only can do things that are pretty fast , because we just , um , got our baby last year , and I just do n't have the patience to just , you know , do something . Is this your first baby ? Uh-huh . Have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets ?
