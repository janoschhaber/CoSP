Hi . So , uh , what was the last car repair you had ? Just recently I was kind of laughing when I , when I heard the switchboard talking about the question because , uh , I had to have my , uh , radiator flushed -- Oh . -- and it was getting rusty . And the thing that they forgot to do was to , um , to also look at the hose , and I had gone about oh , two days with my new radiator flushed and the hose burst . So I was stranded out on the highway . Oh , no . Did you crack the block or what ? No , I , I did n't do that thank goodness , but , uh , there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there , you know , left to do that but it cost me all kind of money , you know , to have that repaired after they said they were going to , they had repaired it . So that was , that was a horrible experience -- Yeah , I see . -- just recently . You got lucky you did n't ruin the whole engine though . Yes , yes .
