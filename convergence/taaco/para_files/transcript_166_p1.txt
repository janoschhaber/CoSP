How would they decide who goes into , uh , building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who goes to Saudi Arabia ? Right , yeah . I , the , my first impression was , um , it would be v- , very good . I think it would be good for people to serve , but I do n't know if it should be an option . It would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the Depression or coming out of the Depression available for kids . And I think there are some available now where they are able to work , but making it a mandatory thing kind of , Yeah , the , the difficulty would be in whether it 's voluntary or involuntary . Right . And the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary , that it should be like a draft . Uh-huh . And some people would get military service and some people would get civilian , uh , service , like working in hospitals . This , I assume it 's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do , when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the Army , they were allowed to do hospital service or , uh , things like that , and if they re- , or farm work in World War One I remember -- Uh-huh . -- uh , reading about . And , and I suppose that there is , uh , justification for taking everybody if you take anybody . Uh-huh . But I just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them , uh , sorting them out , assigning them , Uh-huh .
