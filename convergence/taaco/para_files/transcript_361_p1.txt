I , I tend to agree with you . When it comes to government spending , there are so many studies done that do n't mean anything -- Yeah . -- but we 'll spend hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of dollars on . Yeah . And it 's nice to know something does n't work or something does n't exist , but , it could be put to more practical use . Yeah , and I , I think that , uh , it 's a , a tone of our times that politicians , uh , are into themselves more than they are into , you know , doing something worthwhile for the people they represent , which is really unfortunate . That is true . I agree with you in that area . Uh , I have a tendency to , I 'm in , from Texas and I read , you know , how our politicians voted each week in the paper . Yeah . And it 's , you know , it 's interesting how the votes vary and what they ran on in platform -- Uh-huh . -- do n't necessarily come true in their voting in the senate or Congress , whatever . And do n't really respond to , uh , people who write them and call them and , uh , you know , unless they 're in the limelight and under pressure . So , yeah , I think we get short changed on that .
