Okay . Um , if I can find it . Well , I have this new fondue pot and I was going to do basic cheese fondue , and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham and I was going to try something weird which , you know , when you have fish au gratin , I was going to make some , uh , like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue . I do n't know if it will come out .
