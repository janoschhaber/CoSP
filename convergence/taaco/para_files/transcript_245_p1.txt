Okay , I live in Plano , in a four bedroom , two bath house , which is the area 's dominantly three bedroom , two bath . So , I 'm just a little bit different than typical , uh , and of course , the Plano area is basically with alleyways , so everything around here is set up that way . Which I think is a little bit different than most areas , in the houses , the way they 're constructed . And it 's a brick house , with , uh , some wood . It 's real nice , I like it . How about you ? Well I , I certainly hope so . We have a , a classic ranch , up in Denton . Ranch style home , I shou , I would hate to think that anybody thought , uh , the lot we live on as a ranch . Uh , it 's in a subdivision and one story . It started out life as a three bedroom house , and now has no two car garage and has , uh , the two extra rooms enclosed . I suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of enclosing the garage . Are most of the houses in your area three bedroom , two bath ? Almost a hundred percent . I , I ca n't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision . Ours is probably the closest to it . You know how realtors are , they 'll say , oh this could be five bedrooms . Yeah , if you had two people that do n't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house , Yeah , to . do n't need a closet .
