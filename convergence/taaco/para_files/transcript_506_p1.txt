No . -- whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like , you know , they want to get the best , uh , mix for their case , so -- That -- -- they ask all kinds of wild questions . -- that 's a science in itself . Yeah , well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions , and I think part of it was they did n't , uh , they did n't like the fact that I do n't drink any more . So . Uh-huh , I see . Because you 'd probably be , uh , too puritanical and -- Yeah , that was -- -- MUMBLEx . -- probably it , although in my case I might have been more , uh , sympathetic with the person who got caught , I do n't know . Uh-huh . So , uh , were , were the , uh , sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair , or would , if you were deciding , do you think that they would have been different . Well , I was never there , never there for any sentencing . Uh , I finally got empaneled on one case , uh , on my next to the last day , and , uh , we got into the , uh , jury room to , uh , decide the case , and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he did n't need to deliberate , because he 'd already decided that the guy was , uh , not guilty , and he would never vote for guilty . Huh . So , uh , they appointed me jury , jury foreman and I , uh , did n't think that , uh , going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict , so I told the judge that we were n't , were unable to reach a verdict because we could n't get one member of the jury to deliberate . Um . So the whole thing had to be tried over again . Wow , I bet that made him happy .
