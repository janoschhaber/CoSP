So we went to one and he just put a big old cast on it . Put a big cast on it . Yeah , for about four weeks . Four weeks , yeah . Well , I like aerobics , but I 'm not so sure that , Well not that much , though . No , I 've never , I was off for about six months too just for some other surgery I 'd had , but I 've never , I 'd , you know , I was pretty much in shape walking and , and , you know , this is one of those things , like this orthopedist said , he said you 'd be surprised how many basket- , how many people come in here with things like that because they are active . Yeah . You know , I was real embarrassed , but I felt kind of stupid . . Well , those things happen , though . Yeah , they do . I mean , I guess I 'm glad , you know , that , um , nobody really noticed , I guess you could say . Yeah . Because I got up and started jumping on it again . Well that did a lot of good , I 'm sure . Yeah really .
