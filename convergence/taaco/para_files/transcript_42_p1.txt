Uh , now I think the change that I 've seen as much as anything is one where couples , uh , are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will , uh , have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place . Uh-huh . And I guess that 's a significant change that I 've both participated in an- , and noticed . I agree , uh , the equality of , uh , the roles now between the sexes , I guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war , especially compared with , uh , the Vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men . Uh-huh . Uh , I have wondered why they allowed , or let , you know , both the father and mother go , uh , and the children are left without either parent . Now to me that 's kind of a drawback . But , uh , I guess it 's a price you pay . And I also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the , uh , uh , day care centers . Wonder about them in what way ? Well , uh , from what I understand there 's been studies that , uh , these children are , uh , more rebellious . Uh , they term it as more , uh , creative . Uh-huh . But , uh , that they , uh , are much more contentious . So , I , I do n't , I , I guess we 'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up , you know , in a , uh , kind of a , uh , community , Uh-huh . rather than a home .
