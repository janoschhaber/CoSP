Okay . So Frank , what , uh , type of , uh , budget do you or your family have ? Well , uh I do n't know that we really have a budget . I have a set amount that I , that I save . Actually , well actually there is a , a way , budget our money apparently . The , uh , my wife , uh , has so much , uh , gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and , uh , we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff , gas , and things like that and besides that I , uh , you know , I have a set amount that I save every month . Right . That 's , uh , sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have . Uh-huh . I am single , so . Uh-huh . I guess , I do n't know if that 's an excuse for not having a tight budget , but I basically , Really do n't need to . Right , I do n't need to . I am the only that I have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier . That 's right . Uh , and also I , you know , I try to save a certain amount each month as well -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , I try to , try to have an idea of what my expenses are and I am pretty consistent from month to month -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , whenever , uh , I need to , uh , whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it . Right . Well , I found that , uh , you know , things , as I have gotten older , I am in my fifties now , but before we use to have , to have to have a very strict budget ,
