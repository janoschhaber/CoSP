do n't say that too loud though because , uh , every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue , Well , it just means if you do n't pollute , right , or you pollute very little you do n't have to pay any tax or you just buy one of these things and it , it , uh , maybe you , you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe and , uh , the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe and you could n't start your car anymore . That 's a , that 's an interesting concept . Is that your idea ? Yeah , but , uh , you know , it 's , uh , I guess the difficulty would be to , that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something . Well I was going to say , right . You could put it in , you could , you could , it could be installed like a catalytic converter . Right . I mean I guess you could take those off too but , You could take ca- , but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off . Yeah , if you can take a muffler off and only replace , well not unless it was built into every muffler . Right . And that 's MUMBLEx . But if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that , uh , busses and any kind of vehicle , had to pay a pollution tax , uh , this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters , That 's a , that 's quite a concept . You should , uh , pursue that I think , or patent it , you know . Yeah , patent it , that 's a good idea .
