I have n't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately we 've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going . Yeah , it 's a good time for gardening . Oh , yeah , it 's been beautiful this last week but , I could do with a little less wind , but I think the , the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside . Yeah . Do you find you do most of your , your , uh , crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time ? I usually start in the fall . Yeah . And my husband says I do it , you know , make afghans so I can keep my lap warm . Well , that 's kind of what my wife says .
