What do you think about the , uh , Peace Corps or public service commitment ? Uh , that 's the first I 've ever heard of it . I have n't heard of it , anything too much about it . Um , Well , I think it was , uh , thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft and people said , well , they , uh , young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country , but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from , um , some sort of public service , Uh-huh . like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or , uh , various other things of that sort . And it seems to me that it 's , it 's not a totally bad idea , but I do n't quite see how they 'd make it work . Uh-huh .
