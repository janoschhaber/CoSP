Well , anyway I , uh , I , uh , oh , yeah . I did forget to ask you . What is your name by the way ? Uh , I 'm Ann . Oh , you 're Ann . Hi . But , uh , anyway , I , uh , lot of , lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good , be a good change if we 're going to be talking about the subject t- , tonight which in some I guess criminal courts the , Criminal courts ? Yes . Yeah . Th- , the one of which was , uh , something , something that 's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town and that is , uh , and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race .

And there 's been a lot made in the local papers of that , I see . fact . I ca n't , I 'm a little surprised they did n't get a change of venue on that one . They have . They have . They moved it up to the county north of here . Oh . Um , it 's in Ventura and there 's , there 's still quite a bit of publicity obviously , and it 's kind of , it 's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that , uh , that , Well , that videotape was just horrible .

Exactly . You know , um , the you know ,
