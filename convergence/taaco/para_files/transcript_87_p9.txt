I do know . Yeah . I have done a little bit of that , but I decided that that 's something that demands my tim- , my , my total attention . Uh-huh . And so I 've got to have total , almost total silence . I ca n't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate . It sounds like you 'd have lots of shading -- Uh-huh . -- on that particular piece . Yep . It is not , does not sound like an easy one to finish . No , it really is n't , and I tell you , really , I could just kick myself for even starting it , because I have a feeling I 'm never going to get it done . I 'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life . Oh , I 'm sure you 'll get it done , but it just may not of the original , obviously not of the original time schedule . No , that 's true . I , I just do n't know when I 'm ever , it just seems like there 's just never enough time to pick it up and do it , you know , it 's just really hard . But I really do en , like I said I really enjoy it when I do . It 's just hard . Just hard finding the time -- Uh-huh . -- that can be dedicated . And there 's , there 's so many other things that , I , I have done , you know , in the meantime , like I said , so many baby gifts . I 've made a lot of bibs , and wall hangings , and so , you know , those do n't take much time at all . So it 's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them . Do you , do you use patterns , I mean , like a book of patterns , or do you go out an buy a , a kit , like for a bib or something like that . No , I usually just buy a pattern book . I have several pattern books , and I just go with those . Okay .
