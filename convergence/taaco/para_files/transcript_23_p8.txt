Yes , when I first started teaching , I remember I went to my MUMBLEx and I said , okay , I want to see a curriculum guide , you know , so I 'll know what I 'm suppose to teach and they go , we do n't have one . We do n't even know where one is . Oh , God . And so I go , okay , I mean , you just , you did , what you wanted to do , How funny . and now they tell you what to teach and how long and , you know , what day , Yeah , you do n't know which is , what period . you do n't know , which is worse . Yeah . No , I know which is worse . Yeah , I guess so . Yeah , being told what to do is worse . Uh-huh . So , how long are we suppose to talk for ? Well , you can talk for ten minutes but you do n't have to . Oh , you can ? Yeah , and no , if you talk to ten then they come ov- , on and say , oh , you 've extended your limit , and please say good-bye within the next five seconds .
