Yeah , and institutionally , like here at the university , oh if there is a cut back , well gee , it 's not where it necessarily where it 's needed , it 's where it 's most expedient which , Expedient , yeah that 's exactly it . Yeah , where the most dollar , where , where you know it cuts back the most . Well , in one sense for us , it 's where it makes the least noise which means it 's -- Oh . -- often the lowest support type roles . Oh . See , yeah . So we , Yeah . I think that 's one of the things too . You get too many management people , you know . It 's very easy . Yeah and it 's very easy for them to say , oh this is the best way when they really are n't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know . Yeah . And then they wonder why it does n't get done in the same amount of time . Well , those people are n't there anymore . Right . Because it 's support people that are providing -- Yeah . -- the speed for it . Uh-huh . Yeah , but , so what else do you think is important ? Well the , uh , that 's maybe the majority of the importance , I guess . Yeah , because my perspective is from an institution , uh , the , there is not much incentive for innovativeness -- Uh-huh . -- because the limitation for reward is very severe -- Uh-huh . -- but if you 're in the corporate world , I think there is considerable motivation for I guess in- , innovation , although he , you know , the more complex your structure the , uh , less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through -- Uh-huh . -- but , uh , I think there is , uh , it 's a long term type of process where in a small organization it 's , uh , things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts . I think probably in a small , yeah , I was going to say more , it 's more personal for one thing . You probably have a better team , uh , cooperation , or team playing , atmosphere . Right .
