Well , it looks like it 's just about as volatile as it usually is . Uh-huh . What do you think , Mark ? Yeah , I agree . I think , I think there 's definitely been some changes , um , and I think you know , the , the , um , end of the Soviet Union will definitely have its effect on , on the situation . Oh , yeah . Um , you know , in that there 's , there 's not , you kno , there , you know , i- , you know , basically since the end of World War two there was always , you know , that little proxy war going on . Uh-huh . You know , with , um , the U S funding Israel and , and the , um , Soviet Union funding the Arab countries . And then we 'll see what happens when , uh , they 're not funded quite as much . Yeah . Or supplied with arms the same way . Uh-huh . Yeah , but on the same token , you know , Israel has lost a lot of their , you know , value to the U S in being , you know , the foothold of capitalism . Uh-huh . You know in , in the Mideast . Well , I , we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves , Uh-huh . you know , we s- , kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet -- Uh-huh . -- overall tend to support them . But , I think one of the most interesting things to me recently was , you know , during the war , Uh-huh . uh , in , uh , Kuwait was , uh , the fact that they did not retaliate , Uh-huh . for the , uh , scud missiles that were , uh , launched there . That just seemed to me to be a , uh , a phenomenal , uh , demonstration of restraint , and it must have reflected , uh , uh , some awful good , uh , diplomacy on the part of the U S . Uh-huh . Yeah , but on the other hand , you know , if they would have had a hard time retaliating because the , you know , they , they would n't have been given access to the friend or foe codes .
