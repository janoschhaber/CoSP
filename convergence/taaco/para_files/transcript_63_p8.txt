Uh-huh . -- and I think they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about . Uh-huh . So . I always thought that was kind of weird . Yeah , it 's funny how we , uh , we , we romanticize people -- Uh-huh . -- like , for instance , where as the teenager , you know , you romance a , romanticize a rock star , but when he gets married , then you do n't care any more -- Um , right . -- or something like that , and I think it 's the same with your characters on T V . Do you think that 's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret , or at least they keep it quiet . Probably , yeah -- I mean , -- I know it affected me when I was younger . I 'm not into rock stars -- Yeah . -- too much lately , but , No , like Madonna and Sean Penn . Now I do n't particularly like either one of them -- Uh-huh . -- but , um , uh , their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together -- Yeah .
