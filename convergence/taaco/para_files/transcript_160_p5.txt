on getting any guns . And I think that , I would definitely support that . Shoot that 's a good idea . Yeah . I , I , I agree the thing that scares me , uh , though about where I would , I would wa- , definitely want some sort of legislation and coming from the north east , I 'm just not used to seeing , um , these , and I , I know this may sound kind of stereo typical but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks . Oh , sure . That 's kind of scary to me that kind of , to me it is more like vigilantism . Uh-huh . You know , and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on , Right . in L A , on the freeways , Yeah , that 's crazy . and then you come here in , in the Dallas area , um , I do n't , I do n't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles . Yeah , that 's kind of , kind of wild . Um , especially not in the back window , Uh-huh . for everybody to see . That is kind of wild . Well , that 's all very interesting . Well , thanks for talking . Sure you 're welcome . Good-bye . Okay , bye-bye .
