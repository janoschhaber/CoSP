It 's just like if you 've got like a dog that 's running wild and biting people -- Uh-huh . -- put it to sleep , you know . Just get it out , you know , it 's not able to fit in , you know . Something inexpensive . Yeah . Yeah , exactly . Uh , I guess , kind of the way I think about it also , is they just , if somebody gets the death penalty , they 're , they 're judged guilty , they got the death penalty , they should have one year and one appeal . Cover all their bases with one appeal and if not , you know , do n't , do n't let them sit up there on death row for , you know , fifteen years . Yeah . I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years . Uh-huh . Yeah , that , But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and -- Yeah . Oh , I 'm sure . -- you 'd hate to be one of those . Yeah . The other thing they asked about was whether uh , uh , the verdict should be required to be unanimous . Uh-huh . Which , again , I think is the way it is now . That all the , all verdicts , well maybe not . I do n't know . At least in capital cases I 'd think they 'd have to be -- I believe it is -- -- unanimous . -- in capital . I think in like , uh , lesser cases it 's like ten out of twelve or five out of six , whatever . Uh-huh . How ever many is on , sitting on a jury .
