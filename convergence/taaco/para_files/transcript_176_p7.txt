I just have a feeling that the military involvement is n't over yet . That I , I still feel like there 's more to come . I do n't think this whole issue is settled as far as we 're concerned . Well you know what I was hoping ? I was hoping Iran was going to take a very , um , dramatic stand and invade , you know , and then like Iran 's the big bad guy , you know , but , really , if , if they were going to save people 's lives , They 've got sixty or so of Iraq 's planes . Yeah , I know , it 's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict but , I , I , you know , I almost swear , I 'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians , why they did n't go save , I mean , I do n't know if the Kurdish , I know the Shiites are their people . Uh-huh . But , I do n't know , I think they have a bond with the , the Kurds . There are some Kurds living in Iran . Yeah , I , I think they should have just done more , uh , and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid . It 's , it 's just so complicated . I was real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as , as much as they did . Oh , yeah , well , you , knowing them , they 're very , um , oh , I do n't know , almost compare them to a very egotistical man . Uh-huh . You 're damn right , I 'm going to protect my family , you know , so , I , I was amazed too . I was really , I was really , um , proud of them , though , that they stayed out of it . But , Yeah , it and from , from what I can tell if they had gotten into it , it would have started a whole new war . Oh MUMBLEx yeah , I was , I that part scared me . That , that , um , the Egyptians would pull out and I just saw atomic bomb ,
