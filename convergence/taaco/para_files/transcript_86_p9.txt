I , I actually take both newspapers on the weekends . Do you ? I figure I 'm only taking on the weekend , and I can afford that . Yeah . I , I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better , but I sort of have a liberal political slant , and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial , um , outlook . And my , I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit . My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers . He takes both San Antonio papers , an Austin paper , both Houston papers , I guess he takes seven , the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper , but he 's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University , so he 's getting all the sports sections . Uh-huh . And , so , you know , he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread ...
