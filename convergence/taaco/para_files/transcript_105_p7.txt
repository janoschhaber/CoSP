Then I did n't notice any improvement till the , after the sixth one . Uh-huh . And ever since , and he said , uh , a booster , uh , every year or two , Uh-huh . I mean , maybe every six months or , or something like that and when I notice in the winter , when it 's worse , you know , it 's cold weather and so forth then I have , uh , gotten a booster for her . But not many people in this part of the country know anything about MUMBLEx . Um . I 've had to get it from Oklahoma . They 've heard about it but they 've really never used it . Uh-huh , yeah , I 've never heard anything about it either . So dogs that get down in the hips , like I think German Shepherds do it , and probably large dogs . Uh-huh . And , uh , it 's just wonderful . Does he get , is he an inside dog also , Uh . or does he just run out in the backyard ? Is he fenced in ? Um , um , well we 're living now in an area where we , we , we 're in the woods
