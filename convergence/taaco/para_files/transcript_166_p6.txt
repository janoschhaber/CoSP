I do n't know if it 's a government run or if it 's a private -- I do n't either . -- charity that 's put it together . But I know that that helps a lot with training and , um -- Yeah , out here in California , -- a lot of , there 's a program like that for , uh , juvenile delinquents , the , the ones that are not dangerous and they do n't have to be locked up go to these , uh , camps . And they , Uh-huh . do forestry work . They maintain trails and they , uh , put up signs and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort . Uh-huh . And that I know is run by the State , but there may be other things . I 'm not so sure what kind of , uh , training that is for the future for those kids . Yeah , how much benefit , It 's probably a , it 'll do them in the long run ? a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble , but whether it 's something that they can put to , to economic use later on is a different subject . Right , especially in , you know , if you take a , a child that 's from the inner city and then put them in the , a middle of a park , if they go back to the inner city , they may not see trees for a while , That 's true . much less be able to take care of them . Good point , oh . So that 's , yeah , so that may not , may not benefit them in the long run . Yeah . But , Yeah , I 'm sorry , I 'm going to have to go , but my other line is blinking . Okay , well , thank you . But it was good to talk to you . You , too , bye-bye .
