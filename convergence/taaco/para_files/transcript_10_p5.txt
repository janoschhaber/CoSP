Yes , yes it is . Down in the more southern and western areas . And , of course we are , um , about two hours from the northern border , straight south , Yeah . and , and , uh , very windy . It 's amazing to me because I have only lived in Dallas for three years , and I can not believe that the wind blows all the time .
