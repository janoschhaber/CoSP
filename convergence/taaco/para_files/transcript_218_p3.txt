But , Did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of , Oh , just our own design . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Gosh . And the , so , but we 've had budgets that did n't work when our , uh , you know , of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked .
