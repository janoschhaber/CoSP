I know one of my friends was , uh , uh , brought up for jury duty . Yeah . For , and he only heard very , you know , piddly type cases . Most of it was , uh , robberies or things like that , you know , it was not any serious crimes . So apparently even for the smallest crimes , they give the person the , you know , any felony anyways . Yeah . Well , I guess we , Th- , they give the person the option for a jury . Yeah . I guess we always focus on criminal trials with th- , with the jury . But I know you have a right to ask for a jury in , Uh-huh . in any sort of a case that even where damages are , are , are , uh , are the result of some sort of a , uh , an action that you are bringing against someone else . You can ask -- Uh-huh . -- for that to be heard before a jury . Takes a heck of a long time , I guess , to get there -- Uh-huh . -- in some states .
