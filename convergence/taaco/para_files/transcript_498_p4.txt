-- find out how reliable the test is , you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort . So it 's , involves a lot of spreadsheet use . Yeah , I would imagine so . Um , so , um , what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E ? Well , I was doing some of the same stuff , but doing it more slowly , and with smaller files . I ca n't believe , you know , I 've got , uh , five , uh , megabytes on this one now -- Uh-huh . It , it 's MUMBLEx . -- and on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K . Yes , it 's amazing , you know , how , how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much . I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it -- Yeah . -- and you know , then , then we , then I started playing with Apples , you know , and those had forty-eight , or , you know , if they were really great -- Oh , the old -- -- they had sixty-four K . -- the old Apple , uh , the , the original Apple had , what , yeah , forty-eight I guess , did n't it . Uh , I know , I know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them , is all , and -- My goodness . -- there 's , I remember that there was one game that I played that required forty-eight K and there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time . Uh-huh . And you know it 's just so amazing that generally , you know , if you , if you , I 'm not sure about Macintoshes , but I know I B M -s , you , you generally , you know , you buy a megabyte at a time . Uh-huh . You know , that 's , that 's your low , that 's the low end . Uh . Well the S P thirty goes up to eight -- Uh-huh . -- but I have n't upgraded it quite that far yet .
