because that 's , you know , that 's , that area of the world I think would be great . Yeah . It was a very interesting vacation . The only thing I did n't like was in some of the more touristy areas -- Uh-huh . -- uh , um , the , it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide and you , there were some places , Yeah . where people , defini- , there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off , Uh-huh . and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in , you know , in jacket underneath a coat type of thing . Really . But , We , we found that in Jamaica . It was the same way , Uh-huh . that people would come up and try and sell you , well try and sell drugs and things like that but they , they were so destitute and I guess they , they make all their money on tourism and , and they would come up and ask you , you know , if , if you want to buy different things and really , after awhile it really gets annoying , Yeah . you know , it , it 's a little scary too when they 're coming up and they 're all over you . The , the worst place was in Marrakech -- Uh-huh . -- and the other cities it was n't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was , what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide -- Uh-huh . -- it does n't matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you . Oh really .
