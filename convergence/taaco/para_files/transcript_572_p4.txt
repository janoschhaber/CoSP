but , uh , it used to be a long time ago , I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment , if somebody did something , for example , to your family , then you had the right to administer the punishment . So if somebody killed somebody in your family , then you had the right to , uh , if that person was caught and found guilty , you had the right to , uh , execute that person . And I know that , uh , if somebody had done something to my family , I would feel that I had the right to , to get revenge on them and , uh , but , I , I do n't think that 's done much anywhere . That 's kind of drastic punishment . Well , I think that would be kind of drastic punishment . Right . And , Might make you feel better but , But , one thing , I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation -- Uh-huh . -- then that chance sh , should be investigated . Right . But , like I said , if , if someone is , is just pathologically -- Uh-huh . -- going to murder people no matter what -- Right . -- then I think they should be eliminated from -- Uh-huh . -- society . Right , because they 're a danger to everybody else . Huh , that 's interesting . I have to , uh -- But , -- agree with that . There 's a lot of folks , probably , that are in prison that , uh , that are n't really a danger to society , huh , and , uh , And a lot of people that are a danger -- Right . -- to society that are n't in prison . Right , probably more of them then the other way around . Interesting . I do n't , I do n't , not sure I , I 'm in Washington , D C or at least very close to it . I 'm not sure what kind of , uh , capital punishment we have here . Well , I know in North Carolina , we do have capital punishment . Uh-huh . And I 'm in , I 'm from South Carolina .
