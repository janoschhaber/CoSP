Um , so , uh , but , uh , you know , the , not a lot I could do about it . Right . Ca n't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants . Crazy for him to but , Well , I have , I , I , I 've full- , I think I understood what the , what the kid was doing he was a , uh , well let 's just say he was one of th- , those types that you would n't doubt that he was selling something .

Uh , most the time if they were , they were , some of them were even better behaved . I 've only had two instances where I cou , it was really noticeable but they were better behaved when they were , um , I do n't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on but it ended up better but , Uh , I do n't know , guns and , I do n't know it 's something .

Uh-huh . And , uh , and I 'm not completely just , you know , just teach the basics in schools but I think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because ,
