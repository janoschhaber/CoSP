With the , you know , the little suspenders or something on so . That 's great . We 've , we 've kind of had a variety there but , I think a lot of times it 's , it 's mainly who they 're going to meet with , or they 're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that 's how they are . Yeah . If they 're just going to be meeting with T I -ers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the , they 're engineers that they 're talking too , they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they 're usually casual . That 's the way to do it . I mean that 's the smart way to do it . Yeah . It really is , because you 're making , you know , if when they 're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down , if they come in , in , you know , a six hundred dollar three piece suit , it 's going to make the people they 're meeting with feel very uncomfortable , you know , or it would me , you know . It 's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here . Yeah , yeah , look at this slick guy , I wonder what kind of money does he make , uh-huh . I can see it now . Well it was good to talk to you . It was really enjoyable . Yeah , this is , this is kind of a fun project . It really is . I 've done some of the other speech programs , but we 've never got to talk to another person , it was always just talking to the computer . Oh , yuck , yeah . So this is a little different . Well it 's kind of enjoyable , I 'm really looking forward to it . Yeah . Well thanks a lot . Okay , bye . Bye-bye .
