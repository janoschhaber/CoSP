I mean our red light district , I mean , uh , you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life , you know , Uh-huh . and we 're just so protected . But , it 's , it 's , over in the Mid East , especially Israel , it 's just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system , when it comes to the Palestinians . You know , the Israelis can do anything they want but when it comes to Palestinians , if they 're out in the street at night , it 's , it 's really looked on as odd . Um , usually they 're , they 're bussed in to the , the , um , Jewish neighborhoods , and the Jewish cities and then at night they 're bussed out to the occupied territories . Huh . So they do n't have that . But , uh , what do you think about the mess that 's , we 've created in Iraq ? I think it 's unfortunate , uh , as far as the Kurds are concerned , it , I thi , It 's just what do you do for them , you want to do something for them , but you do n't want to get so directly involved that you 're occupying the , the country . Yeah , yeah , we ca n't get involved in their civil war , um , unfortunately , but we 've kind of driven these people out . To do it , yeah , but you see President Bush is telling them rebel , you know , uh , uprise . And that 's what they did and now they 're like asking him for help and he 's like , no we ca n't get involved . What my husband had very strong feelings , he , uh , agreed with , um , the General Schwartzkopf , he said , um , he should have let , Bush should have let him finish his job . Sure . He should , he should have let them , um , corner the Republican Guards , Well I think the war ended too soon . Yeah , exactly , that 's what everyone says . Yeah . E- , everyone I talk to , they says , you know , it 's real easy to say that .
