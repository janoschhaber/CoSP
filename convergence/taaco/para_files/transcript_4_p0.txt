Yes , yes . Is , is that one that you 're talking about . That was the big one I 'm talking about . I work weird hours , and invariably just about the time , I 'm going to sleep , the phone tears off the wall . Uh-huh , uh-huh . And you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone , you either hear , the cli- , as soon as you say hello , you hear the click of the recording coming on , Uh-huh . or you hear somebody all ready starting , reading off a list of stuff that they 've read probably a thousand times that day already . That 's true , or the ones that are , are generated by a computer . It 's just a computer voice that comes on the line . Those are the ones that I really , really hate too . I 've even had some of them , the , they 're voice activated and you 've got to say hello twice before they 'll do anything . Uh-huh ,
