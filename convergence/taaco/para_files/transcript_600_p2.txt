You know , judges are people like everybody else -- That 's right . -- even though they 're , they 're supposed to be impartial but maybe , uh , And I think that may , I , that may be an exception as well . Because I think that , does n't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than , than the judge ? I , I think that 's , I think that 's the way it is . Yeah . Uh , whether they , they decide whether or not they , uh , the accused or whatever would get the , uh , get the death penalty . Do they have a death penalty in California ? . Yes . In -- Yeah . -- fact , they 're going to execute somebody at the end of this month . Uh-huh . And , uh , there 's a big uproar going on right now . Uh -- Yeah . -- the , uh , Governor , you know , has been trying to decide whether he 's going to commute it or not . Uh-huh . You know , it 's someone who had , uh , killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact . Yeah . I , something like that , I 've got no problem with it . Uh -- Yeah . -- I guess the way I think about it is not , it should n't necessarily be thought of as revenge .
