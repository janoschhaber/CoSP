Well , uh , Yes , other than nuking it . Um , in fact , Los Alamos , uh , has , uh , done a fair amount of research , uh , in recycling things in general . Um , it , it involves , for instance , uh , creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium , and barium and , uh , other things from , uh , waste material in general . And , uh , and purify the waste of specific , uh , uh , nasty elements . Well , is n't that a , that 's a , that 's pretty , uh , upscale , uh , trash , uh , uh , situation . I do n't think anybody around here would understand all the , all those exotic techniques , you know , getting -- And -- -- rid of the heavy metals .
