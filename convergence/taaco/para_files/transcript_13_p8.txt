so I called them and asked if I could participate . And , uh , Oh . You know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth . Right . We could go back to television shows . Well , you know , speaking of public TV , have you caught any of this series on the Bible ? Yes , I have . I 've heard that it 's really against the , well I mean that it 's coming out with the idea that the Bible 's not true . Well , no . That 's , uh , you could interpret it that way . Uh-huh . Uh , I , I think what they are trying to say , is that there is a great deal of historical truth , but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh , after the what , uh , was is it the King James Version when the committee did it , wrote the translation , that so much was lost in the translation , particularly since most of the translations were in Greek . Yeah . Well , for example . In Greek there are seven different words for love . Right . Okay , so you can have , there 's one word for love of your brother , one word for love of your wife , one word for , you know , uh , love of your father , and that sort of thing . So , in , as to those types of interpretations , uh , really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now , and what it 's at .
