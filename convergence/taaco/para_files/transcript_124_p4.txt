-- you know . Then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything . Yeah . So I do n't know . And I , I 'm not so sure they are that needed . Yeah , I 'm not -- -- sure either . The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it , then they have the right to go ahead and prove it because they say they can spot check . Ye- , if you 're using it while at a job , I can see a problem . Yeah . But the occasional person , then it 's almost like , it 's almost an infringement of your privacy . Well , it sort of is . And this is it , this , I 'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways . You know , as a health professional , I would n't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs . Yeah . You know , so as a patient , I feel well , yeah , we probably should be protected . But , on the other hand , there 's a lot of things I should be protected from that they do n't test my patients for too . So -- Yeah . -- you know , I guess you sort of , you have to have trust some place along the way .
