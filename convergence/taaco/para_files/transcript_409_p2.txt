Well , I 'm a drafter , so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes and I have sweatshirt on today . Uh-huh . And that 's pretty much the norm for me . If I come in in a dress , everybody 's shocked . Yeah , I understand . They ask me , you know , what are you doing in a dress and it 's usually I have n't done my laundry lately . Right . Ran out of jeans . I understand , that 's funny . So , does it change ? No . Your dress , no . No , huh-uh . So , or , I guess , do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that ? No , huh-uh . So , back in my old job , up until through nineteen eighty -- Uh-huh . -- I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like , but , probably once a month or so , there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit . Yeah . For a customer presentation or something . Yeah , yeah .
