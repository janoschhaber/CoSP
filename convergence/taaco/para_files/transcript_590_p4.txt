I , I , I mean I just ca n't even picture how that could happen . Yeah . You know , except maybe to someone who 's , you know , really badly learning , uh , disabled or something . But these people obviously were n't . That 's hard for me to say since I did n't , I did n't really grow , well when I went to elementary school it , it was n't in a great area but I still , I mean , I learned to read , started learning to read when I was in kindergarten , you know . Yeah . So I guess I ca n't really -- Yeah . -- I ca n't say what it would be like to , uh , grow up in a really oppressed region . Yeah . You know , I guess the whole , the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the MUMBLEx people . Yeah . And I think that 's almost a bigger factor , than anything else probably . I mean , I do n't , I think you know , people just , So , I guess the problem is the , the thing to do is to try to , uh , to get some kind of motivation to learn and , Yeah . And , again , I do n't , I mean they got to know the , you know , how qualified , I mean , MUMBLEx I think it 'd be interesting -- Uh-huh . -- to , you know , to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school . Uh , you know , sort , sort of maybe from elementary through , uh , high school . Yeah . You know , just sort of to get a feel for what it 's like . Uh-huh . I think that 'd be an interesting experience . But , uh , I have n't done that . No , I , I ca n't say that I have either . But , uh , But I do , I do think that , uh , I mean , public education in general I think can work . And I think it 's a good thing . Yeah .
