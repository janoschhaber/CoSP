Well , do you have any pets ? Yes I do . I have a dog named Grisly , who 's a ten year old , uh , mixed breed between Golden Retriever , Afghan Hound and Chow . Oh . And I have a pair of box turtles . Oh , I used to have box turtles , um , well , years ago , when I was growing up -- Yeah , -- I , I really like them . Oh , yeah , I do , too . Lucky and Spot , that 's their names -- Oh . -- and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room , and my dog thinks he 's a mother turtle , and always has his nose all around my turtle box , so do you have any pets now ? Yes , um , we have one dog , a Bichon Frise . Um , our friends in Houston bred the dogs . I had never heard of them -- No , I have n't either . -- they 're , um , they 're all white and they 're small , and , um , and fluffy , they do n't shed . I guess they 're distantly related to a poodle , but they 're not very well known in this country , and they 're not , um , high strung or over bred -- Oh .
