All right , okay . Okay , so , uh , what do you think , that , uh , what do , what do , what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America ? Oh , if I knew that I 'd be a very wealthy person . Yeah , but what , what , what are the steps ? Well , you have to see , I , the way I look at it , you have to think first of all why , or ha , has crime increased , and if so , why has crime increased ? Well , see the problem is , is that , um , what happens is as , that you 're , uh , you know , as you go from the country to a city , crime always increases , right ? Uh-huh . Because in the country , people still respect , uh , the property of other people . Right . And so , as , as , and the people in the country do n't want as much as the people in the city . Uh-huh . Now what happens is all those that do n't have any money in the country move to the cities , and they rush to get the same thing . They say , why ca n't we have the same things that these other people have , and the thing that we can do is , we need money for drugs , and what we have to do is , we have to go , uh , get some stuff , steal it , and then , you know , just resell it . It 's easy , you said the magic word there . Which one ? Drugs . Yeah . And that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased . That 's , uh , that 's , uh , the main reason I think , uh , everywhere because , uh , you have deaths . I mean , I mean , you have murders and you have , you know , people stealing other people 's stuff , and that 's a lot of it has to do with drugs . Oh , yes . It does n't have to do , I mean , the thing is is that , you know , it 's like you might be standing somewhere , right , and like let 's say you , you 're , you 're , you know , you 're driving out and you 're driving back home and it 's late at night . And you stop by one of these , you know , twenty-four hour , you know , gas stations joints .
