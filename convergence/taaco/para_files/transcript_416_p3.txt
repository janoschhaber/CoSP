Uh-huh . But , Yeah , uh , except that the rumor is , is that they still might , but it may not include the entire crew and it will be a next generation meets this generation . Huh . So , I 'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the , the old guys was . I think it 's a hundred years . Huh . Somewhere in that range . Considering that Spock was on an , uh , you know , couple weeks ago -- Oh , that 's right . -- and that the , the very first episode of NEXT GENERATION , they had McCoy . Is that right ? He was -- And , -- a doctor -- Uh-huh . -- still ? Yeah , well , you know , he was rear admiral , whatever , you know , and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow . Vulcans age a lot better . Well , yeah , he did n't look too bad , did he ? No , huh-uh . Matter of fact , he looks just as about as old and the , uh , NEXT GENERATION as he does in the latest STAR TREK . Imagine that . Yeah , that 's amazing . But , did they have some pretty good special effects ? Oh , excellent , excellent special effects . But I think the script was , you know , just incredible compared to the last one . Yeah , FIVE was , the script was bad , bad , bad . Well , you know why ? No , I do n't . Why ? Uh , William Shatner wrote it . Oh , is that right ? And even worse , he directed it . Uh , L- , Leonard , s- , Nimoy , he does a lot better . Oh , yeah , he , in fact , uh , he did n't direct this one . He produced this one . But he directed the one before , uh , I think STAR TREK FOUR , something like that . IN SEARCH OF SPOCK , or , no , JOURNEY HOME , I think that was . Yeah , uh-huh . Are , you 're a real life Trekkie ?
