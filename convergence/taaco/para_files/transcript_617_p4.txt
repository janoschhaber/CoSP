I 'm , I , but there , this is , this is , tax not tax revolt country . I mean there 's too many , every one of us , most of us have our , have all four feet in the trough , you know . Plus our snout , right up to our ears . Yeah . So , you know , it 's not exactly that kind of a place that , that you want to , you know , get into a tax revolt situation . Right .

Is , is how to be able to , to lessen their cost of living . You know , I 'm , I 'm five or six MUMBLEx years before I 'm eligible to retire and , and I 'm saying well , you know , I really ca n't stay here , uh , as a retiree . After you retire ,
