Okay . Okay . What 's , what 's your most recent one that you 've seen ? Well actually , what I do , I have n't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months , Uh-huh . so I have n't really seen any movies in the movie theater but I rent probably four or five movies a week . Really , I used to do that too , but I have n't been doing it lately but , We 've got a good video place out here
