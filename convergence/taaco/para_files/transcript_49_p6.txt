Yeah , I think I heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something , you know . No , in , in the book apparently she cuts his feet off , but in the movie she , she disables him , but not by cutting his feet . Um . Um , she , she breaks both of his ankles . Ugh . And that I could n't watch , and , but , you know , you could tell when it was coming . Yeah . So yeah , um , that was so that he could n't leave her , cause she , It still just seems a little twisted to me . Yeah , yeah I 'm not sure I would have enjoyed that at all .
