Uh-huh . And I , boy that 's a nice , a nice place to visit . It 's really nice at , there 's a nice , nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining . Right . And , uh , and then actually , north , north of that is another town and , a smaller , on a smaller scale , I guess , than Silverton . But , I , and then there 's lots and lots of real , of mountains that are covered with , uh , boulders . Uh-huh . So , I guess people Jeep through that area and we did not have a chance to do that . But , I sure would like to go back there and do that again . Right . We are , uh , we have not had a vacation in several years , so , be our first chance in awhile , uh , we are going to go to , uh , Destin , Florida , which is a very nice beach area , if you are not familiar with it . I have not been , but I have heard it 's wonderful . Oh , it 's , it 's gorgeous .
