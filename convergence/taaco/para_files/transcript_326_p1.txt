So , uh , there was something else I was going to , and I 'm like you . I 've just lost a train of thought that I had . But they have been more , little more s- , effective in Oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it . Now if you just lose , if you just skip one election ? No , three . Three . You have to lo , you have to skip three . Uh-huh . And , uh , of course , those can be , they can be , oh , a long time apart but , um ... I think that 's an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it . Of course , what do you think and this is not one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting ? No excuse . Uh , I 'm not sure if I 'm familiar with that , Okay . or not . I 'm sure all over the State of Texas now you have three weeks to go for absentee balloting . Uh-huh . And you do n't have to h , be sick , out of town or anything .
