-- I think it comes in a forty-pound bag , and it 's real fine , like flour -- Uh-huh . -- and you just -- Yeah . -- go out , and do the entire yard , and you , I mean , you do n't have to put clumps of it , just very lightly cover the entire yard . Really ? Well , I 'll have to remember that , because hopefully we wo n't have them this year , but we have a cat that comes in and out , and the cat was getting , um , fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house , so we had a real problem last year with fleas , and uh , it was quite a drag because , um , we got them in our house , and we 're Christians , and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas , and we got rid of them , believe it or not , with smoke bombs , which is just about impossible to do , but we did , and so we do n't want them back this year , you know ? so I 'll remember that if we see it 's a problem in the yard . we 're almost , they were so bad last year , even ticks . I do n't know , we 've had ticks before a lot , and we 've had to get out and treat our lawn for that . I think we used Dursban for the , we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing , you know , and spread it all out everywhere , but that 's about the extent of our lawn care . So , I do n't know , do you enjoy doing it ? Oh , I love it . My wife ca n't understand it 'd be a hundred degrees outside , I 'll be out there . But it 's too hot to be working in the yard . I 'm under the trees , I 'm having fun , and I 'm stopping to drink water , so what 's the problem ? . Yeah , well that 's , well that 's funny .
