Is that right . I guess , uh , the only rule , uh , I can think of is that I like to look for places with , uh , good respectable , nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that . If they 're associated with a college or a university , they 're usually a pretty good bet . Huh . Uh , I think it 's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something . You 'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care . I guess not , usu- , I suppose you 're absolutely right there . Yeah . For profit -- Uh-huh . -- places , I would really look at them awfully carefully but , uh , when I was when my kids were young , I was teaching at a university and , uh , the child care center associated with our university was quite good so -- Uh-huh . -- I felt confident that they 'd do right . Of , are n't do n't they kind of use them for , everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs ? For their per- , for their pet theories or some such thing ? Yes . But , yeah , I suppose , uh , if you 're , if there is a psychology department or an education department around , you might find you might find that they 're pushing one form of education or another , I guess that 's true . But , uh , I never had bad experience in that respect . Of course , you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents , and they , you know , pretty good people . Um . Well , the thing I really worry about is , uh , the sexual abuse cases you read about . Uh-huh .
