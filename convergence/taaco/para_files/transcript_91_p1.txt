Well , I heard a , a frightening thing . Actually , I did n't hear it . It was told to me or suggested to me , uh , that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of Texas , and I think it 's similar in , in many other states , if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage -- Huh . -- of , uh , people to teach math and sciences . And somebody said , well , you know , you could go in and , and substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day and there 's always going to be , you know , somebody having a need for a math or science teacher . I thought , Christ , they 're letting me in , -- Yeah . -- to , you know , this would be , this would be frightening . I do n't know anything about it . That 's pretty interesting because just , just because you know a subject matter -- Right .
