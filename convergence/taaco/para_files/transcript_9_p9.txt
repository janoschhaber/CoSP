But I 'll go in in pants . I mean today I had on a pair of , you know , navy blue dress slacks and , and , uh , like a peach colored top and , you know , not cruddy , but not a dress either . And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would , will hold you back , you know , if you do n't dress in , you know , your dress for success business suits everyday if , you know , if upper management does n't notice that and remember that later on , but , you know , I do n't know if they do or not . You know , I see a lot of the managers and they 're in jeans , so , you know . Some of our people in the legal department , we have , um , assistants to the general counsel and it 's funny because , there 's one that always wears a suit . A matter of fact , he 's never seen without his jacket to the suit on , buttoned . Really , wow . And then there 's another one who 's , who 's a little younger and a little more yuppish and he 's always kind of like in the khaki pants and , you know , a shirt , Uh-huh . and sometimes he wears the jacket to it . Yeah . And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt . So that 's just , Is n't that funny .
