You do n't know that , uh , you know . You really , y- , you do n't know what it 's going to until it 's all over . Uh , to give you an example . My mom had an elderly cat who , uh , whoever evidently got a hold of it and , uh , the cat got sick . So she took the cat to the vet and she had the cat there for two days and then the cat died . So the doctor had called her up and said , uh , your cat died and you owe me this bill , and oh , by the way , do you want me to , to bury the cat . So , it cost her three hundred dollars , uh , and she did n't get the cat back . So , yeah , they had to pay for all the medical , uh , bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses . And , uh , you know , she just brought the cat in because he was n't feeling good . So that -- Really . Geez . -- that was kind of a surprise
