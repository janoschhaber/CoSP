Well , they just , they seem to make it so easy to save . You know , one of the things that we 're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world , but I 've got money coming out MUMBLEx to buy savings bonds , just coming straight out of my check . And it 's probably not a great investment , but if I was n't doing that the money would n't be being saved anyway , you know . I kind of have to trade off , you know . If you never see it you do n't spend it , so . And it 's , I unders , understand though , it , Yeah . Uh , believe me , I do that myself . Do you ? Yeah ? And I disagree with you . I do n't think it 's the worst investment , Do you really not ? in the world . I , I , fr- , you know , I , I debate about whether it 's really good or not , you know . Well , it 's , in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you do n't start looking for that word guaranteed , Yeah . until later . Yeah . Uh , it 's shown a history that , uh , sure beats anything else . Yeah , that 's true . That 's very true . Over many , many years . We went , uh , and did a , a thing through I B S which is a , like a financial consultant type thing here in Dallas and , uh , one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was , you know , they work up this whole big , you know , proposal , profile for you , that , ev- , all the things that you need to work on and you need to do . And then one of the things that we talked about with her was , you know , the need to save for our son 's education . We have a two year old , you know , and , and , you know , we ca n't start saving for college when he 's sixteen , you know , we have to do that now . And , and uh , they have a way that they can figure , you know , what , you know , and he 's two now , in sixteen years when he 's ready to go to college , this is how much it 'll cost , you know , and it 's just really scary the thought of how much it 's going to ,
