Um , factories that , that burn coal as a , an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants , you know , and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides . Uh-huh . Uh , those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain , and I think that 's , that 's probably hurting us a little bit .
