well , uh , our kids are kind of still small now , and we had thought before maybe a lot older we do n't need such a large house that we 'll sell it , but he will not build a second one himself . I see , well , Because he says age-wise he 'll never be able to handle that again . First one is always a bear . Yes , yes . We 're having a , an architect friend of mine design a house for us and that can basically be , be put on any lot , in any state , any kin- , you know , so that 's kind of , Oh . we just got with him and told him what all we wanted , Uh-huh . and he 's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it and he 's re , certified , and registered so at least we know we 're , it 's not going to fall in or something if it 's built . Yeah , oh .

But , uh , like I said otherwise , you know , a- , the expense , but , you know , we could not have one as large as we have if , you know , we had n't did it ourselves . Sure , I can imagine . Yeah , I mean it 's not an Eldorado house or anything like that , but , you know , it 's ours . If you 're happy with it , that 's all that counts . That 's right .
