Okay , what do you usually wear to work ? . Well , uh , I am basically retired now . Uh-huh . I was a member , I was in education and in administration , Uh-huh . Uh-huh . And , uh , heels , and I was never one , uh , because my work often took me into court , uh , never was one that got , uh , accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work . Uh-huh . But that was just me . I know many people are co , very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants . Uh , it , I guess I was just old enough not to , uh , be very comfortable in it . Uh-huh . How about you ? Well , I work at T I and they do n't really have , uh , dress code , so to speak there . It 's pretty lax about , um , you know , we- , you can pretty much wear whatever you want to , and I wear anything from jeans , when I 'm feeling really casual to , uh , suits and dresses when I 'm meeting with a customer Oh . and so when I 'm teaching a class , obviously I wear a suit or dress , Uh-huh . It , it , uh , definitely fluctuates mainly with what I 'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is and when it 's raining , I 'm more likely to wear jeans and , and when it 's really cold I 'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters , or that type of thing . Uh-huh . Um , but it just really depends on the weather and my mood and then , you know , obviously when I 'm doing anything that I 'm in front of people , or , or making presentations , teaching , whatever . Yes . I 'm going to dress up more . And I think that does make a difference , because when you do have to be in front of people , Uh-huh . uh , I think you , the , the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and , and , uh , more classical style of clothing . Uh-huh .
