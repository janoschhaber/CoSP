I thi , yeah , the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so , uh , dramatic that you almost think , now wait a minute , you know , we 're getting stuck into something here , you know , if , Uh-huh . if somebody 's about to , to clobber you , the first thing they do is sort of say , well , you know , we 're , we 're ashamed , we 're not going to do that anymore . Exactly . And , uh , , um , you know , I 'd , I 'd like to think that that is n't true but I , I , you know , the evidence is that , uh , you know , he 's , he 's let some , some stuff go , you know , the east German situation . Right . It 's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible , you know , if I 'd have been asleep for five years , and read it in a book , I said , no , no , no , that did n't , could n't have happened that way . Right .

Uh-huh , uh-huh . And finally , you know , who knows maybe they 're finally waking up and saying , you know , we ca n't afford this . Uh , the U S is n't the threat that we 've always made them out to be , Uh-huh . you know , even if they 're saying that beneath the doors . But it 's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period . Yeah .
