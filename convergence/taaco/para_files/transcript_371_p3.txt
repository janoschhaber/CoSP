Oh , yeah , Ooh . I 've , I 've heard some horrible , horrible stories about high , high school teachers -- Uh-huh . -- and , you know , to be , be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school . Uh-huh . Um . Um , that 's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system . I think , with what they have to work with , I think they 're doing a pretty good job right now . Oh , I do too , I think they 're doing real good job . Uh-huh , so . But , then , what do I know , -- -- I do n't have any kids . No , none at all .
