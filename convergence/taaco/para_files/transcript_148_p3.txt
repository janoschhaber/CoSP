It has , w- , to see it on the big screen because it 's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you 've ever seen in your life . And it 's all this , it 's the story of this little cat and dog and it 's not like cutesy . It 's just , uh , it 's just so realistic . Everything they do . You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things . Huh . Oh , those -- And it was , -- a real dog and cat ? A real dog and -- Huh . -- cat and all the other animals . They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they 're raised . And then the cat gets , um , on this treacherous journey . He climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river and he winds up all over creation . I do n't know where in the world it is . Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was filmed . Huh .
