just recently this , uh , black man served nine years was it , And then , for robbery . there was the black woman that , uh , robbed and shot the furrier . And she was set free , too , just in two examples in Texas recently . Uh-huh . But she actually killed the furrier . Or someone , she was charged with murder and then , then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something . I did n't , I do n't , I did n't retain all those facts very well . But I know what you 're , what if we make a mistake . That 's it . And that 's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything . Uh-huh . Well , right now our laws are so liberal that , uh , even with the death penalty in effect , I do n't think that , uh , they 're going to use it , uh , too frequently , uh , unfortunately . I , like you , say yes let 's have it , Well , put them all , give them all a shot , get rid of them . Why should they be sit , sitting in , uh , prison getting their college degree . Well , I guess , though , where I would have a problem with it if I were on the jury that , that , put , that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person 's guilty . Uh-huh . Now that 's tougher . It 's easier to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that , yeah , the death penalty 's the way to go , it 's a deterrent to crime , they should n't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway . But to be the actual one of the ones that decide , that would be tougher for me . Yes , very true . I , uh , I agree with you there .
