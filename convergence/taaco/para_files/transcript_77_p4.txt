that 's about the only thing I find , you know , disadvantageous to it . But , my criteria , is simply something that looks good , something that 's serviceable , and I , you know , I drive around a lot , but , uh , and it 's , you know , it 's very comfortable on the highway . I can drive for , you know , ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way . Uh-huh . But those are my criteria , and I , I probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again , and if there 's something out there that , uh , is comparable to what I have now , I 'll go ahead and get it . Uh-huh .
