The landscaping , the homes , the architecture , the whole thing -- Uh-huh . -- very enjoyable gardens , and my wife and I , Except for the lack of trees , out where we are . Well . It was all cotton fields , and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful , we really miss it . Yeah , that we have , you know -- Uh-huh . -- Ohio 's a very pretty state . We moved , in seventy-six we moved to Chicago , we lived there for five years , and I remember the first time I took my wife there on a house hunt , uh , we were coming in and before the plane landed she looked out the window and she said , she said , MUMBLEx there 's no trees down there . MUMBLEx this is Illinois , you 're not . And , when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house , there were no trees -- Um . -- because the farmers had cleared all the land -- Uh-huh . -- and now all of a sudden it was being developed , and the first thing I did was planted all kinds of trees ,
