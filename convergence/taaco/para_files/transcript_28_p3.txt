Yeah , well I guess this , the weather is n't as lively a topic as , uh , as some of the others we might have gotten . No , the other topics . I got one topic , they said talk about the Middle East situ- , well , I guess we 're supposed to say good-bye or something , and think about what my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye . We messed up the conversation , anyway . Well I mean I 've had some pretty bad , I guess some pretty controversial topics so it 's just like well that was my fault . But then the weather 's like , man , I mean , it gets pretty mundane , I mean you can only talk about , about the situation just so long . Yeah , I know , weather 's just not all that inspiring . Okay , well it 's nice talking to you .
