That 's going to affect our , uh , economy quite a bit . I think it will , uh , they , they keep claiming it 's going to have a big influence , but we 've yet to see it and th- , it 's real short term yet , though , I mean , it 's only been , three months or something like that -- Oh , yeah . -- since that happened so , Yeah . But they like to tell us that it 's going to be important . I 'm , I 'm pretty sure it is , because , uh -- I think it is , too . -- once , once Europe becomes unified and , uh , their economy becomes one big economy we 're going to be , uh , kind of hurting . Yeah , I , I think that 's a possibility , uh , it , we might also be helped , though , because it , it will be easier to do business over there , too . Yeah , definitely .
