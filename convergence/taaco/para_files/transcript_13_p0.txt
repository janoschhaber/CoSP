Okay , uh , my favorite show is MASTERPIECE THEATRE and it has been for a long time but I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it . Do you by any chance ? Oh , yes . You do ! Yes , very much . Well , would n't you know . As a matter of fact , I prefer public television . Uh-huh . And , uh , I have , particularly enjoy the English comedies , Yeah , and the English mysteries . Yeah , I watch mysteries too . Is that what you 're referring to ? Yes . Okay , yeah . That is good . I like , uh , do you read ? Vociferously . Okay , well that 's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they 're kind of based on books . Yes . And , the plots are more , um , challenging , you know , than the sitcoms of regular T V . Well , unfortunately for us at least here in the United States , we , the only access we have to that of course is public television . Yeah .
