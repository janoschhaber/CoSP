She has a , a child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted , and because of the cutbacks in the economy -- Right . -- they have nothing for her . Oh , no . And , and to me that 's the same thing . It 's , it 's like having a child who has a learning disability that 's being ignored , Uh-huh , uh-huh . this poor gifted child is being ignored . Right , but that 's something that parents , I think , are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child . That 's true . So , because , That 's true . that 's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home -- Uh-huh . -- but learning disability , unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that , then it makes it real difficult -- Uh-huh . -- and this is , this to me is the benefit I see in public schools -- Yes . -- is that , that , uh , you do have government money to fund , Right . the kinds of programs -- Right . -- that these students need , and I 'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem , they test kids before they take them , Exactly , and , and if they 're a behavior problem , they 're out .
