Well , Julie , uh , are you in a situation where you 'd soon need to deal with , uh , special care for elderly ? Well , I do n't know . My grandfather is ninety-two years old . Uh-huh . And he is still living by himself . My grandmother died a couple of years ago . But he does n't want to , to move away . He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm . Uh-huh . And he recently had to have an operation but he just really does n't want to go to a nursing home . Is he able to , uh , still do everything himself pretty well ? Well , he was until this operation . He has arthritis . Oh , yeah . And now I do n't really think he 's doing that well . And my , a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him . And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot . Yeah . But , uh , my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three . Uh-huh . And , uh , died six weeks after they put him in the home . Yeah . And I 'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f- , grandfather 's feelings . Because , uh , I th , you know , I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of , do they still have some of their life left . And -- Uh-huh . -- and , for , for , I 'm sure , a lot of people going into a nursing home it 's like saying my life is over and I 'm just here for the rest of the stay . And so I , you know , I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home , it 's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs . Yeah -- Uh-huh .
