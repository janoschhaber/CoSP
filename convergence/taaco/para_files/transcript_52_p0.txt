I was trying to think about some of my favorite people that I liked in music and they 're , none of them are recent , right . Uh-huh . So I like Gordon Lightfoot , do you know who he is ? Yeah . And the Moody Blues , and I like to listen to piano music a whole lot , and Willie Nelson . Uh-huh . So you like a , a variety . Yeah . Sort of easy listening because you like country but then , But not all country . I do n't like that , Um . when they start , I do n't know . I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he 's such a character . Oh , uh-huh . Yeah , I , I like some of his songs , though . They 're , they 're not so , they 're not so sad country all the time . They 're just kind of sweet sometimes . Yeah . You know , I mean they 're not the , the typical country where they 're just , you know , my wife left me , my dog left me , you know . My truck is broken down . Yeah , my truck 's broken down and my house just burned down , you know . Yeah . But , There , there 's a guy , have you ever heard of George Winston , he plays piano . No .
