Put in a perennial blue salvia . Now it is going to grow about , um , the plant itself will grow about eighteen inches tall . Uh-huh . And it will send out a flower spike . You will see them blooming now . It is a wildflower here , but you can get them in the nursery . I am looking for a pen . I want to write this down because , well , that is where I went this year . Because I waited too late to really plant stuff . But I did not know that these hyacinths , like I said , I do not know anything about plants . I did not know the hya- , hyacinths were going to die . Yep . Well , the , you know , e- , nursery men will se , will sell you things here . And they are , they are kind of in a labor of love . The other thing to do if you , re- , really like the hyacinths , and I do , is that before you plant those bulbs , stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them . Yeah . That is what I did with my plants . I had bought these , uh , colossians -- Yep .
