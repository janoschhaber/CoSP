His mother 's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago , and I said , well let 's start this letter , and it just never MUMBLEx my husband 's sisters started it and sent it to us and that 's as far as it got . I sent it , Yeah . on to the next one , and , and , but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one , in Scottsdale , Arizona , Uh-huh . for that family . We are real glad we got together because since that , that time there were only like two of the , one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left . And the sister-in-law died and the sister is in a nursing home , so , we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago .
