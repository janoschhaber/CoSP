What kind of painting are you planning to do ? Well I have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting . Uh-huh . And , um , it 's a rent house and I decided it 's too expensive to rewallpaper so I decided I 'm going to paint . Uh-huh . And I 've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint . And I 'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them . Oh , what would be interesting . Either that or maybe rag rolling .
