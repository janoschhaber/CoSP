because , uh , we 're just having conversation on this , uh , with a couple of people yesterday . And I was expressing my frustrations that , uh , some of the , so many problems , I work in a high school , are that kids do n't have a , a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large . Uh , and you ca n't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract , uh , sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home . Right . Um , and , it 's seen more so because when you call parents up , many parents wo n't even recognize that there is a problem and I 'll say , they 'll say , oh , well , our kids , my kid , I 've never heard anything about this before . This is the first time there have been problems . And , and , you wonder , do n't these parents know that teachers talk , and , you know , we do check with other teachers , and other teachers find the same things in -- Right .
