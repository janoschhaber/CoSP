So have you done any painting projects lately ? Yeah , this is a great topic for me , because I just did my first two painting projects ever . Oh , really ? Was not , not a big deal -- What kind of -- -- two little deals , -- painting was it ? The first one , um , I helped someone repaint an apartment , and it was very easy . Uh-huh , it , was it ? Yeah , and I 've never painted anyth- , I always thought it would be , so , you know , you 'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something -- Yeah , -- but I know I can do it . Oh , uh-huh . And the second one was I bought some toys at a , um , at a craft fair . Uh-huh . They 're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for Christmas , and so I decided to paint them ,
