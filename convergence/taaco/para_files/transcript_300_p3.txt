this makes me angry . This is something that ought to be in the schools -- Oh my goodness . -- rather than some of the other stuff they do . And with our budget cuts , I 'm sure -- Yeah . -- that 's not going to not going to change anytime soon . Well that 's the only way they 're . Yeah , well , that 's the only way they 're going to be able to do it . And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that . Oh my goodness . So , in some ways I think the , the day schools do serve those purposes . Yeah . That 's true . Well even the preschools , you know they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten , you know , it 's like wham . Yeah . Yeah . Culture shock . It 's just , Put the colors away . Yeah , yeah . Get the computers out -- Which is too bad . -- and , you know . Uh-huh . That 's hard . Uh-huh . It 's so difficult for them . Um , did you have your children , did you say in home , in , in , private care , was that in your home or in someone else 's home ? Until they were two . Yeah . Yeah , both times they were at our house . Uh-huh . So you were able to have somebody come there . And that was hard too . I , I lucked out with really good people both times but I know so many people that are never able to find that and I 'd practically give my paycheck away to do it , so . Yeah . Yeah . Did you have a nanny or did you have someone -- Yeah . -- that lived in with you ? Well no , she did n't live with us . Uh , the first one was an , elderly lady who was putting a , a daughter through nursing school -- Oh . -- just purely on baby-sitting money . Oh my goodness . And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night . Uh-huh .
