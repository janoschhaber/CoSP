You can actually buy a whole brand new computer with a not not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars . You 're kidding . No . Including a printer ? Well , actually I was n't including a printer , but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars so make it seven hundred . A hundred ? Yeah . Wholly smoke , a respectable one ? Yes , uh-huh . Well , see of not being particularly interested I do n't keep track of prices on them , but I 'm , I 'm , that does amaze me . Yeah , the prices had plummeted , you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply , Uh-huh . the box and the mother board of a type of computer called an eighty , eighty-eight , for about two hundred dollars . Huh . And then the keyboard is another fifty , the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred and then the disk drive is two fifty . Well , what , what is a a good brand a inexpensive . Well , that 's that 's the deal is you 're not buying brands now , you 're buying these knock offs , so there 's , probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there 's a magazine called COMPUTER SHOPPER . Uh-huh . It 's a big magazine , it 's twelve inches acro- , narrow , the narrow side and -- Oh , wow . -- seventeen inches the tall side and it 's probably an inch thick a thousand pages . But the book is , the magazine is full of these mail order , computer mail-order houses and they 're all competing with each . Uh-huh . So you just flip through there until you find a eighty , eighty-eight computer that that 's called , it 's the original P C . So it 's , we call the T I , I 'm sorry an I B M P C compatible . And you 'll find all these things and you 'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me . Uh . And you mix and match and then you do it by mail-order .
