Well , hi . I guess , uh , I 'll just start by saying that we entertain with , uh , a gourmet club here . Um , which means that we have like eight , eight people , four couples . Uh-huh . And most of the husbands , this is really peculiar , most of the husbands cook . Great . I mean , the wives during the day , you know , get , I guess , so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day . Um , you know they do n't really care about gourmet stuff , but it was the guys that got together and did all this . Oh , that 's nice . And , um , like my husband just , he really , really likes to cook in terms of , um , oh , barbecue , and I mean all guys , I think , like to barbecue . I think it 's caveman , Right , right .
