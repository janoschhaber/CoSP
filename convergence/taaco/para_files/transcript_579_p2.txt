-- those types of things . And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in , uh , finding a ca- , car anymore that 's , that 's fairly easy for me to work on , it 's just not very eas , it 's not very , almost unlikely at this point . Yeah . And , uh , yo- , Yeah . I 've got a sixty-five Mustang and -- Ooh . -- I , and I do the work on , most of the work on that myself . Uh-huh . And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that , I just say I will never do that with the modern cars . It 's not worth my time . You ca n't get in there . You ca n't do anything . Yeah . And it 's so complicated too . I look at it and I say , boy , you know , I , I 'd have to almost go take a class or something like that . Well I 've got an eighty-three Saab . Uh-huh . And I find that for a normal , you know , everyday things . It 's really very easy to work on and so , uh , you know , I 'm kind of spoiled . I used to have a MUMBLEx Chevy . Uh-huh . With a three fifty in it . Yeah . And , uh , I really liked working on it . Uh , cause it was pretty easy too . It was about a nineteen seventy . So I 'm kind of , uh , biased in that and , you know , I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore . Yeah . And that 's kind of , that 's , that 's probably one thing I 'd look at .
