Okay . Do you have any children ? No . I do n't . You do n't . Do you ? Yes , I have , uh , one . A five year old daughter . Uh-huh . Did you ever have her in child care ? Yes , I do . She was , um , at a private , well , I stayed off work with her for little over of a year -- Uh-huh . -- when she was born . And then I had her at a private sitter for , I guess , two , two and a half years after that . And how did you choose that sitter ? Um , she was referred to me by a couple of people and she turned out to be wonderful . I could n't have asked for anything better , I do n't think . Yeah . I did n't want to s , send her straight to a day care . Right . And , even though she was that old , I still did n't want her to go to a day care . Yeah . And this lady , you would think it was her own . Really ? Yeah . She 's real good . It 's hard to find people like that . Yes . It is . And , um , now I have got her in a Montessori school . Uh-huh . And she 's really , really doing good and learning a lot . And , actually , I 've started working up there in the afternoons , too . So , Oh , yeah . Well , that 's neat . Y- , well , yeah . I guess . I 'm going to quit as soon as school , the school season 's over . But , uh , I really enjoyed being with her up there . I hate it for her , she has to stay that much longer , Yeah . but , Do they have classes for them during the summer , too ? Yeah . They , they go f- , uh , year-round , uh -- Huh . -- teach them . Now , in the summer they have like a lot of field trips .
