No , I do n't think . I think we 're going the opposite direction . It 's the parochial schools that I guess many ti- , they 've had uniforms for years , I r- , do n't really know if they still do . Well , some of them , yes they do and , and it 's not -- It certainly makes it easier to dress . -- at some of the private schools , but even there 's a couple public schools in Dallas where , where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers , you know , dress -- Uh-huh . -- in accordance with that . Well , it 's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run , I think , that you do n't have to be concerned about your wardrobe . Uh-huh . Well I , I think it would make a difference at school . I , I do n't think we should be spending time saying somebody 's wearing torn clothing or wearing sh- , too shorts , too short or they 've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high , you know , I mean -- Uh-huh . -- it 's a lot of trouble to , to take care of that . And , of course , the kids say , then why bother , just let me wear what I want . And , and yet we ca n't to that either . I 'd like to see them go to , to not necessarily a uniform , but saying that they 've got to wear a button down shirt . You know , that would , that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them . But if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted and , Yeah , but I doubt that that would come ab- , -- And then the girls , -- that that will come about . Just , Right . Yeah , I , I , I do n't , no , not in Plano . No not , They may get a- , -- Yeah .
