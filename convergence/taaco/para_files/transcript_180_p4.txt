Huh , that 's really funny . But , I never think about it until after you go there for about a week , your toes , you start getting blisters anyway . So no big deal . Huh , that 's , But it 's fun . So , how often do find yourself going ? Um , on a , if you 're doing it on a regular basis , how often do you go ? I try to make it at least three times a week . Yeah . That 's really , For a while I was doing it every day . Just , Really ? going , uh , five days a week . I wish that I could make myself exercise every day . But I do force myself to do it at least three times a week . Which I do n't feel like is enough , but i- , it 's , it 's at least something . You know , it , it , I just force , I have to force myself to do it , like I said , because to me , I really do n't enjoy it . But I know that I have to do it . I mean it 's just , it 's , it 's not a question of whether I want to , you know . Well , But , When I was working up at , uh , The Summit , Uh-huh . here in Plano , I 'd leave there , and I 'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock . Oh , that 's , Oh , actually about four thirty because they start at five to six , so I was there by four thirty , every night . And the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet . Uh-huh . Because no matter what I did or how I did it , I invariably got myself wet . Uh-huh . But the water only comes up basically to your , anywhere from your waist to your , oh , chest , I 'd say . Yeah . So I mean , it 's your choice where you want to go , but , Did you ever , I enjoyed it higher . Well , I 'm sorry . That 's okay .
