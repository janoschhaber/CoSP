Uh , I used to live in the Plano school district , and , uh , there was a , an organization , a taxpayers organization that , uh , finally communicated the message to the , I think to the people in Plano that , you know , we did n't want our taxes raised . Yes , I remember there was about four , five years ago . Yeah . Yes . But , this , you know , this , uh , I think living in Richardson , we 're kind of spoiled because I think we get , we come closer to getting our money 's worth as far as the city is concerned , I think than probably any , any city in the country . Yes , well , did you read in the Dallas paper where they increased the teach- , the administrators ' pay by thirty three percent -- Is that incredible ? -- after they laid off all those teachers . That 's , that 's the biggest mess I 've ever heard of . You know , how can you , how can you justify raising anybody 's salary if you , you know , if you have to lay people off ? Right . But , you know , I 'm not going to complain because Plano got , we all got a pay raise this year . Yeah . You all got a pay raise this year . Yeah .
