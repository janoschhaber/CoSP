 I know . Well , what I did was I went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas , and long story short , I had n't , this is really a stupid thing that happened , but they have like the gymnasium flooring and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where I usually stand -- Uh-huh . -- in any class like that I go to . Instead of having that level , you know -- Uh-huh . -- they had a chrome strip that was n't level , and it was about four inches deep and then about , oh a seventy degree angle . Oh , my goodness . And as we were jumping around or doing something I just jumped up and came right down on it . Um . The orthopedist called it a , uh , basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you , and it snapped . Woo . I know . We went to MUMBLEx , well whatever in Plano , and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show . And the doctor said , you did n't do anything . There 's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you .
