There 's seven children in my husband 's family and fortunately four of them live in the same home town and she has Alzheimer 's . It was getting where she was getting th- , dangerous . I mean -- Uh-huh . -- letting strangers in and things like this , but they were very fortunate . It 's a small town and she happens to room with one of the doctor 's mothers and -- Oh , well that 's good . -- then she 's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time but she really does n't . Nobody thought she would adjust , but she has adjusted beautifully . Oh , that is great .
