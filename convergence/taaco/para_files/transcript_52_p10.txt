I got a degree from T W U , but I 'm really interested in legal , you know , in the legal environment , but I do n't want to be a lawyer so I said well , I think I 'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant . That 'd probably be pretty interesting . I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week . They had summonsed eight hundred people , about four hundred showed up , and it was for a murder trial . Oh , uh-huh . This guy had supposedly , uh , strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose . Anyway , this is happened in nineteen eighty-three . Yeah . And they had us fill out a long questionnaire . We stayed till about one thirty and they 're going to call the ones that they 're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial wo n't take place until June . Yeah , that 's how it works . And they say it 's going to last about two to three weeks . And this guy in front of me said , I ca n't believe I was summonsed . I was an investigator and I was tailing the woman that was killed . Well , then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that 's a lawyer and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that 's accused was the one that actually did it . And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been , uh , getting cocaine from his client and then selling it , and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he 's going to testify for the State against her so he 'll have his sentence reduced . And this is the man that was in front of you ? Yeah . Oh , well they 'll , The , weed him out . the investigator . Yeah ,
