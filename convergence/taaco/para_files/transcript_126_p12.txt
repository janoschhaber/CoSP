I 've been there like , maybe a dozen times . Uh-huh . But I actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to . Uh-huh . It 's terrible . I do n't know if the Dallas location , it just seems that , um , sometimes I feel like I 'm in a singles bar . Yeah , yeah , that 's true . And I have n't noticed that up at Spring Creek . No , I have n't either , and I just , uh , it 's not that far of a drive and I 'm glad they did that . Um , you 're not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site . It 's not -- Yeah . -- at all anything worth talking about . Yeah . I thought maybe one of these days I 'll drive over there and check it out . Yeah , but if you do n't live near there that 's not worth , Yeah . I live in Richardson , but it 's about half way between the Spring Creek and the , the Dallas site . Yeah . That 's actually where this happened to me , out in , I say Plano , but it 's all the same to me . Richardson , over on Campbell and Park Hill there 's a new recreation center . Uh-huh . And as we were doing it , too , everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities . MUMBLEx walked out , I was one thing , oh great , I have purple tights on , you know .
