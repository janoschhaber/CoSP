so I guess if there was a national curriculum we 'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn . Right . But , uh . We actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes , you know . Um . That 's , that 's pretty low that there 's -- Yeah . -- forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more peop- , more citizens percentage wise that can read and write , so , um , unless we want to keep paying , paying for these people that ca n't make it in society , we 're going to have to do something . I do n't know . Obviously nobody 's smart enough to have figured it out yet , so I probably ca n't . But I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five , six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write -- -- because they ca n't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays -- Right . -- you know . Uh , you ca n't , you ca n't even work an answering machine if you 're at work and had to get a message or something , you know , or fill out an application to work at McDonalds if you ca n't read . Uh-huh . So , uh , I think that 's , that 's a start at least , going back to the basics in the early grades -- -- and , um , they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago , and that 's a big jump . Yeah I believe that . Did you go to school in Plano ? I did .
