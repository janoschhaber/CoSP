we have a , a family called All day family . They were all murdered . Uh-huh . All the people signed confessions , they went to a trial by jury . They been trying these people now for twenty-two years , ever since I was a child . Wow . And what they 've done is they 've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they 've done , has nothing to do with justice whatsoever . Well , you know , it 's , it 's one of those things , I mean , uh , uh , I would have to look at it . I- , if they did it with the , uh , just the judges , the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day , they know all the procedures , they know what 's good and what is n't , they 'd be able to say , I 'm sorry , you ca n't use this as , uh , evidence , you know , because it was either illegally obtained or whatever and , you know , you would n't have this , uh , uh , theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the , to the jury and then the judge says , oh , no , d , disregard that . Come on , any jury 's not going to disregard the evidence , you know . Uh , that 's true . I , I , I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself . That may very well be . I , I hold it in the utmost contempt . Uh , The , uh , d- , my favorite is the police department ,
