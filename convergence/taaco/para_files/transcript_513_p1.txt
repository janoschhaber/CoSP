-- and I suppose that 's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution , perhaps somewhat even with the business , uh . But I agree , you know , the , uh , medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the , uh , security aspect for long term employment , uh , Well , you know that 's interesting though . Because I do n't know if that 's necessarily the case anymore . I use to think that , you know , after you work , you mean security , job security ? Job security , yes . Uh , that use to be I think a couple of years ago , but I do n't know if it is so much anymore . In fact , they , we just had a lay off in what November , I guess . Uh-huh . But , uh , it was n't necessarily , I mean , you know , some people had been there a long time . Yeah , we are seeing that here as well . Like in some of the large oil companies . There has been massive lay offs . Uh-huh . Uh , so I , I think there it 's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world -- Uh-huh . -- in , uh , institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses , we need to cut back , that 's what we do . Uh-huh . No doubt -- But , -- yeah .
