Wendy , I guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if , uh , if that may be the case -- Right . -- and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that , uh , let me ask you the question , do you have a , uh , budget , or a monthly budget , or a long term budget that you stick to ? Right now I 'm in college and I 'm on work study -- Uh-huh . -- and so my budget comes from my dad 's help . Uh-huh . He helps me out a lot and I get paid monthly , so that 's kind of hard to have a budget . My mother , uh , does n't get paid much money , so her budget is , uh , just , uh , planning for I R A 's . I see , I see . Well , good , I 'm kind of in a different situation , but I , I , I went through that , too , when I was in school , but , uh , I was , I was working to get through college and , and , uh , trying to make it through that , but , uh , I 'm married and have , uh , a , a couple of children and -- Uh-huh . -- we have to , uh , pretty much stick to a budget . I 'm on a salary so I do n't get any overtime or anything like that but , Oh . We have a fixed income and we have to make sure that , uh , every dollar we have will , is spent accordingly and , uh , what we try and do to , to stick to our monthly budget is -- Uh-huh . -- we pretty much have , you know , the house payment , we have the insurance premiums , uh , utilities and so forth and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we 're going to spend and set that money aside , and we also try and set aside money for savings , set aside money for the coll- , the kids ' education -- Uh-huh . -- college education , the future and , uh , set aside money for bonds and , and we also set aside an emergency fund because -- That sounds good . -- we 've , uh , we 've been married for about ten years
