That 's super . I have n't learned to hit the ball easy and I just sort of , I 'm always wanting to hit it hard and , that 's something my stepfather never could teach me , you know , just to relax and hit the ball , and , you know , so , subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve , fourteen holes , my , you know , a lot of my energy 's gone , when I do swing it 's an easier swing -- Uh-huh . -- and I do , actually , hit the ball better . Uh-huh . Have you ever , have you ever tried a one iron ? No , I have a two through , you know , two through wedge . I hit a two iron awful lot . Off , now , off the tee . Uh-huh . I do n't hit a driver off the tee . That , that 's why I need my driving lessons . Well , you know , I put mine back in my bag this year , too , and I , I used a three wood rather than a driver . That helps . Uh , I had a lot more control on it , uh , I sacrificed distance , but I was n't in trouble every time I got down the fairway . Well , that 's , that 's a good idea . I think this next year , I 'm going to , I 'm going to attempt to play more and I 'm going to do the same thing . I , I laid off my woods about three years ago and I just use a two wood off the fairway and I 'm a fairly strong person so I get a pretty good little drive -- Uh-huh . -- and I , and I guess control my irons , better , you know , if you 'll take lessons , the first thing they put in your hand is an iron . Oh , yeah , absolutely . And , uh , I still remember that watching myself and my son so , but I think the key is you just need to , you need to play more often than I play . Yeah , well , I , I read recently here , they say , if you 're playing , if you 're scoring well , you should play more . If you 're scoring poorly , you should spend more time on the practice g- , -- Right . -- uh , range . Uh , I think there is less flus- , frustration factor there , too , uh , Makes good , makes good sense .
