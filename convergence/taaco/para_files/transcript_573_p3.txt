but you know , it 's , I , I do n't have time . I used to read TIME magazine a lot , but I do n't read it much anymore . Yeah , that 's , that 's kind of a problem for them . There 's a lot of people who fall into that , category . And then we have a local rag here in town that -- Uh-huh . -- I pick up periodically and read just to see what 's going on in our little community . I see . Because we do n't get an awful lot of coverage in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS . Yeah , the big dailies do n't like to , do n't like to step much out of their , uh , out of their home turf , I have to admit , the TIMES is kind of provincial , too . It 's basically anything that 's south of downtown , they do n't bother to cover . Now , they have started here running a three day , or three times a week Plano section . Uh-huh . And it 's just sort of a , you know , four or five pages that covers what 's going on in Plano . But it 's still not an awful lot of news . Yeah , I know . I , uh , it was , it was a big discovery when , when the TIMES , when the TIMES found out there was a place called Orange County .
