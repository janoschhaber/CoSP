Well , I know I 'm in the , you know , the only reason I asked about secondary schools or , you know , advanced education is because down here , you know , going to the University of Texas , the education I 'm getting I think is kind of shoddy for a public school . Is it ? I , I do n't think I 'm getting what I should , but , you know , in Texas , it 's next to free because th- , they pay so much of it . It 's state supported . Well that , But at the same time it 's really not , it 's not like going to M I T . My engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of M I T . And that 's , it 's really too bad -- Well , -- but that 's , I do n't know , I think it just builds on the foundation that they 've already built . You get people out of high schools and col- , junior colleges that do n't have the background for an M I T kind of curriculum . So , So you have to go to a lesser engineering school . We have a very good public school up here
