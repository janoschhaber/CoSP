Uh , but I do have friends that live in the city and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing . Uh , just because there are , like , crack houses , you know , on their street and stuff like this . Uh-huh . Do you live in a real small town or , or out in the country ? I live out in the country , yeah . How far out from the city , I mean , do you , I 'm about fifteen miles out . About fifteen miles . I live in a little suburb , uh , which is , I guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so -- Uh-huh . -- but it 's pretty congested . We are considered in the country , Um . but it does n't really feel like you 're in the country . Um . Our major crimes in our immediate town , uh , is probably robberies , house robberies -- Uh-huh . -- and very few instances of , you know , alcohol , drugs , uh , reported . However , I 'm sure they 're there . Uh-huh . But , uh , right now our neighborhood is running about , uh , eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed , Wow . sometime during their , their , uh , existence in that neighborhood . That 's huge . And since that time everybody 's got some sort of burglar system or , you know , uh , burglar alarms -- Uh-huh . -- uh , and including the out , uh , the outer perimeter type , uh , devices , Uh-huh . sensors and things like that . It 's cut back , you know , considerably , but it , it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood , so it still , uh , remains city wide , pretty , pretty high . Are there , are there any theories on why this is happening ? Uh , I would say the majority of it 's happening during the day , uh , between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon . Uh-huh . Most , But why ? Why is it happening ? Well , most families , most families are young and both people are working . Uh-huh . So they 're happening during the hours they 're gone from work . Uh-huh . Uh , so , uh , I would say that 's probably their prime motivation .
