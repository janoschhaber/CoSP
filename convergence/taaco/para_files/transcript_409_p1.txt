I 'll go ahead and start the way I work , uh , the way I dress -- Uh-huh . -- for work is , uh , this year , nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie , or I should n't say suit , but coat and tie every day . Uh-huh . A , a year ago , I changed jobs from being a researcher -- Uh-huh . -- to doing marketing for the research group . Uh-huh . Which means kind of a , I guess it 's a different set of standards , I guess . Yeah . So , uh , I , I dress almost the same every day . I mean , pretty much it 's a white shirt and -- Uh-huh . -- slacks and shoes and -- Uh-huh . -- a coat . But , it was very different before . How do you dress ?
