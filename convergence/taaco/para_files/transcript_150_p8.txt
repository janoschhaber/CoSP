the old church . Yeah . Yeah . Which it 's not that way now but I think that there is , just that , I think that it 's just Latin countries are slower in coming around . Well , they actually understood , it is in America where it was hard Latin , you know -- Well , Latin , -- is very , very , very close to Spanish . Uh , they still did n't understand it though , I do n't think , Yeah . because I , I descend from that . And I , you know , I do n't , ca n't , I do n't understand Latin -- Uh . -- and I 'm of Spanish descent . So , Yeah . um , I , I just think that has something to do with why Latinos or , tend to be , you know , the mee , the more meek , you know , they tend to be more , like not stand up for their rights as much . They 're not really sure of what they are . I do n't think . Uh , I never really thought of , Well , I mean , how , it that way . can you contrast the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights to , to say the people in Latin America . I mean , why are they , why are they not as vocal or why do they not , you know , stand up , so to speak , for their rights ? I do n't know , could be the , the economic still . You know , the , there 's , the poverty level is certainly , uh , you know , much worse in the Latin American countries . I mean , you can say that about Africa too .
