You had to fill out an application and , Uh-huh . go down to the sheriff 's office and get fingerprinted and , Gee . then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing . Gee , that 's not a bad idea . No , I think that , uh , you know , a , a waiting period , uh , Yeah . can make a difference but again it 's going to be the law abiding citizen that 's going to comply with that . Yeah , yeah it is . So there 's , I do n't , No . think there 's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because , Th- , the only way they could do it I think , would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun .
