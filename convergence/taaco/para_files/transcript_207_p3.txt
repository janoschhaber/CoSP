It 's not too strenuous , and I could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything , but I do n't know what I did to my knee . I was crawling under a desk , hooking up a computer . Uh-huh . And I mashed it wrong , or I did something . Oh , gosh . And the doctor has had me on medication , and she does n't want me to walk , she said , that 's you know , while it 's healing , you 're going to mess it up , so I ca n't walk . Wow . And uh , she said , you know , the most conservative approach , you do the medicine , you do the medicine again and again , before you think of surgery . Uh-huh . And I do n't want her to think of surgery on my knee . I do n't want anyone to think about that , ever . No , that , that 's a tough situation .
