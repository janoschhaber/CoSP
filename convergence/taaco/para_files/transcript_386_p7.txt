I live right on a main thoroughfare , so when I first moved here I probably did consider that an invasion of privacy because it , at first you 'd hear a lot of noise , especially at night -- Uh-huh . -- you know , when you go to bed . Oh , yeah . And every time a , a fire truck or anything went down the road , I would wake up , but I guess I have gotten used to it because I do n't even hear it anymore . Oh , yeah , I suppose you do . And , uh , I just close it out , I guess , because I do n't , I do n't remember waking up in several years at night when I 'd hear a fire truck go by , you know . Uh-huh . Yeah . I think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me . Yeah . I am a real solid sleeper though so that probably would n't bother me . I 'd sleep right through it . They would have to chop down the door and get you out , I guess . . Yeah . It takes a lot . Let 's see . What else is an invasion ? I had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time . Oh . I was mad because those were mine MUMBLEx , Well , did you have has name all over them ? No . It was a , a letter from a girlfriend of mine . I , I just , I was upset because those were mine , and , you know , I thought he , That was yours . Yeah . Right . I thought he would respect me more than that , Yeah . to look through my things and not trust me , so that was upsetting . I was mad about that and my privacy there . Yeah .
