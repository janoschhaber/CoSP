but our neighbor decided he did n't like cats and shot one of them . Oh no . Oh well he lived through it , oh , I could n't believe it . We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills . Oh my gosh . The , the cat almost died , and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat , oh he loves life now . Oh , I imagine . And he 's like oh , thank you so much . I wonder how many of his lives he missed , when that happened . I know , we wondered about that . But , uh , oh that was a traumatic experience for us too . Oh , I can imagine , what did he shoot him with . Uh , well , uh , from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip . Oh my gosh . People are crazy . Oh yes , absolutely nuts . But , uh , luckily enough , you know , we found the cat in time and , uh , rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery and , Oh Lord . tod- , I mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him . Oh man . But oh , he 's been a wonderful cat . I imagine . They usually are after something like that happens to them . It seems to mellow them or something . Oh yes .
