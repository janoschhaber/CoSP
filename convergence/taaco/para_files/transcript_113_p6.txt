I , I watched that game and , uh , that was , uh , Do you have a favorite between those two ? Well , because I 'm right here in Dallas I , I kind of pull for Dallas . Really ? . Yeah . Well , also Houston is , uh , in Pittsburgh 's division so , Well , that 's true . I 'll almost always root against them . MUMBLEx . I hate to say it but I hate Dallas . That 's okay . Well I , you know , I , I was never really a big Dallas fan -- Yeah . -- until we moved here and they just kind of grew on me . Yeah , I imagine . That 's the way , I 've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two and they , they 've actually started doing something . Yeah . Yeah . So , I 've actually pl- , paid attention to them .

Um , what cities are they looking at ? Uh , right now I think this Memphis , they 're , they 're trying to get the teams . Uh-huh . And that 's , that 's where I was when I saw , uh , Uh-huh . Houston play . Saint Louis is trying to get a team . Uh , Baltimore is trying to get a team , and there 's some other city . I 'm wanting to say Raleigh Durham but I 'm not sure . You know , I think you are right . I think it is Raleigh . Think so ? I think I remember hearing that . Uh-huh . Because I know they 've got a MUMBLEx football team but I think it might be them . That would be fun . I 'd like to see some more teams get in . I would , definitely . I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after . And right now I think Memphis and , it 's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it . Uh-huh . Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did . Oh , really ? Yeah . It 's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two ,
