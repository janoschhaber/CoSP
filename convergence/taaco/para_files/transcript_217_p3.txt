this . Okay . Well , can you tell me anything else about the house . Are you working on it ? I mean , do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation ? Yeah . This entire neighborhood , everybody keeps the places up real nice . Yeah . That 's , that 's nice . Yeah , the town that I came from is , uh , is a , uh , older town , it like , the typical , the typical homes there are like , you know , early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds , Wow . and I renovated a house there and that was so much fun . I mean , there , if you do n't live in a house that 's at least seventy-five to hundred years old , you know , you 're just nobody , practically . And that was really , that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline and , uh , MUMBLEx was considered typical for that area . So , uh , it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that 's just , you know , a very square little box and , you know , there 's not a whole lot you can do with it . But , uh , anyway , Living in the city has some advantages . Yeah .
