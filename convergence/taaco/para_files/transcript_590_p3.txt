Uh , I 've , the high school I went to was , uh , was a good one also . And I , well , I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools . Because the one I went to was , you know , I 'm sure a , a lot nicer than , you know , a lot of the inner city schools and -- Yeah . -- the things around Atlanta . Yeah . It was a , a , it 's a more or less a suburban school system ? Yeah . Yes . That , that was true for mine too . Uh , although I I 'm sure to some extent , that money is part of the problem in the disparity , but I do n't think , I honestly do n't think that 's the biggest part of it . You know , I -- What d- , -- think that , uh , I mean I know that in my town , you know , most of the , most of the parents , they 're valued education . And , uh -- Yeah , that 's true . -- you know , and so the students were , you know , to some extent , motivated to learn . I mean -- Yeah . And I 'm also -- -- you know . -- I mean , in the , in those places where , uh , like the economy is really bad , they might , you know , be more tempted to , to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the , you know , money to put food on the table and stuff like that . More than they would , you know , in areas where they yeah , Yeah , that 's true . But , but , uh , I think , I mean even more than that , even , I mean if you drop out in high school -- Uh-huh . -- you should still be able to read , you know ? Yeah . That 's true . Which it MUMBLEx , I mean it sounds like , uh , now I think maybe it 's started changing in the past few years because , uh , they have of these , uh , sort of mandatory , -tory tests if you have to take before you get -- Right . -- a diploma . But , uh , but , uh , certainly before that , there were people that , you know , would graduate from high school and could barely read . Uh , and that 's just sort of inexcusable and you ca n't really ,
