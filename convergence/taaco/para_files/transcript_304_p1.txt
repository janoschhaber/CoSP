Well , uh , it 's funny , when I tried , to make the call the other days , I thought , I had n't seen anything since DANCES WITH WOLVES but today I went to see REGARDING WITH HENRY . Oh , I 'm dying to see that . It was really good . We -- Oh . -- uh , Jeff Wariner just got out of the hospital -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , Jeff and Deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood , and , uh , we all liked it . We had both moms and , uh , fifteen year olds and a twelve year old and -- Oh , my goodness . -- everyone enjoyed it . And , uh , Oh , well I am just dying to see it . I went to dinner with some friends last weekend and they said get a baby-sitter and we 'll all go see REGARDING HENRY -- Yeah . -- and I said , ooh , I want to see it so bad . Well , my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer , on , choir tour and -- Oh . -- visiting friends and one thing and another . A lot of the ones I had wanted to see and so since he had this friend up from Houston , uh , and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I thought well , I want to see this one , too . So , we , uh , Yeah . I finally , it 's my first summer movie . Oh my . Well , let me see .
