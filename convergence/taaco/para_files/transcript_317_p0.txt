Do you have any hobbies ? Yes , I do . What are yours ? China painting and ceramics . Ooh , how great . I enjoy it . Uh-huh . Oh , uh , ceramic painting . I enjoy the china more . The china more . And now that I have my eyes , corrected to the point that I can see the delicate part of china painting , I do enjoy it . How did you ever get into that ? That sounds so interesting . My husband kept begging me , and he 's been dead now for twenty years , so you understand that this was a long time ago . But he finally brought me the china , the book , the brushes and he said I have made arrangements for your lessons . How marvel , I , And I said I 'll do it for three months and if I do n't like it , that 's it . Well , I painted an awful lot until his death , which was several years . And it has just been the most relaxing , enjoyable , self-satisfying thing I 've had . I , Now , do you do it just for yourself , or do you do it to give as gifts , or do you actually sell it ? I have sold quite a bit . I give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home , and then I just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it . Uh-huh . Oh , that sounds mar- , now , do you work outside of the home ? I have just retired . You 've just retired . Yes . Oh , oh , what a great -- No , it 's not , -- hobby . I , It 's a great hobby , but do n't retire . Do n't retire . Oh , Well , see , I do n't , I never , uh , returned to work for the p- , I have stayed home for about the last nine years . Oh , have , well , We 've transferred around , and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake , uh , on Lake Erie .
