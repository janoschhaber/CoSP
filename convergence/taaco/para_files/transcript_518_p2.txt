-- and I can understand them wanting to have them , but then again it 's just like all those nuts out there . Well , you know , uh , uh , no- , if you are looking at like you know country that , uh , where they do have a lot more gun control , like England and places like that , you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much . It has ? Because then , Well I mean yeah . The , uh , the in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States . Um . Uh , you know , I mean , the problem though , you know , they , if the , since the United States had this , you know , pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think , you know , if you were introduced , you know , any controls , it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already . Yeah . You know , so it 's , it 's really kind of a complex problem . Well , is the crime that bad there in Atlanta ? Uh , I 'm not really sure how bad it is . I 've , I 've not really had that many problems with it , but I mean apparently we , we were ranked pretty high up . Yeah I know Dallas is . Uh . I mean , I think , you know , in the te- , I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years . I do n't know if Dallas is in the top three -- Uh-huh . -- but . Do you own a gun ? No . I 've thought about getting one . If I get one , I think I will probably , you know , get something . I probably would n't get a hand gun . I would probably get like a shotgun . Just for protecting myself . You know , from -- Uh-huh . -- burglar type thing . I do kind of live in the downtown area . Yeah . You know and shotguns are really good because they 're , I mean somebody is not going to break in , steal it , and you know , use it to mug someone , you know .
