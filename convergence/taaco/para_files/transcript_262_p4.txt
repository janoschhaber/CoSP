Yeah . and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days -- Yeah . -- and when land was cheap and , uh , construction costs were cheap , you could afford it . But now , And , digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive . Yeah , and the other thing is that when it , when it 's , the public transportation is established that early on then , then the business , uh , business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that . Absolutely . Whereas in , in , uh , in Dallas here we 've , we 've got , uh , those patterns were well established before , before we really tried to , tried to do the DART . And , uh , for instance all the , all the , the , uh , office buildings and stuff that are out here in , in , uh , north Dallas as opposed to downtown , uh , to try to , to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the , the metroplex to , to , uh , both those centers of , of business plus everything else that 's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area . Yeah . You know , like New York does , yeah . Yeah , just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere . Yeah . New York and some , Yeah . people do n't even own a car and know how to drive a car . Right , right . Someone made the analogy , uh , with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse . An old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street . Well , most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street . Yeah . And I 'm just as guilty as anyone else . Oh , yeah . Yeah . I drive to work every day by myself , uh , without even , even any thought of car pooling . Yeah , right . And , uh , most people are that way .
