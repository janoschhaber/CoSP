Okay . Uh , far as , you know , crime in the cities , I 'm sure , like in yours it 's pretty , pretty bad . Uh , probably the biggest thing we 've got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder -- Uh-huh . -- are the two top ones that we have . How about you ? Uh , well , I do n't actually live in the city , but I 'd probably say that 's roughly right . I mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life , but I , I think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff I 'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes , crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution , uh , and sale of drugs . Uh-huh . Prob- , probably right , if you look at it from that stand point . Uh-huh . What , uh , is there anything , uh , that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing ? Uh , where I live now it 's , it 's not so bad . I mean I can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it .
