now , the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny . Yeah . But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it 's gray . Well , yeah , but I 'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend . Oh , I go for that , yeah . Yeah . In fact , I 'm a little worried about this one coming up here . We have a long weekend and , it sounds like it 's going to be a little bit on the cool side .
