So . How 's your products been ? Um , I really have n't had , uh , too many problems . Uh , seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out . I hear that one . Have you had any lately go out ? Yeah , I 've had a dryer , an ice maker , a microwave , all three , and they , unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time , when I bought my new house , and , uh , I really do n't have any recourse , so I had to call and have them all repaired and that . Oh , wow . Yeah , it was a hassle . So you did n't get anything , even , all the , all the warranties were out ? Yeah , the warranty on the refrigerator , uh , the i- , the refrigerator warranty 's still good , but the ice maker itself , passed its three years , and it was three years and two months . You 're kidding . No . Yeah , we just moved into a new house , too ,
