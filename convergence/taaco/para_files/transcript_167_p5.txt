-- and they they check that name against , uh , their list and they find several . And without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all , they just report everything under that name . So you 've received a lot of , uh , flack ? They do n't , they do n't even check my Social Security number . Um . And companies are paying them good money to report accurately , and they 're not , they 're so lazy . They 're just not doing it . I mean they just find your name and they match it up . Uh-huh . You know , and that just drives me crazy because they 're , and then they want , then , you know , to get it removed they say , well , you know , you have to write this , write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them , you know , and then it takes three weeks and all . And I 'm like , baloney . Uh-huh . You messed it up , you fix it . Is that usually what you tell them in the letter ? No , what I 've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report -- Uh-huh . -- like , uh , uh , recently I was reported as having J C Penney accounts and I do n't . So I called J C Penney and I said , uh , I just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you 're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you 're providing to them . And they say , uh-huh , because they really do n't want to pay for a service that 's not being done properly either . Uh-huh . So then they can call the credit bureau and say , hey , you know , we 're paying you good money to report this properly and you 're not doing your job . Good idea .
