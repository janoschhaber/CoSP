I think , I , I think it should take , from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year . Yeah , i- , if that .

Well , yeah , I mean , the system is n't perfect , I mean , it 's run by a bunch of imperfect humans .

I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if , if there was a credible punishment , uh , for murderers . Um , yeah , I do n't know if it would or not though .

And society probably , too .
