this is just something on the side and , uh , the band I play in , we tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays . So I missed a lot of Sundays during -- Um . -- this , Did you ever get to watch any of the , uh , New Orleans games ? Ac- , I , I 'd have to confess I do n't really scope out the New Orleans games , per se . New Orleans just is n't , is n't one of the areas , I 've lived in so many places . I 've lived in , uh , Denver but I do n't like the Broncos . There 's , Um . no love for the Broncos . But , No . I 've lived in , uh , uh , I was born in Buffalo and I lived in , uh , outside of Boston for five years and then my family lives in Philadelphia now and , uh , so I tend to look for , uh , uh , Teams in your area . and I lived in Detroit , too . So I like , uh , first of all , first and foremost the Bills games I want to see . And then I 'll , uh , normally check out the Eagles or the Patriots and , Patriots were so depressing this last year that -- I know it . -- yeah , that , uh , Yeah . I kind of gave up on them . Yeah . But , uh , first and foremost the Bills . I even wen , I went to , got to go to a Bills game this year , which was fun .
