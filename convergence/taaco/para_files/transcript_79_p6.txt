And when you see , uh , Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the , uh , science jobs , all the engineering jobs , all the mathematical jobs and , you know , here we are we ca n't , we ca n't balance a checkbook without a calculator . Uh-huh . Um , I do n't know . Well , I spent a year and a half in Japan also and I 've seen how their school system works and I , they go by a complete rote system , you just memorize everything . Uh-huh . And then at the end of the , of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be . Yeah . So I do n't completely agree with that either . No . But there , there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere . Yeah . That 's , that 's a great deal what law school 's like . Oh , is it ? Yeah . Is that what you ended up going into ? Yeah . Oh . And , uh , I did the same sort of thing , they just , you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one examine for the whole semester -- Uh-huh . -- and it 's how well you can remember it all .
