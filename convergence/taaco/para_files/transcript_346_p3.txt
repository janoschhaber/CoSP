But , Well , it 's really fun . Um , one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis and a lot of them played it , and she started a group going in the neighborhood and my kids wanted to learn how to play it and it 's more fun with four people . Yeah , yeah . And it 's a game that none of their friends know how to play , and they both enjoy it . So if they want to play , they have to play with mom and dad . Yeah . So , uh , we play that a lot of them , and , uh , we like to go miniature golfing and to movies . Yeah . We have family that lives outside of the state so we go visit both sets of grandparents and , and take car trips .
