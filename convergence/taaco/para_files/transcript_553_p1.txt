Uh , I get kind of bored watching T V actually , when I watch the news on T V because -- I know , I do , I do , too . -- it goes so slow and , then there 's nothing that , you know , really is like oh , so exciting . Yeah , you may find one little , uh , news item interesting so you have to wait twenty minutes to , to hear about it . Yeah , that , that 's about what it ends up being . Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something . Yeah , actually , y- , you mention NEWSWEEK , I , I , I do like , uh , U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT . I do n't get to read it as much as I like , but that 's , I think that 's a good magazine . Yeah , I think they 're about the same . I , you know , they , they certainly have a very similar , uh , charter at least in my mind . And , uh , uh , what , what kind of , uh , what kind of news normally interests you , I mean what do you , what , what do you find interesting -- Well -- -- versus what do you find boring ? -- right now trying to keep abreast of , uh , what 's going on in Europe , you know , with all the , U S S R 's satellites breaking off , trying to become independent and , you know , European community coming together .
