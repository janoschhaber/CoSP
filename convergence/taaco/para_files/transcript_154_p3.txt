and , uh , had a lot of trouble with injuries , too . Yeah . You know , he 'd , uh , never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy . And then even like , uh , what is it , Eric Dickerson left , Uh-huh . the team , you know , tha- , you 're right . You know , like people were jumping ship right and left . Right . And , I do n't know , that sounds to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem , but then the team was sold . Yeah . So , But , uh , that Jimmy Johnson came in , too , though , and he just , you know , when he bought the team and all and it just seemed like he just decided , you know , this is the way it 's going to be and it was bad . Yeah . I mean , it really was . To me it was like it 's going to take them quite a while to rebuild because e- , everything , I mean anything that Tom Landry wanted or had , he was going to change it . Right . I mean it 's , tha- , I mean , you know , that 's the way I felt about it . But , Well , I tell you what , if New Orleans ever gets a quarterback -- Yeah . -- is n't nobody going to beat us . There ai n't nobody going to beat us then . Because look how good we did without a quarterback this year . I know . Who was the quarterback ? Well , See , I ca n't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback , They , is . had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it . Uh , Fourcade was for a while . And then , um , I ca n't remember that guy 's name , the one that held out for the money and he was across the river . Uh , I ca n't think of the , I ca n't think of his name now , but really we did n't have a quarterback . That , Yeah . was the whole problem . We had one guy that could n't throw and we had one guy that could n't run . Huh . And , it was , it was just bedlam . We really did n't have a quarterback .
