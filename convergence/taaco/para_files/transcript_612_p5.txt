Nobody talks about it so I do n't think we do . There 's no professional hockey teams in , in Texas MUMBLEx . No , uh-huh . And we have a soccer team that comes and goes . We do n't even have that very much , so . Yeah . I think though that professional football -- Uh-huh . -- in particular , is becoming so diluted now . Like they have this World Football League . You see , we have the N F L that , that Dallas -- Yeah . -- and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams . There are those teams that play in professional , National Football League but , uh , now they have what 's called the World Football League and they have all these teams from , there 's a team in London and there 's a team -- Oh . -- there , there 's , uh , teams , other European teams and there 's teams in the United States an- , and they 're playing now during the summer months and it 's really you know , overkill . Oh yeah . And there 's only so much football you can watch . Yeah . Well , I like to do , I do n't like to watch . Yeah , that 's good . I do n't like to watch anything . So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff . I think it 's an , excuse to do nothing and I , I can see what you 're saying about the male bonding and the -- Yeah . -- guys get together and that 's kind of cool . That 's fun , you know . Uh-huh . But it can get really overdone . Now , have you ever been to a professional football game ? Yeah , I have . Have you ? Yeah , yeah ,
