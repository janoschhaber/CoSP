I guess that 's how they tend to talk about it . But that they just kind of lived out in the woods and ever now and then , they 'd go and shoot their rifles and then they 'd , come back and you know . But that they were n't really allowed to do anything . I , uh , to me it seems like we only went halfway . If even halfway . Yeah , it 's funny . Tonight I was , uh , helping my kid with an essay on , uh , Stalin . And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it , how , uh , in World War Two , the personalties of Stalin , Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war , it was , uh , it was almost a personal struggle among these three , uh , I guess you 'd have to call them great men in some sense . Uh-huh .
