But that , that 's , and you really feel you can accomplish something and to help other people too , that 's neat . Yes , it has really nothing to do with , uh , actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that , Uh-huh . it was just that I happened to organize this group , Right . that was about seventy people . That 's wonderful . That , is n't , yeah , that , that , Yeah . those numbers were , were great but it , Yeah , well , I think it sounds good . I 've never belonged to a garden club because I 've always been more interested in just doing what I can do on my own , I 've never had , Yes . the time really to get involved in the organized sort of format , but I know people who do it and , and enjoy it very much . Well , and actually , I think that most women 's garden clubs that I 've been aware of in the past , uh , are only flowers , what I would like , we 've spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma . Just moved to , to North Carolina , Oh . and , uh , we were orig- , originally , of course , from this area , from Virginia , but , uh , in North , uh , in Oklahoma , it 's the men 's garden clubs that I would have wanted to join . My word . And you would have because they do all kinds of , uh , gardening and not just flowers like women do . For heaven 's sake . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , um , there are n't men 's gardening clubs in this area that I know of , they 're , they 're women . But , um , and usually they 're the tea type things , you know , where they have a little luncheon and they do their thing . Uh-huh . But , um , flowers are primarily the emphasis , Yes , I think so too . um , whereas I enjoy vegetable gardening almost more , I do flowers sort of look pretty but I , I really like to do the vegetables .
