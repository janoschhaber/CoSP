Uh-huh . all over , you know , the , um , city and they would , um , be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left . Yeah . So , um , I think you need to make , you know , if you do , do day care centers , you know you should make frequent checks and , um , to check in on them when they 're not expecting it . Yeah . Because they do , do things differently when you 're not around , so . Well that , I know wh- , the things that we kind of looked at is , is you want to see how many teachers you have . Uh-huh . And , and how many kids they have and how they break it up . Right . Because we had , we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in . Uh-huh . It , it was a really good one , and in fact , it worked out for us because my wife , we kind of bartered . My wife did artwork for them and then , you know , so we got our day care free . Uh-huh . But they did n't have enough teachers and , Well , this one was set up good . I mean they had two teachers -- Uh-huh . -- to every room . Um , sometimes three . And they had a good system like so when you walked in , everything looks cool . Uh-huh . The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough . They did not show them care to these small children who are being left . Uh-huh . Um , they , one time I picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other . Huh . You know , he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up . And I said , no , this child was crying and needed some comfort , you know , Yeah . what is your problem . So , um , Did , did they separate them by age group ? Yes .
