Well I had a weird , there 's a little sensing device , uh , in front of my , uh , um , I 'm not sure , right in front of the f- , fan , it 's a , it 's an air conditioner sensing device . I do n't know why , it actually , there 's a metal piece that fits through the belts , uh , and somehow that broke off and , uh , I , I still ca n't figure out how it broke , and , uh , anyway , so a- , this piece obviously , um , I have a Subaru , and , uh , I think you can only get it through Subaru dealer , etcetera , so . Uh-huh . Uh , this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks . Goodness , are you able , And , and I have n't had too many problems with my car , I got a eighty-eight Subaru , G L X T and it , Uh-huh . uh , and then , you know just basic maintenance and oil changes an I , and I do not do my oil changes and I will not do my oil changes . I 've , I think the first time I tried to do one and ended up , um , trying to ge- , uh , yo- , borrowed somebody else 's jack and I did this and I went and bought everything , Uh-huh . so after buying the filter and all the oil , you 're looking at ten bucks at least , Uh-huh . or somewhere in there an , and , uh , and then to go to the trouble , that I figured it 's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube . Yeah . So that , that 's , um , you know , as far as any maintenance on my car , I , I shy away from the oil changes , that 's for sure . Uh-huh , well my car is , uh , it 's an eighty-six and I really had n't had any , any trouble with it un- , until that
