I 'll let you go first . Oh , well , what 's there to say ? Does n't seem like it 's being carried out very well in my opinion . Seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that I do n't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody . Yeah , it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty . Yeah . Yeah , I know what you mean . Um , I , in Maryland they , they do have capital punishment , Uh-huh . and , uh , I 've seen , uh , a lot of people get convicted , sentenced , and then just nothing happens , Yeah . just endless , endless , endless appeals . Uh-huh , well from what I underst , I saw a statistic just a few days ago , um , so far this ye- , year , or was it during the last year , somewh- , during a year 's time , I think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation . Meanwhile , there were twenty-five hundred people on death row . So I , I , and it 's building up , you know , they 're , they 're convicting them faster than they 're executing them so it 's really building up . Yeah , what 's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years . Uh-huh . And , uh , here in Maryland I know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons , uh , just , Yeah , everybody 's got that . Yeah , but I mean , in , here it 's , uh , to the point where they were letting prisoners go . Uh-huh . Uh , commuting the sentences of those that were in , in jail for lesser crimes , Yeah . in order to put more people in , into the jails . Uh-huh . And it was just , uh , amazing to me , and of course they made a big deal out of the , the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out , Yeah . and being rearrested an . Is n't , is n't Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was .
