-- and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in , uh , Germany and Japan . Uh , Well , it 's a lot easier to , to save it when you do n't get your hands on it first . Right . When you have the , when you have the , uh , the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has , and you can , uh , offer some incentive and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside -- Right . -- you can really build up , uh , the savings and the , that you would n't otherwise do and , Uh , what about , what about , uh , lesser , uh , benefits perhaps for you but for , for the women in the , in the corporation . For example , uh , oh , Leave ? Yeah . Do they e- , even , do they have father leaves or anything like that ? You know , I , I do n't think so yet . They may have , uh , just plain parental leave , which either one can take . Uh-huh . Uh , I , their , uh , I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short . Uh -- Oh , I do too . -- uh , uh , I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks . Oh , I think , I think it 's just a crying shame , uh , for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks . Right , and , uh , She is n't recovered . And , uh -- There , -- the infant needs her desperately , at that point and time . There ought to be , uh , uh , some compromise that could , where , uh , where the person would be guaranteed a , uh , career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position -- Uh-huh . -- uh , in exchange for a longer period of time . Right , I agree . It 's , uh , it 's so important to families then and , uh , and yet anybody who 's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up . Oh , sure . Uh , Especially in this day and age . That , You do n't want to start over again anywhere .
