I came from a family of five . I had four brothers , Uh-huh . the only girl . Oh . And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled . Which that , I never felt spoiled . In fact I always thought my toys were destroyed . I was going to say , my sister was n't spoiled very much . No . Usually busy fighting for survival .
