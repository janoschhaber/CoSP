I mean I do no think I could handle prison . Yeah . I mean it would be -- Well , I would be interested in -- -- very difficult , -- finding out what the , uh , percentage of drug related type things are , Well , there must be a , and , uh , ca- , a , a , a very great degree of that . Yeah . But , but there again I , I do not know if the , the jury system itself , uh , comes in to play there . I would think that , one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability , of course th- , it is a constitutional right that the press must have here , is th- , the interviewing of jurors after the trial . I mean that , it seems to me that , that , that when a jury makes a decision , they should not be asked , uh , before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision . I mean , I do not , Yeah . I imagine there is a certain , certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that . But I , I would think I , if I did anything , I would protect the juror from , from any sort of an inquisition after . Well , I know , uh , on the other hand though , when , uh- , after the Barry trial , Yeah . up here , you know , the big local -- Yeah . -- trial , Oh , yeah . Well , as well as national . I do a lot of business up in Washington . I was there during the , during the trial actually , yeah . Yeah . And the opposite was true of me . Uh , after the case was over , I was like , somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way they did , Yeah , you know .
