Oh , uh-huh . -- and I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library . They keep it open , you know , for kids to do their work -- Right . -- and he , um , and then they , the school district hires an aide , you know , to work -- Sure . -- for me . Well , my son is my aide . Oh , well , that 's nice . So , two nights a week for four hours we 're stuck together -- You 're stuck together . -- and there 's usually not very much business . No . I mean , some nights it 's just real , real quiet . So . I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part . So we , I have sort of a captive audience , so I really do spend probably more time with him than , than most , you know . Right . But , uh , of course I 'm away from my other son those hours , too . But his dad 's at home -- And so that -- -- pretty much that time . -- kind of gives him , uh , time with his dad , then . Yeah , that 's true , yeah . Gives him a little bit of that individual time . But , but it is hard , once they get that age , I mean , their friends are the most important thing there is . Right , and they want to be able to spend , uh . That 's right . Well , I 've even noticed that with my five year old . She started kindergarten this year , and -- Uh-huh . -- every day that she 's not at school , uh , she thinks we need to have someone over and play -- Uh-huh . -- and that kind of -- Yeah , it 's kind of hard . -- yeah , it 's hard , I think , uh , I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should . Yeah . I 'm more worried about , Oh , I did n't this done , I did n't get , the kitchen needs to be cleaned -- Uh-huh . -- this needs to be done , and -- Uh-huh . -- and I need to re , remind myself to slow down and -- Right . -- it 'll still be there tomorrow . Yeah , that 's true . But that 's kind of hard to do , you know .
