I , I think the line item veto is not , not , is not necessarily a bad thing , assuming that the , uh , the , the President , uh , uses it to get rid of , uh , this kind of waste . On the other hand , uh , it , it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things . Yeah . Uh , and just to get rid of the unimportant things .

And then , of course , the bottom fell out . It 's , uh , I mean , it 's , it 's tough .
