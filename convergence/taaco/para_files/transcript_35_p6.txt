Oh , th- , when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him . Oh , yeah . And then he , uh , the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards , you know . Uh-huh . And that horse has been such a pal to him , Yeah . when he was alone . You can tell I 'm an animal lover , you can hear my dog . Unfortunately we do n't have any animals , so , uh . Yeah . It was a beautiful story , it really was . It , there was a lot of pretty scenery , too , in that movie . Uh-huh , uh-huh . What did you think about the buffalo scenes . Oh , I thought it was awful , That was , and so graphic , Yeah . I mean I had n't even imagined it , you know . I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo . Uh-huh . Um , I had a friend who had fixed some , uh , chili , buffalo chili and , about a week before went to see the movie . Oh , oh . Of course they raise them now , you know , to eat . Uh-huh , yeah , it 's not , But she , we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that . Uh-huh , well at least you know that it was n't same situation that the buffalo died in . No it was n't . Um , I thought the scenes when the buffalos running , though , were beautiful , like that was great . Oh , yeah . And there were so many of them . I did n't know that , that many buffaloes alive , much less in one place . Yeah , really . So that was pretty . And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape , you know , you could follow this , this beaten down path , Yeah . and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing . I wonder how they kept up with them , though , it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast . I know . I guess they graze , though , that would n't be a problem . Yeah , yeah . Uh , have you seen any of the behind the scenes , uh , of , of that movie .
