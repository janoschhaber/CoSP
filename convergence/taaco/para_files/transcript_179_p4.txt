I take it you have n't spent any time in the military ? No , I have n't . As a civilian that 's never been attached to any form of the military , I know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in , never did make the newspapers . Uh-huh . But , during that same time frame , did n't you get some feeling , that , I mean , they 're getting all these weapons and stuff ? Did n't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff ? You mean in the , in the most recent conflict ? In any of them since eighty-one . Oh . Yeah , definitely . I , I 'm , I 'm a little bit shocked to what the U S has done in terms of selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years . Yeah , I think we , we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too . It 's bad enough that the Soviets do it . It all boils down to , whether it 's our side , their side , it 's a matter of money , Um . to a certain extent . Uh-huh . The deal the Iraqis have with the Russians was for oil . Yeah . It 's scary to know that they 're supplying that many people with weapons . Especially when it 's to the south of us . Uh , the ones to the south are more regional conflict . They 're not really that worried about invading north . They 're more interested in , they 've got a screwed up situation , I 'll give them that . From Mexico all the way down into Cen- , Central and South America . The situation down there is weird and it 's very screwed up .
