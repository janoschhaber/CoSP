Yes . It looks like I 'm going to have to get up there again , because we may have a leak . Are you in the section of Texas that 's been getting so much rain ? We 've been getting quite a bit , maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio , but , uh , well , I 'm right , Plano 's just north of Dallas -- Oh , okay . -- and there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas that are under water right now , I guess , I saw on the news . Yeah . But you 're probably , what , about halfway across the state from San Antonio , though , are n't you ? Well , we 're up , uh , we 're north -- Yeah . -- and , uh , oh , about , uh , I do n't know , uh , eighty to a hundred miles south of the Oklahoma line , I guess . Yeah , okay . But you 're still getting a good bit of the rain , though . Uh , we did have a little bit of rain yesterday . So far we have n't had any today . And , uh , I suppose that means I should be , uh , getting up there to look at that , uh , shingle , but , uh -- Yeah . -- I had something else planned today , so I guess I 'll let it go awhile . Yeah . Is it asphalt shingles , or , or MUMBLEx . They 're , uh , no , they 're , uh , wood shake . Ooh , that should be a lot of fun . Yeah . Did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them ? No , I , uh , as a matter of fact , we 've never had a leak actually yet . Now this , we just bought the house last year , and , uh , uh , just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles .
