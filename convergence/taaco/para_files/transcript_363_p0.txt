Where do you live ? Uh , we live in Plano . Okay , so , that 's a , Uh , and where you are ? I 'm in Richardson , so -- Uh-huh . -- when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at , uh , Maceo High School -- Right . -- in Dallas . Right , that is so frightening . It is , you know , Uh , do you have children in school ? No , mine are already in college now , so -- Yeah . -- I do n't have to , at least when they were in high school , it was beginning but not like the rampages . Well , I have , my oldest is his first year in high school so we have all this to , to look forward to , and it is really frightening , uh , to think that you ca n't even send them to school in safety . I mean , certainly , you know , you ca n't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas , but , you know , when you ca n't even , send them on their normal activities in safety , it , it 's really frightening . That 's true . And , uh , I really , you know , they 're coming down on the principal , but I really do n't know what they can do . I mean , it 's just in so much of society with the violence and the kids having access to weapons and drugs and I , I really do n't know what , what can be done . Yeah , well , I just , I just do n't understand how , of course , in my little world , how guns could be so available . Well , I do n't either ,
