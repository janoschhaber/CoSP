What are you guys having for Christmas ? What are we having ? Let 's see . Well , I 'm not planning the menu . Oh , you 're not . No . We usually go out to ei- , either one of our folks , they both live close to -- Yeah . -- but , um , I do n't know , it seems like a , a big thing for Christmas is usually ham . Well , funny you should mention that . I 'm a pig farmer . Oh , you are -- Yeah . -- huh . Well , now , it 's kind of a hobby more than anything else , but we 're going to have , uh , wild boar -- My goodness . -- we , uh , we killed a boar the other day , it was , you know , mating with the sows , and you ca n't use the piglets , you know , so . Huh . It 's about six months of no use , so , we , uh , we shot him and cleaned him out and had him , you know , processed into ham , and , uh , we 're also going to have a little roast suckling pig , because I , I 've got one that 's got a , a hernia -- Oh , really . -- and rather than , you know , pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery , we 'll just cook him and eat him . Is that , is that hard ? Well , no , hey , I tell you what , preparing a little pig is , is a snap , I 'm telling you , real easy , easier than chicken .
