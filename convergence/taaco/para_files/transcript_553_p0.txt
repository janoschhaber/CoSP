Hi . So , do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have ? Uh , actually no , because , because I 'm in school . I , I kind of miss out on most of the current events . I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it . Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then ? Uh , I do n't watch a lot of it , but that 's the on , basically that 's my only major source of information . Um . What about , what about you ? Well , I read , uh , I get a bunch of different things . I get a newspaper every day and I try to at , at least have a few minutes to look through that and I look through , uh , I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I , I pretty much read that cover to cover and I , as far as , you know , that satisfies most of the short term news I get . Uh , do n't watch much T V , do n't have enough time and , uh , do n't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that , you know , they might give you a little blurbs like -- Yeah . -- this happened or that happened and that 's about all I ever hear of it . Uh , but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK and for the longer term I , I read , uh , like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and , and , uh , READERS ' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which , they , the news is n't , like , immediate what you 'd generally think of as news , but it 's recent material . And it 's more in depth . Yeah , it is , it is more in depth , less broad . Well , actually , it 's , probably is n't less broad , but it 's just more in depth and , uh , it is , it is more sig , it is more just significant information , you know . It is the big events , not the little events . Yeah . Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main , you know . I know , where they 're just trying to fill in . Yes , or they 're making , making time because they to fill in an hour 's worth of news . Yeah .
