So the first , you know , the , the , the , what I call residential level -- Uh-huh . -- at the side that 's in the hill is about four feet deep . Um , I see . And the side that 's on the , uh , the other side is about six feet high . Oh . So I 've got a pretty good grade there . Yeah . And then when I put the verandas whi , which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north , south and east sides -- Uh-huh . -- that will define the shop . Yeah , that 's kind of like , like a Victorian style ? Exactly . Yeah . I , I 've always liked that . The , you know , I , we do n't have much yard but I built a small deck in the back . Uh-huh . But , you know , I , I see these magazines where , you know , dig your , your own deck . Uh-huh . I , I kind of wish I had them , those size property and , and , uh , one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck .
