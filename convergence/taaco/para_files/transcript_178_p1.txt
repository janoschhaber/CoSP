I really do n't know what 's going to take place with the Cowboys this year . Everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they 're going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year . In a way that happened this past season , and I think that 's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there 's a chance that maybe , uh , these guys are right , maybe they will come through and , and do something this year . I look for it to be a pretty good year . Boy they , uh , they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago . They did , uh , they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we were n't , were n't familiar with . Some of them turned out to be pretty good players , uh , some of them did n't and you know maybe the stuff that , uh , Jerry Jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off . At least we hope it will . Yeah , I 'm , I keep waiting for the Eagles to get over the hump . They make it to the playoffs it seems for the last few years but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there . And you know , they 've got a lot of the tools to do it , but doggone if they ca n't just put it together , uh , you know , they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham , who 's just , you know , phenomenal , but , he , he 's too streaky it seems . Yeah ,
