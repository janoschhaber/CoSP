That 's it . -- I did n't know that . And I think the service charge is pretty low , too , but , I 'm not sure . Um . Well , you know , Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards . Uh-huh . I worked w- , at Sears for over ten years and , uh , it was only a Sears card that they would take -- Uh-huh . -- until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card , another credit card that was -- Uh-huh . -- accepted , so , you know , now they 'll take the Discover , but I still do n't know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard . Uh-huh . But , uh -- Yeah . -- I never did apply for a Discover card . I just figure with the Visa and -- Uh-huh . -- American Express , I probably have an , I can do enough damage with those two . Yeah , I think it 's best to keep the number down -- Uh-huh . -- that you have . Yeah . So , I 've got some that I , you know , I have n't even used at all , uh , past few years I probably would n't be able to use them . Uh-huh . But , uh , I , I do like my Dillard 's , I have to admit that 's one of my favorite places to shop . Uh-huh . And I do use Dillard 's probably as , more than any of the other department stores . Uh-huh . But , Yeah . Well , Well , Do you have anything else to say ? No , not too much more about credit cards . Okay . I do n't think I do either so , Okay well , Well , it was good talking to you . Good talking to you Beth . Okay . Good luck . Have a good evening . You , too . Bye-bye . Bye .
