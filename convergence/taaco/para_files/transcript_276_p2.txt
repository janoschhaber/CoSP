I 'm surprised that , I was surprised at the ending of , you know , with all the funny things happening and different things . I just wonder if , if , uh , they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show , since it 's gone on for so long , it looks like , Uh-huh . it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things . Uh-huh . Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show . I know . Of course , I guess that 's not bad . Alan Alda did it on MASH . I know . Is n't that funny ? It has n't hurt him at all . So do you , do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour ? Oh , I do n't usually like stuff that continues . That 's why I 'm surprised I like those two shows , because usually I like , you know , stuff that just ends sort of , that you just , you do n't have to , In one hour , like QUANTUM LEAP . have watched , you know .
