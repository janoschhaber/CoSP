Okay . So how serious is the , subject of crime in your area ? Well , needless to say , here in Washington , D C this is the war zone . Uh , D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital . It 's , uh , it 's really bad here . Uh , for example , the , uh , local high school , uh , they 've already found two students with sawed off shotguns -- Jeez . -- and they 're starting to , uh , get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school , of all things . So , Well , luckily , it has n't gotten that bad here . Uh-huh . Uh , San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime . Uh-huh . Uh , but it 's on the uprise , especially in a lot of the , uh , outlying agricultural towns .
