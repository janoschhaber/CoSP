We 're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis and , probably the first question would be whether you 've ever had to go through that process . Well , not so much personally but my , um , husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother , I mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such . They live down in College Station where , his parents do too . And they put her in a home last year . Uh-huh . She appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to , uh , not be able to be in her apartment on her own . Uh-huh . So they found a , a place nearby that they put her in last year . So it was pretty much a physical decision ? Uh , yeah , although she is , uh , in pretty good health and she 's , does n't take any medication , it 's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point . Um . Then she was starting to get , uh , you know , lose memory sometimes and , which is kind of frightening when she 's in the car . Yeah .
