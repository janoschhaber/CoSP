And then he ended up being accused of it . Oh , that 's right , I remember now . Yeah , I remember . Yeah , so , I mean it really kind of had a turn at the end , when you found out who it was . Uh-huh . Well , I 've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies . I think he ought to stay Indiana Jones .

But , uh , I tell you , Sean Connery in the HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER , I , I never did care for him as , in the James Bond movies . I do n't know he was too .
