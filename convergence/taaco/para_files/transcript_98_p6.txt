Oh , it is , it 's , it 's a lot of fun , especially if you can find somebody that 's , uh , that 's got the same level of interest . That seem to be the hardest -- Yeah . -- thing . Well , about , that 's , that 's true of any sport , you know . If you want to play tennis , or -- Yeah -- -- racquetball , -- you do n't want to go out and get beat to death , but . Right , and , and people do n't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time , you know -- No . -- and , and , uh , And then , you know , we 've got some guys here that they are , you know , four and five handicappers -- Uh-huh . -- and they do n't like to play with me because I 'm too slow for them , so . Right . You know , but get somebody around your own handicap , and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time . That 's right , yeah . And I 've , you know , I 've never , never yet have I walked up , now I 've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with , and never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that would n't allow me to join their twosome or threesome . That 's true . They are always friendly . That 's true . Sure , come on out , you know , and they do n't mind if you make a mistake , they do n't mind saying , Well , you know , let me tea , tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that , or , Well . You know , it 's , it 's pretty nice and friendly out there -- That , that 's , that 's so . -- and you ca n't find that in all sports .
