I mean we 're talking , you know , forty-five , fifty minutes for biking , Right . uh , and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind . And then another half an hour , you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff . It was a big hunk , hunk of the day . Uh , and then of course another hour to get back home . Uh , so I 've been doing that less , and , and concentrating more on , you know , light biking when I get home on the evening and then , you know , some more on the weekends . Yeah .
