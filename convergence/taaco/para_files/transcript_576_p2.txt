Yeah , really . But , uh , that 's the way it is . I do n't know , I , I personally feel that , uh , uh , if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them , you know , that 's the way it goes and , you know , people , man- , more than manufacturers should get a clue and , you know , they should start making quality products . Yeah , I think they 're beginning to . The , the days of do n't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away and , That 's what I thought , too , until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue . Uh-huh . Uh , they 've got all the American , well , all the , all the cars rated , you know , and , uh , essentially , I h , I do n't see much of a trend . I mean , just like every other time that you look at it , the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there . There 's nothing wrong with them . Uh , and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars . But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy and they 're pieces of junk . I know .
