so everything 's metric and then you go to read some order book or something and it 's all confusing so I do n't understand as much , so I think we should get one adopted permanently . Well , I guess that is the policy , but it 's been the policy for a long time and nothing ever happens . Uh , I suppose things , some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that 's happening , having a new generation come up that 's more used to it . Yeah , a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to . They have to for international trade . Yeah . But , I g , guess it 's , it 's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be , uh , be- , be- , because of , of , uh , of computers coming into everything . Uh-huh . Yeah , I do n't think switching back and forth is that big a deal .
