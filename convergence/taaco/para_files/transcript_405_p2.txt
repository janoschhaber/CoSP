what do you do when you 're putting ? That 's a good thing . That 's something I could learn actually . That 's when I do my worst . I finally get to the green and I think I 'm doing all , all fine and then , Just walking around the hollow and making sure there 's not really , you know , checking the ground and , and so forth , you know . Yeah . See how it 's going to break or whatever . Can you really see it though ? Yeah . What about the speed ? If you get , if you get down on the ground you really can . Can you tell ho , no- , but can you tell how , how fast you 're going to hit it ? Um , well , if you know if it 's up on a slope that you 've got to hit it not kill it but you 've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it 's , it 's , you know , because when it 's going up a hill it 's going to break in a direction . Yeah , but you can feel that ? Yeah . I do n't know I have , I can gi- , get it within like , you know , four or five feet or something but I do n't have enough field . Now I 'm T V watching . Yeah . They make you die at the hole every time . Yeah . Oh , it just dies and rolls in . I do n't know , But I , it 's hard for me . The , the , it 's , it 's like I said once I get up on the green I 'm fine , but that , that tee shot , uh , it , you know , when teeing off i- , I 'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground so it , it takes me awhile to get to the hole but , Once you 're there , you 're all set though . I 'm all set . We should play team golf then . I 'll get us there
