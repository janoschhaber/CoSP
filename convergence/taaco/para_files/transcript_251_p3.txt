Uh-huh . Because the porch is pretty big , I live in town . But just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts . I do not like it . And I just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff . And I just plowed through the whole nine yards . Got up everything . There was some plants that are just Spring bloomers -- Uh-huh . -- and I , the lea- , when the blooms died , the leaves were just horrible looking . Uh-huh . So I just broke all them off .
