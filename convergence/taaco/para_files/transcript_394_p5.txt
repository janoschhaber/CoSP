Yes , I do n't have to worry about that and this is the time of year we 're starting to lose , they 're all falling now . That 's right , that 's right , they are . I 'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done . We just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but , not , not much . Just , just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks and if you did n't do anything about it , then they 'd probably the leaves just blow away . Right . It 's not too bad . Okay , do we have to speak for a certain amount of time ? No , I do n't think so . Okay . Okay . It was really nice speaking to you . It was good to speak with you too . Okay , and have a happy Thanksgiving . Thank you , you too . Bye-bye . Bye-bye .
