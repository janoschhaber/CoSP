Oh , no , it 's too cold . Hot tubs are not , uh , not too bad , but . I could deal with a hot tub . Those are nice . So , what part of Mississippi are you from ? I 'm from Laurel . Whereabouts is that ? That 's way down towards the south . Not quite on the coast , but we 're about two hours from the coast . Oh , and you do have cold weather down there ?
