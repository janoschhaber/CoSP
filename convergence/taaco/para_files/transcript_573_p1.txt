-- from cover to cover . How do you like it ? It 's been , it 's been a while since I read the Dallas news . I , uh , fact , last time I read the Dallas , Dallas news I was in Arkansas . I , uh , The TIMES HERALD went out of business here -- Oh , yeah ? -- and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one , Fort Worth newspaper . Well , that must be pretty bad . So , how did that happen , anyway ? Uh , financial trouble . No , not how , I mean , when did it , when did they MUMBLEx , Oh , when did it happen ? Yeah . I guess they closed down about three months ago . Oh , really . Um . So , how do you keep up ? Oh , me , I , uh , good grief , I read the TIMES , LOS ANGELES TIMES . There 's , quite a task if you 've ever run into one . They 're , uh -- Yes , they 're very -- -- speci , -- voluminous . Yeah , they 're thick . Uh , if there 's something you want to know , it 's , it 's in the TIMES and then , and in detail . Uh , they , uh , we , we used to have two papers here in town and then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of , oh , I do n't know , just nobody was buying it really . So there really is only one major L A now ?
