Um . Little , little oak tree that was dead , and cut it up and split it MUMBLEx . Yeah , that 's because it , it ca n't tolerate a freeze this early . Is that right ? Well . If it would came later it would be all right ? Uh , it , there 's some trees like the oaks , like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy . There 's , nothing bothers them . Their leaves are still green , and some of the other oaks . There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves . Um , what I notice mostly is the red maples , that the leaves are just dead , the dogwoods still look , still look , you know , they got , uh , bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit , but they still look pretty good . Um . It just depends on the , on the , uh , on the tree .
