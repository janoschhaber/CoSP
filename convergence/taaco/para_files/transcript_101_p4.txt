The Mazda definitely did not . Not at all . They 're worse than American cars I think or just as bad as far as resale goes . I did pretty well with my , uh , Regal because it was in really good shape but , Yeah . it still looked real nice , the , the interior was still really nice , there was n't cracks all over the dash board and stuff . Right . And it had some , some nice features . So I ended up okay with the Buick , Good . and I anticipate the same thing with the Honda whenever I decide to sell it , of course , I may never sell it , Right . I may drive it until it 's dead but , Yeah . That 's what I did with the Mazda , drive it until the , until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off , Yeah . so , probably what I 'll do again . Yeah . But I really like the Hondas . I like foreign cars -- Uh-huh . -- a lot . Well , I looked at the Mitsubishi Galant .
