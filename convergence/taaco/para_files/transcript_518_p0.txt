How do you feel about gun control ? Well , uh , I mean I do n't think that guns should be outlawed -- Um . -- but it 's going to , a lot of the stuff that , I mean all you do is to get guns -- Uh-huh . -- and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen , Texas not too long ago , Uh-huh . But I do n't really know , I mean , unless they do , uh , just outlaw them , how you can , uh , prevent that . Well , do n't you think that you know , just having , you know , some , you know almost like a driver 's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with , with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry . Yeah , that , well do you even know what the procedures are now ? Um . There is no national , But , it 's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun , especially if you have the money to pay for it . Uh , in most States as long as you are n't a convicted felon . Yeah . You know or on probation or , uh , you know , other obvious things like that . Uh , and I know , I know that like in a lot of states you could , you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before . You know , be , be obviously insane , and then , you , you know but have your legal right to get a gun . Huh . I did n't know that . Well , that 's pretty scary . So , does , now do they want us to say where we feel about it , like in rating it one to ten .
