and it 'll , you know , pass out , Uh-huh . and it 's , you know , it 's killed several people . Do you , uh , smoke ? Um , actually , I 'm a very , I just smoke one in the evening if that . So , I 'm a very , very light smoker . W- , yeah , it 's kind of l- , It was kind of funny . They were doing some , uh , ozone testing , and , uh , th- , the E P A and they were just screening some candidates , and I do n't think I 'd ever , you know , do that , but they , uh , asked me if I was a smoker , and I did n't fit into the smoker 's category , and I did n't fit into the nonsmoker 's category . Um , it was , you know , I was just one of those -- Yeah , because you do smoke one a day . -- yeah , in between people . So that kind of threw them off . Um . Uh , But they 're doing a lot of research here , uh , the E P A . For the air pollution . For ozone , and oh , yeah , all that . They 're , they 're real big into it . They 've got Research Triangle Park here , and they 're , you know , they 're just doing a lot of , uh , lot of stuff . Huh . But , they , I do n't hear much about it down here . Course , Texas , we do n't have a bunch of c- , pollution . Huh-uh . But , too , we 've got that air coming in off the coast . Oh , uh-huh . And you know it 'd blow it up north . Uh-huh . So , maybe that 's part of the reason it 's not so bad down here . Uh-huh . But , no it would seem like it would be the same way in , on the California coastline , would n't it ? Oh , gosh , I think I would hate to live in California , the smog there . Uh-huh . I mean , I ca n't believe they have warnings here , which it , it 's mainly just when it gets real , real hot . Uh-huh . But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially . Really ? W- , well that 's kind of good to know , because I thought lord , I thought I lived in a halfway decent area .
