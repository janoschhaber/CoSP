Uh , the , uh , the guy , uh , apparently had a , a , mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people . Uh , just , uh , kill them with , with as much blood and , and guts as possible . Oh , how awful . It was true , it was truly awful . It was not one that I picked , but , uh , uh , it , it did show some , some , uh , some interesting things about the F B I because they were the , the , uh , the characters trying , trying to get him were F B I people and , uh , uh , of the , of the few good things that were in it , it did show , uh , a lot about the F B I . About the training , and , and how they go through training and how they try to , to develop , uh , uh , a mental picture of who they 're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that . And it was , uh , uh , it was pretty telling about the , the , the F B I and their procedures . I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction . Yeah , I , I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I , uh , going , I guess . Yeah , well , they keep it rather secretive , yes . Yeah , yeah . Well the most recent movie I saw , uh , I 'm afraid was , uh , well two , two of them actually . Uh , the RAIN MAN was one . Oh that was great one . Was n't that fabulous ,
