Yeah . It 's pretty sad to think , uh , about those who , even today , are graduating from school and they are telling that they do n't know how to read , you know . Well , my stepson , you know , I , he went into the Navy or Air Force . I just really get my military , I married into a military family , and I do n't know , I re- , address them all as generals so I do n't offend anybody . But , uh , you know , fortunately for him , he was n't dumb but boy he sure had trouble , you know , putting things on , on paper . Yeah . And one of the things that , that they did for him . They tested him and they said that he 's , you know , great in electronics but he , you know , he 's , really does need the basic skills . And they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training . And at that point , he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors . Oh . This is the kid who , who really , you know , barely -- Yeah . -- made it through high school . And I keep thinking , you know , it 's not , it 's really not too late at any point to do , you know , some- , That 's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it .
