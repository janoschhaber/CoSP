Uh-huh . And here it 's , uh , well it 's right by the ocean , but , um , it 's not the same as Corpus . Corpus , you get that humid salty feeling in the air . Uh-huh . But here , um , well the water is extremely cold , up here , you can lay on the beach all you want , but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming , you have to wear a wet suit . Uh-huh . And a thick wet suit at that , because it 's just extremely cold and I , for some reason , because of the cold , uh , ocean , uh , water , the air is always cool . It 's never humid or sticky or salty feeling , so I really like that about this area . And , uh , we just had n't expected it , we were used to , what , uh , gulf coast weather was like , Yeah . when we came here to Pacific coast weather . It 's just completely different and it 's much nicer . Yeah . Probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference , Uh-huh .
