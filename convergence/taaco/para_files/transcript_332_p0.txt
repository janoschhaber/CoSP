Okay , while I was waiting for you to connect , I , I thought of a couple of menus , so I decided it had to be in it , informal or not . You know -- Uh-huh . Uh-huh . -- because that 's a lot of fun , especially this time of year where it 's so nice out . Yes . Um , if it was formal I 'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something . I 'm not I 'm not into formal dinner parties , but -- I see . -- I 'd probably go with lasagna , a green salad , and garlic bread . So what do you use for cookbooks ? Um , I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was married , but , it 's kind of the bible of cooking -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- for me .
