Yeah , it , it , it 's , it 's a lot warmer , a lot drier too , because usually about this time of year , this , you know , you see a little bit more rain . I mean by , by mid February , I mean , we start getting a lot of rain . Yeah , yeah , well I remember last year , or the year before , But it , uh , we had ice and snow , uh , uh , terrible ice storm , uh , around this time of the year . Uh-huh .
