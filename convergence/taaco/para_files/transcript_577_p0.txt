The last auto repair I had was I have a nineteen eighty-four Nissan truck I had a tune up done and I had , I had the brakes done on it and then , the reason I did that was because I do n't have a scope and it has eight spark plugs and it 's hard to , to get get at them and plus the time on them . I just do n't have time any more . Uh , as far as maintenance tasks that I do myself , I , I usually change the oil and wash the air filter and I , I had an occasion to change , to have to change the battery once , but , the brakes , I was really surprised that the brakes . I wanted , I do have the background . I know what needs to be done and I know that the oil needs , should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings and the lube , lubrication system needs to be lubricated and so I , I stay on top of that but I I wanted my front wheels , I wanted the bearings packed and they wanted something like fifteen dollars , uh , a front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it -- Just to pack the bearings ? -- just to pack the bearings , but what I found is that they had a brake job and they , I had them ,
