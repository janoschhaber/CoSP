Okay , do you subscribe to magazines yourself ? I do n't , uh , subscribe to any magazines at home , because we get so many at work that , uh , I need to read that , uh , I just do n't take any at home . Oh , I see . I get , uh , MCCALL 'S . Of course , anything that appeals to the homemaker since that 's my main line of interest . Uh-huh . And then once in a while I 'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and -- Uh-huh . -- realize why I do n't want to re- , go back to work . What I enjoy about staying home . Right . And , uh , I read magazines mainly because they 're fast and if I want to relax while I watch T V , of course , I 'm one of those that does two things at once , and , uh , I read GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and BETTER HOMES and MCCALL 'S .
