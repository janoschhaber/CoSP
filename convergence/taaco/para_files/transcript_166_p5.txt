and to , uh , Algeria and to , uh , Southeast Asia and lots of , uh , out-of-the-way places . But I do n't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went , Uh-huh . in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better . Well , I know in , I personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught Christianity in Japan . Uh-huh . And I was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me . It taught me not to be so self-centered and it , you know , to think of others . Uh-huh . But I do n't know if I was doing it in different situation , you know , not a really religious background , if , if I would get a lot out of it . You know , I think I did because it , you know , it emphasized that sort of thing . You know , a lot of -- Sure . -- self evaluation . And it was definitely voluntary , too .

Well , what about a voluntary program ? Do you think that would be a good idea ? Um , well , like I say , I know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth , like teenagers to go and do , um , work in the national parks and work in , uh , neighborhoods to do , um , clean up and that sort of thing . But I do n't know what organization it 's under .
