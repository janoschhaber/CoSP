Yeah . I think so , more than drugs . And I know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab . Yeah . They would pay for an alcohol -- Uh-huh . -- but they do n't always pay for drug rehabilitation . Well , I guess that 's one of the positive things that ha , have come out of it , some of the employee assistance program . If you do test positive for something -- Yeah . -- they will give you an op- , o- , opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job . That 's true . And I , I , th , think that 's fair . Yeah , I think the benef- , the company benefits in the long run . Yeah . That 's true . That 's about all I have , to say on it . What , what kind of testing do they do when you went ? Uh , it 's a urine test . Urine screen . And , Yeah , they , uh , it was really very official . You have to go in a room solely by yourself , sign papers that say you were totally alone , sign papers that say this is yours , and , and you have to seal the bottle yourself and label it yourself and , Uh-huh . all of that .
