And my other two pots are , they 're kind of , they 're pretty big , and I have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area , so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood , there 's no room for much else . But my dad , uh , my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house . And I 'd , I think when I was real little I probably had a finger in on that every time he did it -- Uh-huh . -- and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff . But I 've never really tried anything like that since then .
