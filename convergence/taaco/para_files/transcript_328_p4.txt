I do n't have to live through many , any of those really , a bad , I mean , nothing comparable , I guess , to what you 've had before . Well , I 've only been here just a short time , too , so I have n't been through -- -- any of those either , so . I have in Michigan , but in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow and life goes on . You 're right . So , as I understand it here , if there 's anything , they 'll call off schools and , and close businesses . Well , they get ice , and no one can drive on ice . Right . I mean , we used to think they were pansies , but then when you decided what ice was . Right , the real definition of ice . So , well , I think we 've discussed it good enough today . I think so . It was , It was nice talking with you . It was good talking to you . Maybe we 'll get the next time . Okay . Take care . Okay . Bye-bye . Bye .
