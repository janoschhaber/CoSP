Yeah , I think you 've , you 've earned that though . Yeah , I feel like I have , you know , because well , we 're just a age now , I 'm not old but , I 'm older . Uh-huh . And , uh , I got to stay home with my kids , which I really wanted to do , but now I could not go back and do it . Yeah . And I mean , I did stuff but , Right . to me it feels like I must have done nothing . And I think it 's just the new way that people are thinking . Yeah , I think so . But , uh , I think it would be neat if , if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you . Well you know more and more of them are , I do n't know if it is up there where you are but where I am , the , just like all the hospitals , Uh-huh . they 're getting day care . Are they ? But the reason they had to do this was because so many people , you know , so many women could not afford , like you said if you had four kids , or even if you had two kids , you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go . Right . So , uh , more and more of our hospitals , especially , over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies , but it 's mainly the hospitals . Yeah , I do n't know if the T I in Dallas does or not . I know , I know nobody around here does , it , we 're , it 's too small around here . Oh really . Yeah .
