Um-hum . Like if , like my age , if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party , no , I , they would shell their own , Sure . you know , we 'd just have crawfish and beer or something but , um , if it was more formal like if I was , you know , working environment then I would probably , um , sh , shell 'em or at least disconnect them from the head . But there 's a , Still have see that . There 's a , big thing over here that everybody sucks the head . So , um -- Ooh . -- it , it would just depend . That 's the best part of the crawfish . Sucking the head But um I do n't know it jus- i- it just depends on what type it was I guess But you can buy uh the crawfish shells already peeled 'n everything And usually you use those like for frying Um-hum or to put in salads or to um You know make a sauce with or something like that But you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled and they 're more expensive of course but Does it taste a lot like shrimp Um Yeah Uh-huh . Yeah . Just um The crawfish I mean it just has a taste of its own It also depends on who 's cooking it and how much seasoning they use Sure stuff like that but um I think that And also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps Yeah . We have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks all the time And That 's what I need Yeah that 's what I wish I had but in our family I am the one who who cooks And I I really enjoy it it 's gotten a little more difficult with kids But I really do enjoy cooking And we um we have them over for dinner Uh-huh back and forth quite a lot And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest going where Oh ! you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I 'd try to outdo him and then he 'd try to outdo me and we we was really a lot of fun I bet and that that got pretty competitive Yeah you know as
