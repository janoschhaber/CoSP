Those big piece of something came flaming , falling out of the roof and landed on the field so there 's this big fire on the field and they were dumping the Gatorade bucket and everything . Oh , I ca n't believe that . It was funn , I mean , you just really ca n't tell what 's going to happen . That 's hilarious . I know . It 's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints . Uh-huh . And Morton Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal . Oh . And it , it was beautiful , right down the middle . Oh , boy .
