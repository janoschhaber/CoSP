Okay , so what kind of movies have you seen , lately , I guess ? Um , a lot , well , the last movie I saw , but it was n't my choice , was the NINJA TURTLE movie . Obviously you have kids . That 's right . Yeah , but my preference is the one we saw before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS . I have n't seen that one yet . That 's an excellent movie . Um , the last movie I saw was , uh , SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY . Oh , was that good . I heard , Uh , see , I 'm not a big Julie Roberts fan . Oh , okay . But I was a lot , I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be . Well , that 's good . It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be . Yeah . Yeah , it was a pretty good movie . SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat . I , I 'm ready to go . It just , it 's , you know , has n't worked out that way yet . Right . You know , it 's , uh , it looks good , you know -- Yeah , it is . -- if you like thrillers , anyway . Right . And I do .
