Um , usually when we go , we go to Colorado , to Estes Park area . Uh-huh . Which is up kind of near Denver . Yes . And , uh , stay in the mountains up there , do a little hiking and resting , get away from the Texas heat , that kind of thing . Oh , that 's always refreshing to get away from . So it 's a lot of fun . I worked up there last summer , so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the , Oh , well , that 's nice . whole summer long . Yeah . Worked at a camp there , and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains . So that 's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation . Well , my , uh , my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity , and that 's canoeing . Oh . And , uh , they 've been to the Guadalupe River , and they also , uh , uh , have been to , uh , I guess Colorado , and they 've really enjoyed it . That 's nice . We , um , It 's a whole new , we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River . Uh-huh . And that 's the best place that I 've ever canoed . Huh . It 's really , really pretty . I was a little kid then , and we to have , uh , we stayed at some park and they had a little uh , mountain man who came down the river every night , and he would give a little talk about mountain things .
