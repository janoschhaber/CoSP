And I was going to wait until , um , about my sixth month and then start that . I did that with the second baby , and , um , I went to my exercise class one day , and then she was delivered the next day . Gosh . So , it would seem to be real beneficial . Uh-huh , yeah . Maybe it , maybe it speeded up the process and all that . Well I think it made parts of it a lot easier . And , and is this your first that you 're having ?
