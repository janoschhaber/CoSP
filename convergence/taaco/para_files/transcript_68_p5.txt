Yeah , it 's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere . Yeah , so . But I think we 're getting better at it -- Yeah . -- I think there 's quite a bit more we could do . Girls , put that away . Now . But , you 're right sometimes it does seem like it 's more trouble than what it would be worth . Yeah , I just wish it was a little more conv , convenient -- Yeah . -- to do , you know , seems like you 're so busy anyway , and then that 's just one more thing to have to worry about . So . Yeah , it sure is . I think if , you know , the cities , locally , you know , they 'd get more programs going so that you could do that , it 'd make it a lot easier . So . Yeah , yeah . Well , they 'll get at it sooner . I guess the schools will get into it , too , sooner or later . Yeah , yeah , get the kids -- You know they have , -- interested in it too .
