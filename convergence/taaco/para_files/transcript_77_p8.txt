Uh-huh . I never have been , since , you know , my parents had to force me to get my driver 's license when I was young -- Uh-huh . -- when I was sixteen . So I 've never really cared . Now , what I was , you know , before I was married and before I went to graduate school , I used to do little sports car racing . I never , it was never my own car -- Uh-huh . -- it was always someone else 's . And that sort of thing I enjoy , but to go out and drive , uh , never has really been , had any appeal to me -- Uh-huh . -- in that regard . So . Well I guess we 've discussed that enough do n't you think . I think so . We wo n't , we do n't , we wo n't get the recorder or the , uh , system to shut us off , uh , tonight . That 's happened to me almost every time I 've , That 's happened to me once , So , uh , Well , it 's very easy when you get a top- , you get on a topic that , you know , you enjoy . Yeah , like , uh , I think the one time I did it was on Sau- , the Mid , the Mid East , the crisis out there . Oh , yeah . That was , had a great conversation , but , uh , then they came off and told us we could n't do it any more . So .

Take care . Bye-bye . Good-bye .
