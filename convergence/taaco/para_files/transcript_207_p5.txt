Uh-huh , it is , and you know , you , you do n't spi- , well . Speaking for myself I do n't sleep as well , when I am not exercising , and uh , it 's really , it 's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff , it , your body just gets used to it . Yeah , I , I do n't particularly enjoy it . Well I , I used to lift weights an awful lot , and stuff like that . I do enjoy riding bike , but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that . Uh , I , I ca n't say I really enjoyed it all that much , but once I got used to it , it was habit forming . It was , I felt so bad if I did n't , physically , I mean I just , my body was , was , was uh , tuned into that , that mode , and if I , if I skipped it then it kind of threw the , the whole , the whole system out of whack . Right . Yeah . Right boy , hopefully my , my knee is a hundred percent better . Maybe I can get back into it . Yeah . That 's for sure . Let me ask you a question off the subject though . Okay . You 're in , you 're living in the Castle Park area ? That 's right . I grew up in Oak Cliff . Did you really ? Yes , I did . Uh , just close to Methodist Hospital . Okay , yeah .
