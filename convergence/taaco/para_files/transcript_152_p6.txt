Right . Right . And I hear so many people saying well I wish this would change , I wish that and , you know , but they did n't go vote . That 's right . And , uh , maybe if they , like you said , if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote -- That 's right . -- and all . Then , uh , and the importance of it because , okay , if you do n't vote for your friend over here , well your friend 's not going to have a chance . Tha- , He needs your vote just like he needs everybody else 's , you know . Maybe if they were brought up that a way , like you said , it would . Because I know here , uh , until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines and you voted for like cheerleaders -- Yes . Uh-huh . -- and different things like that but they should start that a lot earlier . Yeah . I , it 's the same way with everything in education though . It should begin and right down in the first grade . Uh , and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first , second or third grade . So that the children develop good learning patterns and you have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning , uh -- Right . -- and not wait until they 're in high school and then it 's too late to try to change them around at that point . Yeah . But , uh , everything should be started on the lower levels
