And , uh , when I seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby , you know , to someone else , it 's just , I can imagine how emotional it must be . And , and , you know , multiplied by the fact that you do n't really trust the person or you 're uncomfortable with the situation MUMBLEx , as far as child care , um , it 's just a scary thing . Well , we were lucky when our children were that age , and having lived in a community for a while and we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children . Huh-uh . That 's a big plus . And felt that , that MUMBLEx , Right . and feeling of safety . Right . And were leaving them MUMBLEx small children . Huh-uh .
