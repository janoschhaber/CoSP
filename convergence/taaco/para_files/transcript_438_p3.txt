Right . But , uh , if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad . Uh-huh . Uh , the State of Wisconsin , as a matter of fact , uh , started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting . Uh-huh . Uh , I do n't think it 's going to go very far , but it , it was , uh , a way of , uh , triggering , uh , awareness . Right , right . So what 's the conditions like in Dallas ? Well , uh , in Dallas , I , I have n't seen air pollution quite on a , quite on a level that we had in Denver . I grew up in Denver , and , and I 've lived there most of my life , and we used to have those , uh , you know , the posted warning days . Uh , however , in Colorado now , they have the emissions control law , which has really cut down , probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to po , post warnings now , you know , as far as health concerns . Um . Uh , due to that emi- , the , the emissions , uh , uh , control on the vehicles , seems that all of our , all of our , uh , smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry . Wisconsin has a , a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag -- Uh-huh . -- and they are tested for , uh , their pollution control equipment , and if they do n't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it , it is drivable . Um . So , they 've , they 've tried to do a lot of that -- Uh-huh . -- and I thi , you know , there seem to be , at least in certain little pockets , and we were talking earlier about Madison -- Uh-huh .
