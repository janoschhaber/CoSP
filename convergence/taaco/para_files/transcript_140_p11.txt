Right . Well , I enjoy playing with my cats . I do n't know if you 'd call that a hobby , but I have two cats , and I gave them a bath tonight , so they 're a little bit angry at me . MUMBLEx . Can you -- They did n't like it too much . -- can you put them right in the water ? Yeah , oh yeah -- Oh , that 's good , -- right in the tub , and it helps because it 's the time of the year that they 're shedding a lot , and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine . So I thought , this 'll help , you know , help them shed , and sure enough , boy the fur just came off like crazy once I got them -- Oh , yeah . -- in the tub . So , they 're pretty content now , but they were mad at me for quite a while . They went and hid after they , after they got dried off . Sulked for a while , huh . Yeah . Well , I like animals , but we do n't have any yet .
