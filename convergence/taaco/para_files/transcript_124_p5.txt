You ca n't go around testing everybody for everything . Yeah . So , I do n't know . And I , I think it could be used to hassle somebody . If someone was out to get you , I think that a company or a boss could use this . You know , they could keep on doing this to you or something , I guess . I can see where it could become a problem . And it , it 's like , it seems like now they have tests I guess they can test your hair and they can find out if you use drugs -- Really . -- up to several years ago . So , -- maybe you should n't be held responsible for something you did several years ago . I know . That 's the other thing . I mean a lot of , a lot of people as kids or , you know , young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I do n't think they should really have to pay for that forever . Yeah . There 's a lot of things you do as a kid that -- Yeah . -- you would n't do as an adult but -- I think that 's true . -- you ca n't say it was wrong at the time . Yeah , yeah . So that probably would n't be too good either .
