Right . the individual , um , because I ca n't really see why anyone , um , who has nothing to hide would object . Well , there is always the , uh , the possibility , even remote as it is , of , uh , of mistaken , uh , of , That 's , of course , that is certainly true , Yeah . yeah . And see that bothers me . I 'm , I 'm a , I mean , I 'm , I 'm very much for drug testing , Uh-huh . uh , I really am . I mean , I 'm going , I 'm going to take the negative side just for a second , Sure . just to do it . Um , see , I have to take , uh , medication for a , uh , for , for kidney transplant . Uh-huh . And I 'm going to be taking that the rest of my life . Now , you , Sure . I do n't know how that 's going to affect , uh , If you had to have a drug test ? Right . Yeah . I mean I have n't had one yet . Um , T I , I work for Texas Instruments -- Uh-huh , uh-huh . -- and , and , uh , we , you know , we do have the random drug testing but I 've missed it so far . But I mean , it , in the back of my mind , it always bothers me . And what happens if it , you know , if it , if they catch it , they think that I 'm , you know , I 'm on drugs and they send me and , and have me , uh , you know , go through this , this , Checked out or whatever . thing , you know , yeah . But it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that . Um , I agree that , that some innocent person might be victimized , Uh-huh . by a false test , but I would think that , um , that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that . For example , that one , uh , positive would not be , uh , accepted as an automatic , um , reason for whatever they might be going , Right . to do if they found a positive , uh , dismissal or treatment or whatever , but that , that what it would do is it would trigger , perhaps , uh , one or two more stages where further tests could be ta- , uh , done .
