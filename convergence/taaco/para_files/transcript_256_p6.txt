And I do n't see any winners or losers , I just see dead bodies . I 'm sorry .

It 's not going to be that we 're going to , uh , you know , sort of , tell them to go to their room and that 's going to solve the whole problem . Yeah . It 's going to be them , But , that 's the type of thing they understand . Yeah . They do n't understand any other way . And , you know , And so at that , at that , you have to work at their level , It 's , to an extent , too . Yeah , that , that 's true too , I , um .

They love violent leaders , to , you know , I mean look at , you know , the leader they had .
