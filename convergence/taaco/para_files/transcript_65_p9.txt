Uh-huh , oh , yeah , but , -- but any big city has a bad section . But there 's a lot of them , it 's very prevalent , a lot of the crime is very prevalent . Yes , they 're very bold it seems . Uh-huh , very much . When we moved here to Monterrey it was a big change , because it 's such a small community , we 're just above Carmel , and , um , there 's hardly , most everybody seems pretty well employed around here , and um , those that are n't , there 's Celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive , which is mostly migrant workers , and there 's a lot of crime there , um , migrant Hispanic farm workers , people that are down and out , and uh , they all seem to congregate in Celinas , not so much here in Monterrey . So , it 's , it 's pretty quiet . You know , we walk the streets at night , and , uh , people run in the park , and you know , you 're just , have your normal smarts about you , then you really do n't have to worry , or , Really , even , uh , even in the worst crime areas in Burlington , I , I can walk the streets . I would n't , I , if I did it every night -- Uh-huh . -- I think there would be trouble in our house , so you would n't get confronted or anything -- Right . -- but I do n't think you would , uh , someone might grab you , mess around with you , but they 're not going to grab you , steal you- , your money and slit your throat -- Uh-huh . -- which in a lot of big cities -- Yeah . -- I mean that 's what you , you 're going to have to expect that to happen . People are just totally unfeeling . Uh-huh , uh , I did n't know that about Burlington , I 'll have to keep that in mind .
