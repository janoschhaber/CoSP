But I was just pulled in so many different directions I was , it was just driving me crazy . And now , with the photography , that 's , you know , it 's working , that 's what I 'm doing , is working part time because I can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the , uh , week -- Yeah . -- and use those hours to do . The thing that I 'm doing is taking school pictures -- Yeah . -- in day cares and in Mother 's Day Out programs , and -- Yeah . -- also soccer teams , and , you know , different stuff like that . Uh-huh . So my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week , or my husband , if it 's , you know , uh , when he 's at home , can take care of them . Yeah , so jobs have to , I guess , become more flexible . I think they 're really going to have to , and not , and not just for mothers , for fathers as well . Yeah . It 's going to have to be both .
