and I live in Raleigh , North Carolina . Oh , okay . Um , do you want to start or should I start ? Go right ahead . Okay , um , I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in . We have , um , three children , and , um , they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports , soccer and baseball and , well , my little girl goes to tap dance , and my little one goes to preschool and , um , I 'm home with the children , just do a lot of running around . It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type , I do n't know , life . Um , what about you ? . I 'm , I 'm single , and I , I live in a town home -- Uh-huh . -- here in Raleigh , and -- Uh-huh . -- it 's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area -- Okay . -- ther- , we , we have a lot of town homes here -- Uh-huh . -- as well as single family homes , and at the time that I bought this one it was just a , a much better arrangement for me personally . I 'm not home a lot . I travel a great deal with -- Uh-huh . -- my job , and so it was easier to have a home that did n't -- Was sort of maintenance free . -- exactly -- Yeah . -- that somebody else looks out for the maintenance . Oh yeah , well , um , that , that sounds , that sounds pretty good for I know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends , not so much now , but to , um , maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds , and it 's a lot of work , owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it . It 's -- It certainly is . -- sometimes I think , um , it would be nice to have a town home , with not having all that responsibility .
