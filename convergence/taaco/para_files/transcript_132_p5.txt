Uh-huh . Oh , okay , well , then I do n't know how much you 've been through it , but I think parts of it made a lot easier . And , I 've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and did n't with the other , and they said that they had ex- , that the one they had exercised with was three or four times easier . Really . And we 've , I had , having both of them natural , the first one was natural and going natural the second , and , and it 's , it 's rough but it 's not as bad as I thought it would be , and I think the exercise helped . Well , that 's good . So , do you work with T I ? No , I do n't . My , my wife has been working with them . Oh , okay , well then she could go if she were interested . Uh-huh . I think , that 's what the class that meets on Saturday mornings . So she could find out if she wanted to go . It 's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy , and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process . And so for us it was educational as well as exercise beneficial . So , At least it 's something you enjoy . I know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say , Well , I do n't want to exercise , it 's too much work . But there 's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you do n't have to strain yourself or sweat -- That 's right . -- or be real sore afterwards . Yeah . And sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like , Well I 've done a good job because I got , worked myself to that point . But I guess that you do n't want to overdo .
