Uh-huh . I mean , we educate them , we feed them , we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they 're back in again . Uh-huh . I 'm not saying they 're all bad , but I think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes , Uh-huh . do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives . Right . I think that they should be put away . Right , and if they 're overcrowded , well , you know , Get rid of them . they should n't have gotten theirself there in the first place . Exactly . I , I really , I , I think that that 's the whole key here . This plea bargaining baloney , Uh-huh . where , uh , you know , they plead to a lesser crime , or , uh , they plead guilty in , or , you know , tell about someone else and they , they get less time , Uh-huh . Or , if they 're in there and they 've got seventeen years and they 're on good behavior , for every year they 're in they get so many less , you know , that they do n't serve the full penalty . Uh-huh . I , I , I really think we 're going to far overboard with all of this . Oh , yeah , I agree , because it 's not fair to those of us that , that deserve a safe , you know , life to have to , Yeah , same with drunk drivers . Right . I think it 's too easy for them .
