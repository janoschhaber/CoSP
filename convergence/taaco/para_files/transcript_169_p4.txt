And , there 's this Montessori school that 's nearby and , um , it had been recommended by some friends of ours but , uh , it , it 's an older place . And so , I , uh , checked out all the new places that were near us and then I checked that place out and , uh , even though it was older , it was , it was real comfortable and , Uh-huh . I guess , kind of homey . Yeah . And they did n't just play all day long . You know , like , I noticed a lot of these other schools that I went and interviewed on , or interviewed at , um , they did a lot of play work and stuff . And then they , almost all of them had a Montessori section . Huh . And I thought , well , gosh , that must be pretty good , you know , if everybody 's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into , Yeah . into , Yeah . their school . And they made sure they pointed it out , you know . But after I looked at this place , and I took Randi with me , uh , I think just about to every place . One place I think I did n't take her . Uh-huh . And , I just kind of let her go , see , see what she felt like doing . Yeah . And that place , boy , if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them and , it 's hard to drag her away . So , I felt more comfortable at , That 's , that place . the true test . Yeah . Yeah . And she was real comfortable . And she has really , really done good . I , I , it 's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her . Yeah . But , she seems to me to be , you know , pretty quick and smart and she 's already reading and writing and stuff ,
