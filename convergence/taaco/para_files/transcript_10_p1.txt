Oh , no , damp . We have , we have gone through , what might be called the four seasons , uh , in the last week . Uh-huh . We have had highs of seventy-two , lows in the twenties . My goodness . Well , I do n't even want to tell you what ours has been like then . It was ninety-six yesterday , I heard about that . and we set a record yesterday . And , uh , very windy , but then today the wind has dropped off , and also , the temperature , so , very cool , uh , I think right now it 's like sixty-nine , Um . and that 's cool for u- , or it feels cool compared to yesterday , but very pleasant , no rain in the last month , I do n't think . The ground 's very dry and our yard work , everything is in bloom , so our yard work is pretty tough , the ground being dry , but I guess it also , uh , brings about allergies , we 're having a lot of allergies down here right now . Uh-huh . Everything blooming , and , and the weather . Uh-huh . And , uh , I think a lot of people have contracted , uh , spring fever too , so . Had a lot of people out at work , you know , for fishing , and , and uh , and golfing , reasons and things like that . The blue flu , Yeah . yeah , the blue flu , or the white collar flu , depending on where you work , I guess . Yes . Oh , we have had , uh , as I 've said , we have had variable weather . Uh , Um . It has been untypically wet for this time of year ,
