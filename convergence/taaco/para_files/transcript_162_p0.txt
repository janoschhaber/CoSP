I guess I don , do n't really have a problem with capital punishment . I 'm not really sure what the exact , uh , specifications are for Texas . I know that they , uh , have capital punishment for certain crimes , and that 's probably the way I feel about it is , is , uh , it kind of depends on the crime that 's committed . My belief all my life , I guess , has been that , that if you take someone else 's life , then you automatically are giving up , uh , yours in place of it . But I do n't , seems to be a lot of controversy about that . Yeah . Uh , uh , I tend to agree with you , uh , you know , probably pretty similar views on it , but that 's , that 's one of the things I do n't , do n't understand is , is so much of the controversy because , uh , you know , I , I do also , myself , believe in capital punishment , uh , uh , you know , it , it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the State when they so callously and usually so , you know , without even thinking or without any concern , uh , you know , end somebody else 's life , and in a lot of cases several people 's lives . That 's true . I guess , well , there 's , there 's probably two or three different types of , of views as far as the controversy goes . I can see where if a life was taken by accident or , uh , I do n't know what you 'd call it , not premeditated or , I guess primarily by accident , , uh , there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for ,
