-- to me that just does n't make any sense , as , as much in debt as we are -- I know it . -- I just , I do n't know . I think it 's definitely time for a change , but I do n't see anybody , I do n't understand , too , why we have to have Democrats and Republicans , and it 's either one way or the other , this -- Right . -- it s , seems to be we 're turning into a black and white society , you either do it this way or you do it that way , and there 's no in between -- That 's right , you 're either liberal or you 're conservative , -- and that , uh , it obviously is n't working . Well , I think , uh , it would n't hurt , and I know the Independent Party 's been trying for years to get a , a , a real force in , in the , uh , in Congress , but , uh , you 're right , there 's just too many issues that come up that , uh , our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it 's a Democratic issue or it 's a Republican issue -- Oh , yeah . -- and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel , I think , uh , we might have a , a lot better , a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed . Oh , I agree with you . Well , of course , you know , we have the national embarrassment in our state , Jessie Helms , and , uh , as soon as , as we can get , of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth , he , he just lines up people against him so , it 's not too , it 's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions . He 's , uh , usually on the ninety-eight to two side , he 's the one of the two that votes , He 's one of the two , huh .
