Yeah . So I understand how that worked . And he was treated like he had five fathers or something . Right . That 's exactly how it is , you know . She 's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her . When things do n't go right , she just calls one of them , you know . Yeah . But , uh , yeah , it , it 's a little bit difficult , though . I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more . And , Did you all do a lot of organized things like , uh , Little League , uh , soccer ? We , we really did not . My next oldest daughter that 's in college in California is a world twirling champion . She twirls a baton and we did a lot of things together . Uh-huh . She and I did a lot of things together and flew , we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform . Uh-huh . And that was a lot of fun . But that , that , I guess you could consider that organized . I mean , there is a competition all the time . Yeah . We were very heavy into that . Other than that , they were pretty much , and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that . You know , I think that 's probably true . The , if you have one child or fewer , you get involved in organized events or -- Uh-huh . -- activities and if you have a large number of children or , then you do n't . Well , you ca n't afford to . No , you ca- , and there 's not enough time , uh -- Right . -- like my son is in , uh , Little League this year .
