Okay , what kind of hobbies do you have ? Um , mostly what I do , I do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing , and then I , I read a lot . Uh-huh . I like to read , too . I was trying to think of some while , while it was , uh , talking about it , and then I , it took so long for someone to answer , I started reading the -- Oh . -- newspaper , and kind of forgot about it . But , uh , yeah , I 'd say reading is probably one of my biggest ones , because it 's the type of thing that you can , you can do a little bit at a time , whereas , I would love to do crafts and stuff if I just had the time to do it -- Uh-huh . -- or if I had the space . I live in a pretty small apartment ,
