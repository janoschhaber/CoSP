Uh , stay in a dormitory if you can . Go to classes , talk to faculty members and students . Yes , and also , uh , depending on how , uh , uh , adjustable your child would be , or , or flexible , I guess it would be , uh , if , if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the , they were unused to their , that , the way they run things , I mean , the , the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges , I think . The people are different and , uh , you have to be more flexible and more willing to , uh , uh , adjust to other people 's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things . You know , you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you 're used to . Uh , Yes , I 'm thinking -- You think so ? -- what , what problems my children might have in that , uh , but I agree with you . Uh , let 's see , what else . Uh , well , climate would be , you know , you 'd have to -- Uh-huh . -- you know , is somewhat , if , uh , if it 's something different than the one they 're used to , I guess , uh , if they 're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need to go out and play all the time , not be in studying . If you 're in Florida or California . Uh , I , I 'd also advise them that , uh , if mom and dad paid for their college , that , uh , if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year , then they 'd have to get a loan to continue . Yeah .
