Uh , I do n't know , I 'm not a real , uh , great football follower , I guess , there are two basic teams that I seem to follow every year . One is the Dallas Cowboys and the other is the Oklahoma Sooners . Oh , okay . Uh , being a native Okie , I uh , I like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing . Uh . I see , so you make it , uh , to that Longhorns Sooners game ? No . Every year . No , it 's funny . Uh , I got out and got my bachelor 's degree in uh , seventy-three and , uh , never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since . How about that . But I always enjoyed watching them , I just growing up in Oklahoma , there it was always the home team , kind of like Dallas is around here . Yeah , yeah . And there 's always been an interest there . Well , it 's kind of same for me , I grew up in southern New Jersey and the local team was Philadelphia . Yeah . And they were like thirty miles right up the river and I 'm still pretty much an Eagle fan , I guess . I guess you keep those things you grew up with . I worked in , uh , Missouri for a while and , uh , I was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on T V when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals and I was rooting for the Cowboys . Yeah . But , they were kind of closer to home when , when I struck up with them .
