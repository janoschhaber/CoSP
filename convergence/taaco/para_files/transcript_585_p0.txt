Actually , to tell you the truth , I think , uh , jury selection is a , uh , prime , uh , discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on , uh , uh , finding of , uh , guilt . Uh , I certainly ca n't argue with that . Definitely does need some improvements . Uh , and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to . Yeah , I think there 's a limit on that . The , uh , the , uh -- I think it 's , -- peremptory challenges are limited to , I do n't know how many , but you can , Four or five , I ca n't remember which . I was on a jury trial last year only I got kicked out as , uh , the last selection that the , uh , defense got . Um . Yeah , it seems to me I 'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things . I think I have a severe demeanor or something .
