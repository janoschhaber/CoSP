yeah . That 's that 's usually the basic criteria . Yeah . I mean , uh , yeah , is it a PAC ten school , you know . Yeah . But I think , yeah , see , I 'm , I 'm at the University of Maryland , so in this , this region , um , though I go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland , my diploma will still say University of Maryland . Oh . Um , you know , it does n't , does n't differentiate on my diploma , though I would put it on my resume , what program I went to . But I , I think , you know , I 'm actually at a smaller program , I 'm not at the col- , the big College Park campus , you know , that 's the big one with the football team . Yeah . So I , I think , um , I think you 're right , that there 's a lot of , there 's difficult decisions there based on name recognition . Um , you know , when I first was applying for graduate schools , I applied to some big programs , you know , in this area , like Stevens Institute of Technology , which is recognized in the Northeast as , as , you know , one step below M I T in a sense , Yeah . you know , so it 's got big name recognition in this area , a big science school , no football team , but a big science school , Yeah . and technical people know that . But I don , yeah , I think you 're right , you really have to think about that for the job . I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor 's , and when I , now , I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs , I was going to be a teacher , I was just a high school teacher , so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of , Yeah .
