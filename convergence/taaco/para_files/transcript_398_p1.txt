and I 'm going into nursing -- Okay . -- so . Well , that sounds interesting . How long of a program is that ? Forever . Seems like , anyways . It 's about five years , but it 's probably going to take me longer , because I did n't decide to major in that until , uh , about a year and a half after I was already in school , so . You know , I read a study once , and it said that , uh , like thirty-four percent of , uh , college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program . Oh , really . That sounds . It took me , it took me five years . Yeah . So , you just , you get started and you change your mind , or you want to pick up a second major , if you 're management , you , you , thought , I , I 'll take that marketing , it 's just only was three more classes -- Yeah . -- you know , and you , just does n't happen that you get out in four years . Uh-huh . But . So what is your advice to -- My advice is -- -- picking a college . -- is , uh , look for , at the student to faculty ratio , you know , if you 're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one , I do n't think you 're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you 're down to the thirty to forty to one . Uh-huh . Is that , what was yours more like ? Yeah --
