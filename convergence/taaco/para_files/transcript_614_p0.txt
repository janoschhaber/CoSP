Actually , I 've been involved in electronics a long time . Uh , in computers and I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home . Oh yeah . Uh , up until , I guess , maybe about a year and a half ago , I got one for my son . A , a Macintosh -- Uh-huh . -- uh , L C . It 's a real easy to use color , uh , computer and I got a very nice printer that goes along with it and he uses it for his school work . Uh-huh . Well , I 've , I 'm currently in school so I , I 've had an I B M clone , I guess , for a couple of years now , which I 've been trying , continually upgrading I guess . And , uh , I 've found , I 've found that I pretty much become addicted to it and I ca n't really , I 've found that most of homework assignments MUMBLEx really require some sort of computer , uh , simulation or analysis , so -- Huh . -- it , it 's pr- , very essential for me . Schools have them , uh , but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school . It 's very easy , it 's much more convenient to have one at home . Where you going to school ? At Georgia Tech . I see . Yeah , so . In engineering ? Yes , actually . So that explains wha , all the , uh , computer assignments . Yeah , it , uh , Well , do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work ? Um , sure . I have some games , of course , which I play on there and , uh , uh , I have a program which allows me to access a , uh , weather data bank so I can , like , check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby . So , it provides other means other than just strict , uh , you know , computations and so on , so . Have you , do you have a computer for yourself at home ? No . No , I just have one for my son
