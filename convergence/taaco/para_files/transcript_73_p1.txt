Okay , but you 're excluding high-level education . Yes , well , yeah I am . Oh , Okay . A- , actually I think that , I , higher level education , I do n't think there 's so much of a problem there . It 's pretty much funded well . There are small colleges that I 'm sure are struggling but , uh , it 's the job that the , the high school and the grade schools are doing that I see , in a area like ours , our school , even a bad school is a good school up here , where , if I lived in New York City or Washington , D C , uh , I would seriously consider moving if I had a child . I would n't let them go to a public school system there . But , of course , people are trapped economically and they ca n't do that . Yeah . I know down here the schools are , you know , I do n't know , they rate , I moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio and the schools down here rate , you know , bottom ten percent across the country and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why . Because they 're so far behind and so poorly staffed , half the time the teachers do n't know what 's going on . Well , that 's really too bad because it , it 's giving some people unfair advantage .
