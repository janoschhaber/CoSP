B: Okay ,
B: what do you usually wear to work ? .
A: Well , uh , I am basically retired now .
B: Uh-huh .
A: I was a member ,
A: I was in education and in administration ,
B: Uh-huh .
B: Uh-huh .
A: And , uh , heels ,
A: and I was never one , uh , because my work often took me into court , uh , never was one that got , uh , accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work .
B: Uh-huh .
A: But that was just me .

----- Topic 1 start at 12 -----
A: I know many people are co , very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants .
A: Uh , it ,
A: I guess I was just old enough not to , uh , be very comfortable in it .
B: Uh-huh .
A: How about you ?
B: Well , I work at T I
B: and they do n't really have , uh , dress code , so to speak there .
B: It 's pretty lax about , um , you know ,
B: we- , you can pretty much wear whatever you want to ,
B: and I wear anything from jeans , when I 'm feeling really casual to , uh , suits and dresses when I 'm meeting with a customer
A: Oh .
B: and so when I 'm teaching a class , obviously I wear a suit or dress ,
A: Uh-huh .
B: It , it , uh , definitely fluctuates mainly with what I 'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is
B: and when it 's raining ,
B: I 'm more likely to wear jeans
B: and , and when it 's really cold I 'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters , or that type of thing .
A: Uh-huh .
B: Um , but it just really depends on the weather and my mood
B: and then , you know , obviously when I 'm doing anything that I 'm in front of people , or , or making presentations , teaching , whatever .
A: Yes .
B: I 'm going to dress up more .
A: And I think that does make a difference ,
A: because when you do have to be in front of people ,
B: Uh-huh .
A: uh , I think you , the , the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and , and , uh , more classical style of clothing .
B: Uh-huh .
A: What about the mini skirt ?
B: There are a few people every now and then that wear those to work .
B: They 're pretty strict about that , though .
B: Um , I 've never worn ,
B: I just would n't ,
B: I mean even to ,
B: well jeans are n't exactly professional
B: but , for some reason a mini skirt is , to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans
B: just because it 's , maybe it 's just because of the sexist views and everything
B: but you just feel like you 're , you 're being , showing too much le- ,
B: I do n't know ,
B: I would n't want to wear a mini skirt to work .
A: We- ,
B: I have seen a few people do it though ,
B: but they , they were n't overly shor ,
B: and they were n't overly revealing .
B: They were pretty much in good taste ,
B: but , um ,
A: Uh-huh .
B: for me I just , I just , cou , would n't want to do that .
A: Well there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts .
B: Yeah .
A: There are some that are really short
A: and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee .
B: Uh-huh ,
B: that 's what I 've seen .
A: and again it depends upon the size , the shape of the person ,
B: Uh-huh .
A: as well as the shape of the person 's legs .
B: Uh-huh .
A: Now , I also , uh ,
A: even though I retired from education , I , uh , I do modeling
A: and I teach at a modeling agency here .
B: Uh-huh .
A: And , uh , so , when we are doing wardrobing and we have , uh , two , two hour classes in wardrobe , we do discuss a great deal , the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job .
B: Uh-huh .
A: Uh , even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through , uh , grandmothers ,
B: Uh-huh .
A: in my class .
A: And , uh , whe , I always try to emphasize the , clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad ,
B: Uh-huh .
A: because maybe they , those are not the clothes that are the most , uh , appealing to you , or the most , uh , complimentary to you .
B: Right .
A: But , uh , the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you do n't really want .
B: Right .
A: And , and then , uh , then you 're in the situation where you 're very unhappy .
B: Uh-huh .
B: Well I feel like too , on the job , when , you know , there 's men around and some of the managers are men , you just , you know , you do n't want them looking at your legs necessarily .
A: That 's right .
B: And , uh , to me I just would n't feel comfortable in that at work ,
B: but , uh ,
A: Well , I , I , uh , I have to , uh , agree with that , even when they was very , very popular in the early sixties ,
B: Uh-huh .
A: uh , I , uh , uh ,
A: again maybe because I was at the school , there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts ,
B: Uh-huh .
A: uh , we had no regulation against it
A: and a lot of the kids did of course ,
A: and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers .
B: Right .
A: Because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts .
B: Right .
A: And so , I think , uh , uh , of course , now I go the other extreme , I do not like to see , in the corporate areas , uh , all the women dressed like men ,
B: Uh-huh .
A: with the suits and , uh , white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same .
B: Uh-huh .
A: Uh , I do n't like that ,
A: I do n't ,
A: I think there should be individuality in dressing .
B: Uh-huh .
B: Even with the very tailored look of a suit , sometimes I like to have someth- , a lit , just a little something that 's feminine .
A: Yes .
B: Not , you know ,
B: you do n't want to over do it but , just a little , a touch of it just to say , yes , I am a woman ,
A: Right .
B: but I can be professional too .
A: Well , I , and I do n't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to , to look professional .
B: Right ,
B: uh-huh .
A: I think that you , you make of that what you wish
A: and you can go the opposite direction and , uh , over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you , which do n't belong in the , in , at least in my opinion , in the work place ,
B: Right .
A: Uh , but that , that
A: you can have a classical look without a lot of , a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine .
B: Uh-huh .
A: Because that was one thing I always fought against .
A: I started out as a physical education teacher .
B: Uh-huh .
A: So I was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish ,
B: Right .
A: uh , and people would never , ever guess that I was Phys Ed
A: and , um , and that pleased me ,
B: Uh-huh .
A: uh , and so , then I , of course , just continued what I considered the best style of clothing for me at work
A: and , uh , and I find even , even at home here now , I , I will wear blue jeans or I 'll wear shorts and what have you , uh , and be very comfortable
A: but when I go out somewhere , then , uh , unless I have a pair of dress slacks , I do n't usually wear a lot of blue jeans .
B: Uh-huh .
A: I have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how .
B: Uh-huh .
A: And , so , uh , uh , I just feel that , uh , you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort .
B: Uh-huh .
A: But , uh , there are certain norms that companies should be able to , uh , put out as guidelines for their employees .
B: Right ,
B: that 's what I , one thing I like about T I is that they are n't overly strict about what you wear
B: and they do n't , you know , your boss does n't come up to you and say now remember , tomorrow you have a meeting so you 'd better wear a suit .
B: I mean , they , they leave it up to you and your judgment to ,
A: Right .
B: to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have .
A: Yes .
B: The only real restrictions they have are , uh , no halter tops and no shorts , even the long walking short of the squirts , the , the split skirts ,
A: Yes .
B: anything that , that could be considered shorts they do n't allow .
A: That 's good .
B: And they do n't allow , uh , any sweat , any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar , or , you know , anything like that on it ,
B: but ,
A: Yeah ,
A: uh-huh .
B: other than that , it 's pretty , pretty lax
B: and I think that 's good because it does allow people to be individual
B: and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day .
A: Yes .
B: Or , you know , if you want to be comfortable and casual you can ,
A: Right .
B: Whereas , uh , sometimes when you 're in the suit and feel , kind of almost stiff and you 're not , you know , maybe you do n't , uh , ca n't get as comfortable to sit down
B: and , you know , like when I 'm writing training material , I prefer to be more comfortable unless I know I have to meet with a customer later during the day .
A: Right ,
A: right .
B: So , that 's I think , that is good that they 're like that .
B: I do know there 's a lot of companies that are very strict about what the employees wear
B: and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and ,
A: Yeah .
B: you know , no variation ,
B: and I do n't , I do n't quite agree with that .
A: Yeah ,
A: well , I do n't either .
A: Fortunately I do n't have to work in those companies .
B: Right .
A: But , uh , I , I , uh , did have a group come over from one of the banks , over the children 's hospital where I was volunteering
A: and , uh , they were doing a presentation
A: and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly a like , men and women .
A: They all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or sla- , or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie .
B: Uh , right .
A: And one was a skirt and one was a pant .
B: Yeah .
A: And , uh , and I think that 's sad because that does n't allow for any individuality .
B: Uh-huh .
A: That 's , uh , can stifle creativity .
B: Right ,
B: I agree .
A: So .
B: Well , it ,
B: I guess we 've talked probably long enough .
A: I guess so ,
A: well it 's been nice talking with you .
B: Nice talking to you too ,
B: I enjoyed it .
A: Uh-huh ,
A: bye , bye .
B: Bye , bye .
