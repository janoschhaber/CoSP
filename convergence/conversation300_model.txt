B: Okay .
B: Do you , have you ever had to put your children in , child care , Mary Dell ?
A: Oh yes .
A: I 'm an old experienced hand .

----- Topic 2 start at 4 -----
A: I started back when it was n't ,
A: stylish to do that at all .
A: My daughter that 's seventeen now --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- I worked even when she was a baby .
B: Oh .
A: And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two
A: and then I was really lucky to have put them in a ,
A: Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist , right off --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- of Walnut Hill and Preston .
B: Uh-huh .
A: And it was a wonderful environment .
A: I , I just wish all kids , if they have to be put in day school , could have that kind of place .
B: Uh-huh .
B: I see .
A: So , it worked well .
B: Oh .
A: How about you ?
B: Well , I have , uh , a nine year old and a six year old
B: and neither one of them has ever been in --
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- in , uh , day care for the reason of , of me working --
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- but , uh , they both went through preschool .
A: Yeah .
B: And , uh , we 've just been real lucky --
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- I think , anyway . To not ,
A: It 's not hard to find anything that 's part-time .
A: So many of the churches have really strong --
B: Right ,
B: like half day programs .
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- preschool and children 's day out --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- but , it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little
A: and this is one of the few churches that did it .
A: There were a couple downtown Dallas
A: but they were so , seemed ,
A: cold and impersonal ,
A: I just could n't hack it .
B: Uh-huh .
A: And what I liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two , which was fifteen years ago , many of them are still there today .
A: So there --
B: Oh .
A: -- was real continuity .
A: She went back as a teenager
A: and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there .
B: Oh , my gosh .
A: So , it , it was really neat .
A: But it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love
A: and --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- she just kept good people and --
B: Oh my goodness .
A: -- real cheerful place , lots of arts and crafts ,
A: and I 'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that .
B: Right .
B: Right .
B: Yeah .
A: That if they had n't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff .
B: Uh-huh .
B: Yeah ,
B: that is , uh , a big drawback I think in that , in the , uh , public schools out here .
A: Uh-huh .
B: You know , to ,
B: you 're lucky to have an art teacher
B: and if you do you get them once a week or something , you know .
A: Or pay for it after school .
A: Our Emily 's in the third grade over at Huffman
A: and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art
A: and --
B: Oh is that right ?
B: I had no idea .
A: -- you know , I willingly did it
A: but I thought ,
A: this makes me angry .
A: This is something that ought to be in the schools --
B: Oh my goodness .
A: -- rather than some of the other stuff they do .
B: And with our budget cuts , I 'm sure --
A: Yeah .
B: -- that 's not going to not going to change anytime soon .
A: Well that 's the only way they 're . Yeah , well , that 's the only way they 're going to be able to do it .
A: And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that .
B: Oh my goodness .
A: So , in some ways I think the , the day schools do serve those purposes .
B: Yeah .
B: That 's true .
B: Well even the preschools , you know they get so much of that in preschool
B: and then when they hit kindergarten , you know , it 's like wham .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
B: Culture shock .
B: It 's just ,
A: Put the colors away .
B: Yeah ,
B: yeah .
B: Get the computers out --
A: Which is too bad .
B: -- and , you know .
A: Uh-huh .
B: That 's hard .
A: Uh-huh .
B: It 's so difficult for them .

----- Topic 3 start at 110 -----
B: Um , did you have your children , did you say in home , in , in , private care ,
B: was that in your home or in someone else 's home ?
A: Until they were two .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah ,
A: both times they were at our house .
B: Uh-huh .
B: So you were able to have somebody come there .
A: And that was hard too .
A: I , I lucked out with really good people both times
A: but I know so many people that are never able to find that
A: and I 'd practically give my paycheck away to do it ,
A: so .
B: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
B: Did you have a nanny
B: or did you have someone --
A: Yeah .
B: -- that lived in with you ?
A: Well no ,
A: she did n't live with us .

----- Topic 4 start at 131 -----
A: Uh , the first one was an ,
A: elderly lady who was putting a , a daughter through nursing school --
B: Oh .
A: -- just purely on baby-sitting money .
B: Oh my goodness .
A: And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night .
B: Uh-huh .
A: And she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had --
B: Yeah .
A: -- because both our parents are dead .
B: Oh .
A: So that , that was a plus from --
B: Oh gosh .
A: -- that respect as well .
A: And then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- that kept her .
B: Uh-huh .
A: So ,
B: I have , uh ,
A: I just can not fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center .
B: Uh-huh .
B: I was just listening to a program this morning ,
B: oh well , I guess it was on the HOME SHOW ,
B: but they were talking about , uh , a new , uh , ,
B: oh I ca n't even think of the name of it .
B: I was halfway listening while I was painting .
A: Uh-huh .
B: Um , it 's some kind of advisory board they 've put together for parents and children --
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- and they 've now moved it to Washington , D C
B: and the , the doctor that was on there , the pediatrician said , you know , I ca n't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care --
A: Yeah .
B: -- and leaving them there .

----- Topic 5 start at 165 -----
A: Oh that would be hard .
B: You know , so , um ,
A: Well , they give a lot more leave .
A: I work at N C N B now ,
A: and our benefits for maternal and , and parental care and even for elderly people --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- are , are really expanding .
A: We have more options now then we did when I , my kids were born ,
A: with being able to take off full-time longer --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- of , you can phase your schedule in so that it 's not full-time for --
B: Oh boy , that 's great .
A: -- up to six months .
A: It 's really neat .
A: I 've , I 've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week
A: or they 've , you know , whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint .
B: Uh-huh .
B: Uh-huh .
A: We try to work it with their hours .
A: And that helps because you do n't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say --
B: Yeah .
A: -- okay , I never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again .
B: Right .
B: Right .
A: And the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals .
A: I 've ,
A: of course it 's too late for me so --
B: Yeah .
A: -- I 've , I 've not tried them to see how effective they are
A: but --
B: Uh-huh .
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- I think we 're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast .
B: God , it 's amazing .

----- Topic 6 start at 199 -----
A: And for our age group it 's too late , too little , too late .
B: Right .
B: Right .
A: But I , I do think it 's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work .
B: Uh-huh .
B: Uh-huh .
A: Two income families I think are here to stay .
B: Well and I would think , you know , since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do --
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- you know , the , the people that work in big business have families --
A: Right .
B: -- they have children .
A: Yeah .
B: So , it 's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and --
A: Oh sure .
B: -- working
B: and , uh ,
A: You retain employees and keep them longer .

----- Topic 7 start at 217 -----
A: That 's , that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- Employee Assistance Programs that --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to --
B: Right .
A: -- split ourselves in fifteen million pieces .
B: Right .
B: Right .
A: So , I , I hope it helps .
A: It seems to help the new mothers --
B: Oh that 's good .
A: -- not have to come back full-time .
A: because that 's hard .
B: That 's good to know .

----- Topic 8 start at 232 -----
B: I have a couple of friends that ,
B: have , have found the , uh , you know , a pri , a private home to take their children to when they 're young --
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- until they hit the preschool age .
A: Uh-huh .
B: And they
B: usually , you know , you 'll find a , a woman that 's keeping like six children or --
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- four to six children in the home
B: and my future , future sister-in-law 's mother does that too , full-time .
A: Well in Plano though the problem is , you find ,
A: and this is what I found with Emily .
A: I , from the time she started first grade , I wanted her out in Plano area .
B: Uh-huh .
A: And I kept finding neighbors and friends
A: and they 'd move .
B: Oh .
A: She ended up being in a different home every year .
B: Too transit .
B: Uh-huh .
A: And I finally decided I did n't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move .
B: And her surroundings .
A: So this year I , I tried Kinder-Care
A: and ,
A: then she 's old enough to ,
