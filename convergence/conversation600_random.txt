A: Okay .
B: I say they , uh ,
B: probably the best things to do is , is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water
B: if they sink --
A: I see .
A: A --
B: -- they 're innocent right .
A: -- a good , a good southern solution .
B: Yeah .
B: Uh , so , uh , how do you , how do you feel ?
B: Th- , that 's , of course , being facetious
B: but .
A: Uh-huh .
A: You 'd have to say that .

----- Topic 1 start at 14 -----
A: Uh , I do n't know .
A: The , the things they asked to talk about were whether the , uh , whether the judge should be the one that does the , uh , sentencing .
B: Uh-huh .
A: And seems to me that that 's , I think that 's the way it 's done now .
A: Uh , at least ,
A: my understanding of the law which is n't very good .
B: Uh-huh .
A: Uh , it seems to me that the judge does it
A: and I , I think that 's probably all right in that they , you know , maybe know what the , the norm is --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- for a particular thing .
B: And , I guess , also what the system will absorb .
A: Right .
B: Probably more tuned in to that .
B: Possibly though on , uh , capital cases like maybe the death penalty --

----- Topic 2 start at 29 -----
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- uh , I 'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole ,
B: I mean he could have like a personal prejudice .
B: You know , judges are people like everybody else --
A: That 's right .
B: -- even though they 're , they 're supposed to be impartial
B: but maybe , uh ,
A: And I think that may , I , that may be an exception as well .
A: Because I think that ,
A: does n't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than , than the judge ?
B: I , I think that 's , I think that 's the way it is .
A: Yeah .
B: Uh , whether they , they decide whether or not they , uh , the accused or whatever would get the , uh , get the death penalty .
B: Do they have a death penalty in California ? .
A: Yes .
A: In --
B: Yeah .
A: -- fact , they 're going to execute somebody at the end of this month .
B: Uh-huh .
A: And , uh , there 's a big uproar going on right now . Uh --
B: Yeah .
A: -- the , uh , Governor , you know , has been trying to decide whether he 's going to commute it or not .
B: Uh-huh .
A: You know , it 's someone who had , uh ,
A: killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact .
B: Yeah .
B: I ,
B: something like that , I 've got no problem with it . Uh --
A: Yeah .
B: -- I guess the way I think about it is not , it should n't necessarily be thought of as revenge .

----- Topic 3 start at 59 -----
B: It 's just like if you 've got like a dog that 's running wild and biting people --
A: Uh-huh .
B: -- put it to sleep , you know .
B: Just get it out , you know ,
B: it 's not able to fit in , you know .
A: Something inexpensive .
B: Yeah .
B: Yeah ,
B: exactly .
B: Uh , I guess ,
B: kind of the way I think about it also , is they just ,
B: if somebody gets the death penalty , they 're , they 're judged guilty ,
B: they got the death penalty ,
B: they should have one year and one appeal . Cover all their bases with one appeal
B: and if not , you know , do n't , do n't let them sit up there on death row for , you know , fifteen years .
A: Yeah .
A: I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years .
B: Uh-huh .
B: Yeah ,
B: that ,
A: But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake
A: and --
B: Yeah .
B: Oh , I 'm sure .
A: -- you 'd hate to be one of those .
B: Yeah .
A: The other thing they asked about was whether uh , uh , the verdict should be required to be unanimous .
B: Uh-huh .
A: Which , again , I think is the way it is now . That all the , all verdicts ,
A: well maybe not .
A: I do n't know .
A: At least in capital cases I 'd think they 'd have to be --
B: I believe it is --
A: -- unanimous .
B: -- in capital .
B: I think in like , uh , lesser cases it 's like ten out of twelve or five out of six , whatever .
A: Uh-huh .
B: How ever many is on , sitting on a jury .

----- Topic 4 start at 97 -----
B: I t- , I believe that 's the way it is .
B: But I 'm pretty sure you 're correct on capital cases . Uh ,
A: Yeah .
A: The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial .
B: Uh-huh .
A: And that there 's one juror that is , is , uh , different than the other eleven .
B: Yeah .
A: And , uh , they 've only deliberated four hours or ,
A: something
A: and they say they 're hopelessly deadlocked .
B: Oh , no .
A: And the judge told them ,
A: they were n't hopelessly deadlocked yet .
B: I 'm telling you , go one way or the other .
B: That , that 's probably an expensive trial . Uh ,
A: Yeah .

----- Topic 5 start at 113 -----
A: Six months so far they said .
B: Yeah .
B: Probably .
A: So .
B: Yeah .
B: Probably .

----- Topic 6 start at 119 -----
B: You know , I 'm not sure there 's a number .
B: It 's probably like thirty , forty thousand dollars a day you know , worth of all the free for all .
A: Maybe they could go with a , with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their , uh , vote .
B: Yeah .
B: Yeah ,
B: that 's , that 's been so long I 've prac- , practically forgot who Noriega was , you know .
A: Right .
B: That has been going on .
B: My , uh , cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami .
A: Oh really ?
B: Yeah .
B: So she follows that stuff pretty closely .
B: But , uh ,
A: That 's interesting .
B: Yeah ,
B: she 's not involved in that , that case .
B: But she does ,
A: Well have you ever served on a jury ?
B: No
B: I have n't .
B: I never have .
B: My wife has
B: but I , I have n't .
A: Uh-huh .
A: I got called
A: but I , uh , never , uh , got selected for a jury ,
B: Uh-huh .
A: I sat for tw- , ten days --
B: Uh-huh .
A: -- in a court room while they went through the selection process ,
A: and they had some guy that was , uh , defending himself .
B: Uh-huh .
